@0 = ~So... *this* is the latest group of entrants, is it? Very well. My name is Jaroo - Master of the Games. Allow me to explain how this will work:~ [NWJAR050]
@1 = ~Entrance to the dungeon costs 1000 gold. Exiting this dungeon through the north door will take you to the first level of the labyrinth, there are three levels in total. You must explore all the dungeons and find the four crystal items. If you can do that and answer the riddle, you will return here as winners.~
@2 = ~Neither I nor Mutamin are responsible for your deaths or the deaths of your companions. If you enter, it is your risk to take.~ [NWJAR056]
@3 = ~Now, then, should anyone wish to enter, approach me with your gold and I'll let you into the maze.~ [NWJAR057] 
@4 = ~Yes, my <LADYLORD>? Are you ready to enter the dungeon?~ [NWJAR051]
@5 = ~Yes, I am. Here is your 1000 gold.~ 
@6 = ~I'm not ready yet.~ 
@7 = ~Yes, but is 1000 gold pieces really necessary?~
@8 = ~Excellent, come on in, I'll open the grate. And let the contest begin!~

@10 = ~As you desire. I shall remain here, should you change your mind.~
@11 = ~It is. Each entry is added to the total that will be given to the winner who makes it through the dungeon. Since you have an equal chance of succeeding, I'm afraid it wouldn't be fair to offer a discount. So are you ready for the competition?~ 
@12 = ~Hurry up, <LADYLORD>. The competition has already begun, and the other competitors may be ahead of you.~
@13 = ~You've won the competition. Congratulations! Speak to Mutamin to collect your reward!~ [NWJAR052]
@14 = ~The competition has been won. Come back another time, when the dungeon has been re-worked for the sequel!~ [NWJAR053]
@15 = ~I'm sorry, but you lost the competition. Come back another time, when the dungeon has been re-worked for the sequel!~
