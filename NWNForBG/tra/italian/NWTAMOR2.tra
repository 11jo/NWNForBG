@2 = ~I guess I shouldn't be joking with all the suffering around us. Especially not while Luce's baby sister is still missing. Poor little girl.~
@3 = ~When I look at all the wounded I can't help but curse those Luskan dogs for what they have done.~

@6 = ~Aren't you a handsome one? Come back when all this is over and I'll give you a night of pleasure you'll never forget... and at a very reasonable price! Just ask for Tamora.~
