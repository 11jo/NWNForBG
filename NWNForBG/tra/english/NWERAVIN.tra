@0 = ~NP: Stand back, <SIRMAAM>. All these poor people are victims of the plague. You could be infected, as far as I'm concerned.~ /*I urge you to keep away from these bodies, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. There is a risk of contagion, I understand.*/
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I'll answer what I can. Just keep back from the pile, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Try not to breath the fumes directly... ugh... it's disgusting...~
@4 = ~Aren't you in danger of becoming infected yourself?~
@5 = ~Where are all these dead people coming from?~
@6 = ~This can't be a pleasant task for you.~
@7 = ~I'm investigating the plague. Perhaps you could tell me more about it.~
@8 = ~Can you tell me what's going on in this area?~
@9 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@10 = ~Begone and leave me to my grim task.~
@11 = ~I am. If I fall, I will be far from the first amongst the city guard to do so. All I can ask is that Helm watch over me and protect me from this evil.~
@12 = ~NP: These? Of course, they're all victims of the plague. Many of these nitwits tried to sneak into the Heart of the City and died at the quarantine gates. Although some of them are locals. Despite our best efforts, the Howling Death has reached the center. I think it's going to get worse. Until it gets better.~ /*Some of them are locals, however. The Wailing Death has come to the core, despite our efforts. I expect things will only get worse before they get better.*/
@13 = ~It seems a shame to burn these poor souls, to not even give them a decent burial. We have no choice, however. Ilmater help us, no choice at all.~
@14 = ~NP: Not at all. The Howling Death has already taken my wife and my only son. I don't think it can get any worse. If I get the plague, that's nothing. At least I'll see my family again. There are other guards, at least they have someone to live for.~ /*If I catch the plague here, it won't be so bad. At least I'd see my family again. There are other guards that still have folks to live for.*/
@15 = ~Everyone knows something about the plague. Half of it isn't true and the other half is rumor. I'm not sure I can add much to it all.~
@16 = ~What can you tell me about the plague?~
@17 = ~Have you heard anything about strange animals in the area?~
@18 = ~NP: I'd like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@19 = ~The Wailing Death is going on, fool. Ahhh, don't mind me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. The core is no place for any sane man to be these days.~
@20 = ~I am not from this district. Nor would I be inclined to point your way, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, even if I were. Ask someone else for aid.~
@21 = ~NP: Other than the obvious? The gods can't seem to cure Howling Death. All those church blessings are completely useless. You'd think the gods had forgotten about us, wouldn't you? You only expect the worst. You'd think it'd be winter soon. Is there anything else you need?~ /*Besides the obvious? The Wailing Death can't be cured by the gods, it seems. None of them clerics' blessings do a thing.*/
@22 = ~NP: Animals? Something familiar. I've heard of animals coming from Waterdeep, but that's all. No doubt something in the city is troubling the guards. But as long as I'm on this post, they don't tell me much.~ /*No doubt it's something for the others in the city guard to worry about. In this post, they don't tell me much.*/
@23 = ~So you haven't heard about any animals in this area?~
@24 = ~What do you want to know?~
@25 = ~NP: *Sighs* Look what I'm doing, <SIRMAAM>. Few people would dare to speak to me from a distance, if at all. Perhaps you'd be better off asking at the local tavern. Is there anything else you wanted?~ /**Sigh* Look at what I do, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Very few people care to talk to me at length, if at all. Maybe you'd have more luck asking these things at a local tavern.*/
@26 = ~Stand back. These bodies carry the plague.~
