@0 = ~Oh, I didn't see you there. You startled me.~
@1 = ~I'm very sorry. What is your name?~
@2 = ~Can you maybe answer questions for me?~
@3 = ~MT: Как твое имя?~ /*What's your name?*/
@4 = ~No be scared. Me have questions.~
@5 = ~MT: Извини. Я пойду.~ /*Okay. Me go now.*/
@6 = ~MT: Ох, вы так любезны. Меня зовут Джахиль. А какое же имя носит такое милое существо, как вы?~ /*Oh, you are so sweet. My name is Jaheel. And what do they call a handsome <PRO_GIRLBOY> such as yourself?*/
@7 = ~MT: Меня зовут <CHARNAME>. Очень приятно познакомиться, Джахиль.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you, Revat.*/
@8 = ~You no ask name. You not need know.~
@9 = ~MT: Извини, мне нужно уходить.~ /*Excuse me, I must be going.*/
@10 = ~I could think of nothing more pleasant than to while away a day chatting with you... if only it was not such a terrible day.~
@11 = ~I am sorry your day is so dark. Might I ask for your name?~
@12 = ~I am hunting the cult that started the plague in Neverwinter. Have you heard anything about them?~
@13 = ~I wish I could help you, but I am in need of a job. Do you know of anything?~
@14 = ~You seem like a very lonely person. My name is Jaheel. What is your name?~
@15 = ~They call me <CHARNAME>.~
@16 = ~My name isn't important right now.~
@17 = ~I'm going now.~
@18 = ~I guess I could, although my mind is occupied with worry about this terrible day.~
@19 = ~Who you be?~
@20 = ~You know stuff 'bout cult that start bad plague in Neverwinter, maybe?~
@21 = ~MT: Мне нужна хорошая работа.~ /*Me need good job.*/
@22 = ~A fitting name for one as fascinating as you, <CHARNAME>. (sigh) I only wish my mind could dwell on more pleasant conversation. Is there something I can help you with?~
@23 = ~A man of mystery. While I love an intrigue, today is just too bleak a moment in my life to give you proper attention. Can I help you?~
@24 = ~MT: Мне бы очень хотелось вам помочь, но мой ум слишком утомлен, и мне очень трудно сконцентрироваться на чем-либо, кроме моих собственных проблем.~ /*I wish I could help you, kind <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but my mind is overwrought and it is very difficult for me to focus on anything other than my own troubles.*/
@25 = ~MT: Что с тобой случилось?~ /*What happened here?*/
@26 = ~MT: Твои проблемы мне не интересны, мне нужно уходить.~ /*You beg, but me still kill you!*/
@27 = ~Oh my, but you are a brave, powerful adventurer aren't you! If you want a job, maybe you could help me?~
@28 = ~MT: Это так ужасно. Мне нужно было привести моего маленького брата Неву в город, чтобы купить ему подарок на десятый день рождения. Он был так рад, что все время бежал впереди меня. Он забежал на холм, а потом вдруг закричал. Я со всех ног побежала на вершину холма, но когда подбежала поближе, услышала мужские голоса. Я упала на землю и выглянула из-за вершины холма.~ /*It is so horrible. I was supposed to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a birthday present for his tenth birthday. He was so excited he kept running ahead of me.*/
@29 = ~MT: Неву окружила банда разбойников. Они схватили его и со смехом куда-то потащили. Я просто не знаю, к кому мне обратиться. Стражники заняты своими собственными проблемами, а мне нужен тот, кто быстро спасет его.~ /*I simply don't know who to turn to. The guards are busy with their own troubles and I need someone who can rescue him quickly.*/
@30 = ~Why do you think the bandits took him captive?~
@31 = ~Do you know where the bandits took him?~
@32 = ~Are you offering a reward for his rescue?~
@33 = ~I would love to rescue him for you.~
@34 = ~MT: Я совсем не хочу, чтобы банда разбойников перерезала мне горло. Прощайте.~ /*That's rough, but I'm not really interested in getting my throat slit by a gang of thugs. Goodbye.*/
@35 = ~I imagine it is because he had his birthday money in his purse. He had 10 gold pieces to spend for his birthday. That is a lot, so the bandits probably figured he was from a wealthy home and they want to ransom him.~
@36 = ~Yes. I quietly followed them to some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood. I thought for sure they would catch me, but I was lucky.~
@37 = ~I have 300 gold, which I would reward anyone who could save my baby brother.~
@38 = ~My hero! Thank you so much for being brave. I must admit, that if you are able to rescue my baby brother, there are rewards besides gold that I would be willing to discuss.~
@39 = ~MT: Я знаю, что Неву держат в бандитском лагере около вертикальных камней рядом с Чарвудом, но мне неизвестно, сколько именно людей охраняют его и чего от них можно ожидать. Пожалуйста, поспешите! Приведите его ко мне в целости!~ /*I know Neva is being held at a bandit camp near some standing stones just outside of Charwood, but I have no idea how many people are holding him or what exactly to expect.*/
@40 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@41 = ~A young man by the name of Neva has apparently been kidnapped by bandits. According to his siblings, Tarran and Jaheel, he is being held near some standing stones by the entrance to the Charwood. Adventurers are to meet the siblings there to attempt a rescue.~
@42 = ~MT: Считай, что Нева уже спасен. Не волнуйся.~ /*Neva is as good as rescued. Do not worry, my lady.*/
@43 = ~You are back so soon? Have you found my little brother?~
@44 = ~I can't remember where you said that stone formation was.~
@45 = ~Not yet, but I'm working on it.~
@46 = ~Don't rush me. I'll save him eventually.~
@47 = ~It is in the hills just outside of Charwood. If you search carefully you should find it.~
@48 = ~MT: Очень хорошо, я жду с нетерпением. Смелее, мой герой!~ /*I am glad you still have the ring I gave you. Be brave my hero!*/
@49 = ~Neva might be dead soon! Please hurry, if only so that you can claim your reward.~
@50 = ~MT: Вы вернулись? Мне так нужна ваша помощь.~ /*All hands to me! I need your aid!*/
