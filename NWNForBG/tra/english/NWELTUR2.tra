@0 = ~NP: Welcome. I'm Eltura Sarptil, and it's unlikely you'll find such a fine selection of merchandise from anyone else.~ [NWELT055] /*Welcome to the shop, as I like to say. I am Eltoora Sarptyl, and not a finer collection of wares are you apt to find.*/
@1 = ~I have one of the tomes you seek.~
@2 = ~NP: I have all the books you are looking for.~ /*I have one of the tomes you seek.*/
@3 = ~NP: What kind of products do you sell?~ /*What kind of wares do you sell here?*/
@4 = ~Can I see your merchandise?~

@8 = ~Offer Tome of Fire.~
@9 = ~Offer Tome of Ice.~
@10 = ~Offer Tome of Life.~
@11 = ~Offer Tome of Death.~
@12 = ~Offer Tome of Resonance.~
@13 = ~I'd rather not part with the tomes just yet.~
@14 = ~Why, I sell only the finest assortment of magical goods. Truly, you will find no better collection than mine.~
@15 = ~Yes, this will do quite well. Come, let us take a look at what we have to offer you then, shall we?~
@16 = ~You may as well spill the question, and I'll see if I can figure out an answer for you.~
@17 = ~Have you heard anything about werewolves near Port Llast?~
@18 = ~I'm looking for work. Do you know of any?~
@19 = ~I need some directions, actually.~
@20 = ~NP: Can you remind me of this work of finding books?~ /*Can you remind me about that tome-recovery job?*/
@21 = ~NP: I wish you an enjoyable <DAYNIGHT>, <SIRMAAM>. Please come back again.~ /*I wish you a good <DAYNIGHTALL>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Please come back again.*/
@22 = ~NP: Ah, Tom of Fire! This will be a wonderful addition to my collection. Thank you very much, and now let's talk about the reward. Here's your 2,000 gold pieces, as agreed.~ /*Well, the Tome of Fire! That will be a nice addition to my collection. Thank you very much, and now for your reward.*/
@23 = ~NP: Yeah, Tom Ice. Another fine piece of work to add to my collection. Thank you for that. Now let's talk about the reward. Here's your 2,000 gold pieces, as agreed.~ /*Ah, the Tome of Ice. Another fine work to add to my collection. I thank you for this.*/
@24 = ~NP: Oh, this is one delightful book I'd love to review, I suppose. That's the one that really gets me excited. And for you.... Here's your 2,000 gold pieces, as agreed.~ /*Oh, this shall be an exciting tome to page through, I would say. This makes me happy indeed. And for you...*/
@25 = ~NP: Ah, what an exceptional book. I always thought death was such a strange, misunderstood thing. This book will serve as the centerpiece of my collection. I trust you'll be quite pleased with the reward, here's your 2,000 gold pieces as agreed.~ /*Well, what an exquisite book. I've always thought death was such a beautiful, misunderstood thing. This book shall serve as my center piece.*/
@26 = ~NP: Well, well, Tom Resonance. Though I hoped for the best, I was sure I would never see it in my library. You have my admiration - and my gratitude. I trust you will be quite pleased with the reward. Here's your 2,000 gold pieces, as agreed.~ /*Well, well, the Tome of Resonance. Though I hoped otherwise, I felt certain I would never see it amongst my collection. You have my admiration, and appreciation.*/
@27 = ~Well, that's more than fair. If you want anything for that tome, however, just come back to me.~
@28 = ~What kind of wares do you sell here?~
@29 = ~Yes, I have heard something. A knight - was it Sir Karathis? He was looking for someone to help him slay a werewolf, I think. To be honest, that may have happened a few days ago or more; I pay little attention to such things. Is there something else?~ /*To be honest, that may have happened a few days ago or more; I pay little attention to such things. Is there something else?*/
@30 = ~Can you remind me about that tome-recovery job?~
@31 = ~Well, well, well. I do indeed have a task for you. How do you feel about recovering some old tomes for me?~
@32 = ~Good. Tell me more.~
@33 = ~What are these tomes? What do they do?~
@34 = ~Not interested, but I have another question.~
@35 = ~Well, I'm sure you can find someone else to help you out there... Unless you're looking to know where I keep a chair or somesuch.~
@36 = ~NP: Ah, really, how wonderful it is! Ah, what exceptional books. These books will serve as the centerpiece of my collection. I trust you will be quite pleased with the reward. Here's your 10,000 gold pieces, and I'll add a magical artifact to it. It's a very rare item.~ /*<CHARNAME>, you never fail to surprise me. There is a great market for such things in Thay. I could offer you 700 gold, or an interesting magic item I recently acquired.*/

@38 = ~I could have sworn I told you about a job already, and that you agreed to do it. Do you want a refresher?~
@39 = ~Yes, I think that would help.~
@40 = ~NP: The Five Volumes of Ancient Imaskar are somewhere in this area in fragmented form. I want you to find these volumes and return them to me. If you can do that, I will give you far more than the books are worth. You can be sure of that. The five books I'm asking you to find are the volumes of Resonance, Life, Death, Ice and Fire. I will pay you 2000 gold for each book, and if you bring all five books, I will add an excellent magic item to the reward.~ /*Scattered about the region are the Five Tomes of Ancient Imaskar. I want you to find these tomes, and return them here to me.*/
@41 = ~Where could the Tome of Fire be?~
@42 = ~Do you know where the Tome of Ice is?~
@43 = ~I need more information about the Tome of Life.~
@44 = ~NP: Where can I find Tom of Death?~ /*Where me find Tome of Death?*/
@45 = ~Do you know where the Tome of Resonance is?~
@46 = ~NP: I'll get you those books.~ /*I will look into it.*/
@47 = ~This does not interest me. Goodbye.~ /*I'm not interested. Goodbye.*/
@48 = ~NP: The simplest and shortest explanation I can come up with is that these tomes are like cookbooks. They contain recipes for creating magical items. I can offer a decent reward for these books.~ /*The best way that I can explain their purpose, with brevity, is to compare them to recipe books. These books explain the crafting of magical items.*/
@49 = ~NP: Very good. I'll look forward to it.~ /*Very well. I shall return.*/

@51 = ~The Tome of Fire has been a tricky one for me to locate. My scrying attempts reveal that it is far to the south, but I cannot see where specifically. It would make sense that the tome was within the Charwood. Though I know not why, that realm resists my scrying. If it were anywhere else, I think I could locate it.~ /*It would make sense that the tome was within the Charwood. Though I know not why, that realm resists my scrying. If it were anywhere else, I think I could locate it.*/
@52 = ~Near here but to the south, you'll find a tower. Within that tower, you shall find the Tome of Ice. Of course, the owner of the tower is a powerful wizard in his own right, and you should be cautious in your approach.~ /*Of course, the owner of the tower is a powerful wizard in his own right, and you should be cautious in your approach.*/
@53 = ~This tome was in the possession of Brother Toras, a member of the Arcane Brotherhood. I had planned to buy it from him, but he died before I had the chance. I checked around when I heard he was dead, but it wasn't amongst his personal possessions. The only place I haven't searched yet is his tomb; I simply haven't had the time.~ /*I checked around when I heard he was dead, but it wasn't amongst his personal possessions. The only place I haven't searched yet is his tomb; I simply haven't had the time.*/
@54 = ~Who is the Arcane Brotherhood?~
@55 = ~Where is his tomb?~
@56 = ~Like the Tome of Fire, my scrying tells me that the Tome of Death has followed the long, dark road into the Charwood. If only I could see more, but the region is impervious to my efforts.~ /*Like the Tome of Fire, my scrying tells me that the Tome of Death has followed the long, dark road into the Charwood.*/
@57 = ~My scrying has shown that it was originally taken east into the Neverwinter Woods. Perhaps if you go to the Neverwinter Woods, a clue or two will reveal itself.~ /*My scrying has shown that it was originally taken east into the Neverwinter Woods.*/
@58 = ~That's all I needed to know. Goodbye.~ /*That's all I need to know about the prison.*/
@59 = ~Come now, you can't be serious. You don't know of the Arcane Brotherhood? They are located in Luskan, and they are the true power in that city. Their ruthless tactics are infamous, and the only thing that has stopped them from major expansion is the constant in-fighting and bickering they do.~ /*Their ruthless tactics are infamous, and the only thing that has stopped them from major expansion is the constant in-fighting and bickering they do.*/
@60 = ~Being wealthy and powerful, I would imagine he had his own mausoleum outside the city walls of Luskan. Just be careful. Brother Toras was a powerful wizard and might have some deadly traps or guardians protecting his tomb from grave robbers.~ /*Just be careful. Brother Toras was a powerful wizard and might have some deadly traps or guardians protecting his tomb from grave robbers.*/
@61 = ~NP: Ah, Tom of Fire! This will be a wonderful addition to my collection. Thank you so much, now I have all the books and can talk about the reward. I believe you'll be quite pleased with that. Here is your 2,000 gold pieces, and to it I will add a magical artifact. It's a very rare item.~ /*Well, the Tome of Fire! That will be a nice addition to my collection. Thank you very much, and now for your reward.*/
@62 = ~NP: Yeah, Tom Ice. Another fine piece of work to add to my collection. Thank you for this, now I have all the books and can talk about the reward. I trust you'll be quite pleased with that. Here's your 2,000 gold pieces, and I'll add a magical artifact to it. It's a very rare item.~ /*Ah, the Tome of Ice. Another fine work to add to my collection. I thank you for this.*/
@63 = ~NP: Oh, now that's a delightful book I'd love to review, I suppose. That's what I'm really excited about. Now I have all the books and can talk about the award. I believe you'll be quite pleased with that. Here's your 2000 gold pieces, and I'll add a magical artifact to it. It's a very rare item.~ /*Oh, this shall be an exciting tome to page through, I would say. This makes me happy indeed. And for you...*/
@64 = ~NP: Ah, what an exceptional book. I always thought death was such a strange, misunderstood thing. This book will serve as the centerpiece of my collection. Now I have all the books, we can talk about the reward. I believe you'll be quite happy with that. Here's your 2000 gold pieces, and I'll add a magical artifact to it. It's a very rare item.~ /*Well, what an exquisite book. I've always thought death was such a beautiful, misunderstood thing. This book shall serve as my center piece.*/
@65 = ~NP: Well, well, Tom Resonance. Though I hoped for the best, I was sure I would never see it in my library. I express my admiration - and appreciation. Now I have all the books and can talk about the reward. I believe you'll be quite pleased with that. Here's your 2,000 gold pieces, and I'll add a magical artifact to it. It's a very rare item.~ /*Well, well, the Tome of Resonance. Though I hoped otherwise, I felt certain I would never see it amongst my collection. You have my admiration, and appreciation.*/
@66 = ~Well, hello. Have you exciting news for me, or is this just a routine visit? Either way, I'm pleased to see you again.~ [NWELT054]
@67 = ~What would I have exciting news about?~
@68 = ~Can you remind me about that job?~
@69 = ~Why, the tomes of course! Have you found any? You do remember agreeing to look for me, don't you? I still remember offering a lot of gold for their return.~
