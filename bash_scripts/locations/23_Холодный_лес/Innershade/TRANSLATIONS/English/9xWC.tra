@0    = ~Ah, it's you. I saw you entering Innershade. I'm Strongheart, the wood-chopper. We don't have many visitors, so I'm sorry if I sound a bit harsh to you. Do you need something? To be honest, I have nothing to offer.~
@1    = ~Well, I just wanted to know the villagers a bit. That's all.~
@2    = ~You look troubled. Did something happen?~
@3    = ~Just looking around. Can you tell me something about this village?~
@4    = ~Whatever. I have to go. Do whatever you were doing before I came.~
@5    = ~Why so? Well, that's probably your business. You don't have to answer that. You have your reason, and even if you don't, it doesn't matter for me.~
@6    = ~You already know me. I'm a simple man who works to make a living. Would that be enough? I have some problems of my own, so if that's all, I'd like to focus on more... important things, young one.~
@7    = ~Exactly what kinds of problems are you talking about? I may be able to help.~
@8    = ~That's all. Well, I know where to find you if I need something. Goodbye.~
@9    = ~I'd like to know something more about this village. Please tell me something about Innershade.~
@10   = ~I'm a fair man, and I like to solve my problems on my own. I don't like to trouble other people with insignificant things.~
@11   = ~But I have nothing to do. Just let me help you. A fair man should have some quality time for himself from time to time. Rest a while, have a pint, or focus on something creative. While you do that, I can solve one of your problems.~
@12   = ~I understand you. Sometimes a man has to do something on his own strength. I'll try not to bother you with such things anymore, but may I ask you about something else?~
@13   = ~Whatever. I have to go.~
@14   = ~Maybe you're right. I have to clean my dagger, all covered in boar blood. I don't want it to get rusty.~
@15   = ~You see, my tools were ruined in a storm we had some time ago. I fixed some of them, but I still don't have an axe with which I could chop wood. What's more, I can't talk to Eva the blacksmith. She's really edgy. You know... women are like that... from time to time. You probably understand.~
@16   = ~So, would you bring me a fine axe? By fine, I don't mean magical. I'm a simple wood-chopper. I just want it to be in one piece.~
@17   = ~Well, I can do that. I'll look for an axe for you, Strongheart.~
@18   = ~I thought you'd have bigger problems... I won't waste my time for such petty issues. Goodbye.~
@19   = ~Thank you. I'll wait here.~
@20   = ~Ask.~
@21   = ~Can you tell me something about Innershade?~
@22   = ~Oh, would you look at the time? I have to go. Bye!~
@23   = ~Well, that wasn't a very specific question. What exactly you would like to know?~
@24   = ~Are there many villagers here?~
@25   = ~I haven't seen this place on any map. It's not a very old village, is it?~
@26   = ~Where I can find this place's leader?~
@27   = ~Where I can buy some weapons and armor?~
@28   = ~Well, I don't think I have any more questions for now. It's time for me to go.~
@29   = ~No. I'd say about twenty-seven. We'e a rather small community; some people leave this village, but also some join us... but we never had more than forty villagers, including myself.~
@30   = ~Mhm. But it's not a very old village, is it?~
@31   = ~Where I can find this place's leader?~
@32   = ~Can I buy any weapons or armor in this place?~
@33   = ~It's time for me to go.~
@34   = ~It's been here a few years. Three, maybe four. This place isn't significant enough to be marked on maps. What we can offer though... we have a little mine, some trees, and a not-so-famous blacksmith... that would be all.~
@35   = ~Our leader? Well, I wouldn't call Dawnmaster Patric a leader, but he cares for all of us. You can find him in a little tower west of here.~
@36   = ~Talk to Eva, our blacksmith. You can find her toward the northwest of our village. She shouldn't be very busy right now, but she's a bit of an edgy person, so watch out when speaking to her.~
@37   = ~All right, then. I also have some things to do. Good luck in your adventures.~
@38   = ~Ah, it's you again. Do you need something?~
@39   = ~I have an axe for you, my friend.~
@40   = ~I have an axe for you, my friend. I bought you an enchanted one. It'll serve you better.~
@41   = ~I see bruises on your face... Was Eva here? Well, to be honest, I told her that I had killed you.~
@42   = ~Ah, yes, you have it. Well, you were right. I should just agree. Eva wouldn't have sold me an axe, and even if she did, I'd have to pay a ridiculous amount of gold. I know her well. When she's angry at someone, she really knows how to show it.~
@43   = ~But I have no idea what kind of reward I can give you. I'm not a rich person, and I won't give you any wood. Now, that would be ridiculous.~
@44   = ~Just give me some money. Thatll be fine.~
@45   = ~I don't need any reward. I am glad I was able to help such a fair man.~
@46   = ~Ah, it's nothing. Let's say it's a gift.~
@47   = ~Really? Well, that's marvelous! Well, you were right. I should just agree. Eva would't have sold me an axe, and even if she did, I would have to pay a ridiculous amount of gold. I know her well. When she's angry at someone, she really knows how to show it.~
@48   = ~But I have no idea what kind of reward I can give you. I'm not a rich person, and I won't give you a wood. Now, that would be ridiculous. (He appears troubled.)~
@49   = ~I can give you only these hundred gold coins. I'm sorry, but that's all.~
@50   = ~Fine, them. Give me the money. I have to go.~
@51   = ~I changed my mind. Take the axe. It's a gift.~
@52   = ~Here, take it. I have to get back to work. We'll probably meet again.~
@53   = ~Thank you. You're most generous, my friend. You really saved me. It would've taken me a month to persuade Eva to sell me an axe at the standard price. I won't say a single bad word about you.~
@54   = ~So, that's what happened... Heh, she was furious, still... I have to say she's not so bad... You know, there was a misunderstanding between us a long time ago. She thought I wanted to see her from time to time, only because I wanted to sleep with her. It wasn't true. Just... She's like that, but I think that'll change.~
@55   = ~This is probably going to be a new beginning. Thank you. If you want to see Eva, she's probably back in her home.~
