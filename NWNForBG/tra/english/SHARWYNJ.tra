@0 = ~NP: Yes,<SIRMAAM> . Do you need something?~ [SHARWY50] /*Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Is there something you need?*/
@1 = ~I just want to talk for a while.~
@2 = ~Nothing, I'm all right.~
@3 = ~Talk? About what, <CHARNAME>?~
@4 = ~I'd like to know more about you.~
@5 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@6 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@7 = ~Do you have any advice you can give me about my mission?~
@8 = ~As you wish. We should probably continue with your mission in any case.~
@9 = ~NP: Do you want to know more about me? Fine,<CHARNAME> I love to chat. But I would like to ask you something first. Why did you take on this mission? Why are you even working for Aribeth? Has she bewitched you with her elven eyelashes, or is there some other force at work here, unknown to me?~ /*Why are you on this mission of yours? Why work for Aribeth at all? Did she bat her pretty elven eyelashes at you, or is there some other force at work here that I'm unaware of?*/
@10 = ~Why do you want to know? I asked first.~
@11 = ~I cannot idly stand by while people suffer and die.~
@12 = ~In times of darkness great heroes must do great deeds. It is how legends are forged.~
@13 = ~Aribeth has promised me gold and riches if I can help her in this.~
@14 = ~So you did. I expect to be answered first before I say anything. Does that bother you?~
@15 = ~I suppose that is a fair motivation. I feel the same, to tell the truth, although I desire more out of all this than just mere success.~
@16 = ~Now you are are talking my language, <CHARNAME>. Making a name for ourselves by doing great things is what being an adventurer is truly all about, isn't it?~
@17 = ~Is that all there is to it? Wealth and power? Are you sure? There are many other ways to become rich other than performing great deeds, you know. Surely you must have chosen this way for some reason.~
@18 = ~NP: More than anything, I need fame. I want to walk a path that no one has walked before me. I want to have my own legend, not a century for me to tell strangers. I want to admire my own life and, looking back, regret nothing. This may seem small to you. But I have my own motives and I'm not waiting for anyone's approval. What do you say<CHARNAME> ? Can I achieve all this while traveling with you?~ /*I desire fame above all else. I want to walk the path that others haven't, to make my own legend rather than recount others'. I want to be thrilled and awed by my life, and when I look back on it to regret nothing.*/
@19 = ~Absolutely, Sharwyn. Stick with me and you'll be famous.~
@20 = ~Forget about that. We have more important matters to attend to.~
@21 = ~Who knows what might happen, Sharwyn?~
@22 = ~Promises, promises. I'll admit that there's something about your future that holds great possibility, however. We'll see where it leads.~
@23 = ~You are the one who asked, <CHARNAME>. No matter how you might disapprove of what I think, however, your mission holds great possibility for me.~
@24 = ~True enough. Adventure can lead to death or obscurity... one can never tell for sure.~
@25 = ~NP: I think it's better to try. Indeed, it is better to perform feats and remain unknown than not to try at all. I already know where the &quot;usual&quot; path leads, believe me ... the path of the expected, the path that everyone advises you around. At the end of such a path lies oblivion.~ /*I know where the 'normal' path leads, believe me... the path of the expected, the path that everyone else wants you to lead. Down that path lies oblivion.*/
@26 = ~Oblivion? What are you talking about?~
@27 = ~No need to be so melodramatic about it.~
@28 = ~I agree.~
@29 = ~Death, <CHARNAME>... or as good as it, anyway. There are many ways to die that don't leave a corpse.~
@30 = ~I do not exaggerate, <CHARNAME>. I know what I speak of well enough. There are many ways to die that don't leave a corpse... whether you agree with me or not.~
@31 = ~You do? Yes, I'd expect your life is just about as far from normal as one can walk, isn't it? You understand whereof I speak.~
@32 = ~NP: If you want, I'll tell you a story sometime... about my family and how I got to where I am. Most likely, you will be bored to death, I'm not the subject of a legend ... but that's up to you.~ /*If you wish, I'll tell you a tale, sometime... about my family, and how I became what I am today.*/
@33 = ~Tell me now.~
@34 = ~Sure, another time.~
@35 = ~I don't want to hear your stories, I'm sure.~
@36 = ~NP: No... I'm not in the mood to tell you this story right now. Legends and tales - please ... but I can tell stories about myself only in the right mood. I'm sure we have something to do, right? Lead me,<CHARNAME> .~ /*No... I'm not in the mood to tell you that tale just yet. Of legends and fairy tales, certainly... but I only tell stories about myself when I'm ready.*/
@37 = ~Fair enough. Let's get back to your escapade, shall we?~
@38 = ~Well, that's entirely up to you. We need not speak at all, if you don't wish to, correct?~
@39 = ~NP: It seems I myself suggested that you tell me about my family? Well then<CHARNAME> , I will tell you. By my family, I actually mean my mother. This is my only real family I have ever known. I never saw my father... She and my mother broke up before I was born.~ /*By my family, I actually mean my mother. She's the only true family I've ever known. I never met my father... he and my mother parted ways before I was born.*/
@40 = ~Mother was an adventurer, you see... a mage, in fact, of some skill. This is what other people have told me, however, as Mother would never discuss it. She left that life behind, along with my father, to marry a man of wealth.~
@41 = ~Why would she do that?~
@42 = ~You don't sound as if you approve.~
@43 = ~She had sense, obviously.~
@44 = ~NP: As I said, my mother did not share her memories with me. She had more important things to do than any adventurous 'nonsense'. My mother needed wealth. She needed decorations, outings and luxurious mansions in the Black Lake region. And her husband was her instrument. She left magic and instead took up spending money. She spent far more money than my stepfather could afford. And as long as he provided her with finances, she did not want to hear about his complaints.~ /*She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money. Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn't care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.*/
@45 = ~NP: Maybe not now, but then I did not know otherwise. Mother considered her past 'nonsense' and had more important things on her mind. My mother needed wealth. She needed decorations, outings and luxurious mansions in the Black Lake region. And her husband was her instrument. She left magic and instead took up spending money. She spent far more money than my stepfather could afford. And as long as he provided her with finances, she did not want to hear about his complaints.~ /*She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money. Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn't care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.*/
@46 = ~NP: Oh yes, of course. My mother was very focused on sanity and considered only one worthy of attention. My mother needed wealth. She needed decorations, outings and luxurious mansions in the Black Lake region. And her husband was her instrument. She left magic and instead took up spending money. She spent far more money than my stepfather could afford. And as long as he provided her with finances, she did not want to hear about his complaints.~ /*She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money. Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn't care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.*/
@47 = ~When he died unexpectedly, she was devastated. Not because he was gone, but because he left behind a mountain of debts. She was terrified at the thought of being poor.~
@48 = ~What about you? Were you saddened by his death?~
@49 = ~She sounds like a terrible woman.~
@50 = ~So she returned to her magic?~
@51 = ~NP: To be honest, I never really knew my stepfather. My mother kept me at a distance all the time, transferring me from one private school to another. She prepared a desperate plan. When I was little, we hardly saw each other, but now she had a need for me ... I was already approaching the age when girls get married, and she saw me married to a rich bachelor.~ /*She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.*/
@52 = ~NP: Terrible? May be. However, as soon as you enter this life full of wealth and luxury, it becomes difficult for you to believe that there is anything beyond it. She prepared a desperate plan. When I was little, we hardly saw each other, but now she had a need for me ... I was already approaching the age when girls get married, and she saw me married to a rich bachelor.~ /*She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.*/
@53 = ~NP: Of course no. My mother forgot about it after a while. As soon as you enter into a life full of wealth, it becomes difficult for you to believe that there is anything beyond it. She prepared a desperate plan. When I was little, we hardly saw each other, but now she had a need for me ... I was already approaching the age when girls get married, and she saw me married to a rich bachelor.~ /*She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.*/
@54 = ~NP: Not for my benefit, of course, but for my own. I was a meek girl and used to obey my mother in everything, so I could not even think to object. My mother has her eye on young Lord Farthingdon. He would never stoop to marrying a poor noblewoman, but only...if he didn't want me. I had to seduce him.~ /*My mother had her eye on the young Lord Farthingdon. He would never stoop to marry poor nobility, however... not unless he desired me. I would have to seduce him.*/
@55 = ~NP: I was about to. I went to Lord Farthingdon's estate to a party in his honor, where my mother wanted us to meet. When we arrived, I was struck by the size of the hall. There were so many people there and they were all dancing. I could hardly perceive everything around ... and the music was incomparable. I stepped on the floor and walked over to the person my mother had pointed out to me. I was very worried, but the man was very handsome, kind and smart. I immediately fell in love with him.~ /*When we arrived, I was awestruck at the size of the hall. There were so many people dancing I could barely take it all in... and the music was so beautiful.*/
@56 = ~My mother grabbed me away from him angrily not long later. I had mistaken her directions... it was not Lord Farthingdon I had danced with, after all. It was far too late for my heart, however.~
@57 = ~You must have felt foolish.~
@58 = ~I take it your mother wasn't happy about that?~
@59 = ~Who was this man, then?~
@60 = ~My mother thought I should have, obviously. She scolded me soundly. I was in complete bliss, however. I couldn't stop thinking about that man.~
@61 = ~She was furious, naturally, since I never got to meet Lord Farthingdon. She was even worse when it was discovered who I had met.~
@62 = ~NP: His name was Dannen... a poor bard who served under Lord Farthingdon. And I fell madly in love with him. My mother ordered me to forget about him. But I couldn't, despite the fact that we could lose everything.~ /*His name was Dannen... a penniless apprentice bard in the service of Lord Farthingdon. I was utterly in love with him.*/
@63 = ~That was selfish of you.~
@64 = ~Love can do that.~
@65 = ~Then what happened?~
@66 = ~You sound like my mother. Our fate rested on my shoulders, she said... it was all on me, and I had a duty to attend to.~
@67 = ~I was young and blind and hopeless. I fell for the first man who showed interest in me... not that my mother intended for that to stop us.~
@68 = ~NP: I had a choice, of course. Take the path mother wanted and seduce Lord Farthingdon. Or run away with a beggar bard. I had to do it one way or another. But in the end, I got it all wrong. Silly girl, I did what was expected of me. The rest I will tell some other time, perhaps. Let's take care of your business.~ /*I had a choice, obviously. Take the path I was expected to and seduce Lord Farthingdon. Or run off with the penniless bard.*/
@69 = ~NP: Do you want to hear the continuation of the story of my failed romance? I don't think it will do any harm. I should have run away with Dannen... or left him. I did neither one nor the other - I did not want a quarrel with my mother. Instead, I seduced Lord Farthingdon as she wished... and continued to secretly love my bard.~ /*I should have run off with Dannen... or turned him aside completely. I did neither, as I was unwilling to disobey my mother. Instead, I seduced Lord Farthingdon as she wished... and loved my bard in secret.*/
@70 = ~Dannen was kind to me. He enthralled me with his music and I adored him. Lord Farthingdon, on the other hand, was merely lustful and possessive... and my mother was overjoyed.~
@71 = ~This couldn't have gone on long.~
@72 = ~Why didn't you simply make a decision?~
@73 = ~People act like idiots when they're in love.~
@74 = ~NP: No, its true. Such a story can only have a bad ending, of course, and I wish I had known that back then. The date of my wedding to Lord Farthingdon was approaching, and he began to suspect that something was missing. I spent too much time away from him, in Dannen's arms. My mother did everything she could to convince him that I was faithful to him... and it was my mother who finally caught me in the arms of my bard.~ /*As the date of my marriage to Lord Farthingdon grew closer, he began to suspect that something was amiss. I spent far too much time away from him and in Dannen's arms.*/
@75 = ~So did she have Dannen killed?~
@76 = ~NP: Well, did you kill your mother?~ /*So you killed her?*/
@77 = ~An unpleasant scene, I would bet.~
@78 = ~NP: So far, it was easiest to give everyone what they wanted. Lord Farthingdon wanted a wife, my mother wanted me in marriage, and Dannen wanted to love me. The date of my wedding to Lord Farthingdon was approaching, and he began to suspect that something was missing. I spent too much time away from him, in Dannen's arms. My mother did everything she could to convince him that I was faithful to him... and it was my mother who finally caught me in the arms of my bard.~ /*As the date of my marriage to Lord Farthingdon grew closer, he began to suspect that something was amiss. I spent far too much time away from him and in Dannen's arms.*/
@79 = ~NP: This is true. In fact, I can bet that the meanest deeds have always been done in the name of love. The date of my wedding to Lord Farthingdon was approaching, and he began to suspect that something was missing. I spent too much time away from him, in Dannen's arms. My mother did everything she could to convince him that I was faithful to him... and it was my mother who finally caught me in the arms of my bard.~ /*As the date of my marriage to Lord Farthingdon grew closer, he began to suspect that something was amiss. I spent far too much time away from him and in Dannen's arms.*/
@80 = ~NP: She ordered the guards to drive him away, but they failed to kill him. And that didn't stop me from continuing to love him. Then my mother turned on me and forbade me to ever see Dannen. I was to be married to Lord Farthingdon, and there was nothing to be done about it. At first I refused. I loved Dannen and nothing else made sense to me. And she began to beg me ... this proud woman knelt down and with tears in her eyes begged not to leave her in poverty.~ /*I refused, at first. I loved Dannen and nothing else mattered. So she begged me... that proud woman got on her knees with tears in her eyes and begged me not to abandon her to poverty.*/
@81 = ~NP: Of course not. She was my mother, after all. She lowered the guards on Dannen, but he managed to escape ... and in her annoyance, I still loved him. Then my mother turned on me and forbade me to ever see Dannen. I was to be married to Lord Farthingdon, and there was nothing to be done about it. At first I refused. I loved Dannen and nothing else made sense to me. And she began to beg me ... this proud woman knelt down and with tears in her eyes begged not to leave her in poverty.~ /*I refused, at first. I loved Dannen and nothing else mattered. So she begged me... that proud woman got on her knees with tears in her eyes and begged me not to abandon her to poverty.*/
@82 = ~NP: Well, that's putting it mildly. My mother was furious and sent guards to kill Dannen. But fortunately he ran, and I was calm for him. Then my mother turned on me and forbade me to ever see Dannen. I was to be married to Lord Farthingdon, and there was nothing to be done about it. At first I refused. I loved Dannen and nothing else made sense to me. And she began to beg me ... this proud woman knelt down and with tears in her eyes begged not to leave her in poverty.~ /*I refused, at first. I loved Dannen and nothing else mattered. So she begged me... that proud woman got on her knees with tears in her eyes and begged me not to abandon her to poverty.*/
@83 = ~I could do as I was expected: save my mother and marry a man whom I did not love... or I could run off into the unknown with Dannen.~
@84 = ~You chose Dannen?~
@85 = ~You chose Lord Farthingdon?~
@86 = ~NP: I could not make up my mind, because I had never before had to make decisions ... but the thought of the sad fate with Lord Farthingdon frightened me. And I chose Dannen. Lord Farthingdon was beside himself with rage. He tried to execute me and Dannen, and we had to run penniless for our souls.~ /*I struggled with the decision, for I had never had to make up my own mind... but the thought of that dreary life with Lord Farthingdon frightened me so. I chose Dannen.*/
@87 = ~My mother was crushed. She was turned out from noble society as she feared, and lost everything to repay my step-father's debt.~
@88 = ~What did you do then?~
@89 = ~How could you do that to your mother?~
@90 = ~You did the only thing you could.~
@91 = ~NP: Dannen and I fled Neverwinter and traveled to distant lands. He taught me the art of bards, and I didn't return home for many years...until recently. It was a strange feeling when I learned that Lord Farthingdon lost his fortune many years ago and he and his family died of the plague. Such a fate awaited me. And my mother... I've only visited her once since my return.~ /*It was an odd feeling to discover that Lord Farthingdon had lost his own fortune years ago and both he and his household were now dead from the plague. That was the fate that had awaited me.*/
@92 = ~She still lives?~
@93 = ~How could I not do it? My mother had ruled me for all of my life... but this one thing I could not do for her. It was not easy to do, however.~
@94 = ~I still dreaded the thought of leaving my mother behind. I would have done anything to please her... but not this one thing. I would not give up my life.~
@95 = ~NP: All these years she lived in poverty, working as a seamstress. She blamed me for her lack of luck. We talked quite a bit before she ordered me to leave her shabby little house. But I still managed to find out something: she is dying. She is ill with rotten bone... a disease that can only be cured by the careful care of a few healers. But there is a plague here, and no one will save it ... I tried to find at least someone, but in vain.~ /*She suffers from bonerot... a disease which would require the attention of several clerics for a month to heal normally. With the plague, however, no one can help her... though I have tried in vain to find one who can.*/
@96 = ~Why would you even want her healed?~
@97 = ~Is there nothing that can be done?~
@98 = ~Perhaps I could help her.~
@99 = ~NP: I... don't know, honestly. I don't feel the need to forgive her, but I'm not angry with her either. My mother is who she is. I know of only one sure remedy for rotten bone... the extract of a flower that grows only on the magical cliffs of Mount Celestia. I have no doubt that such a drug is very difficult to find. But I hope to find him and save my mother's life. Not that I owe her, but I... wish I could do this for her now.~ /*Finding such a potion would be difficult, I have no doubt. It is my hope to find one, however, and save my mother's life. I do not owe her, really, but I... would like to do this one thing for her, now.*/
@100 = ~Is this the potion you're talking about?~
@101 = ~Perhaps we shall find it on our travels.~
@102 = ~As long as you don't let your search interfere with your service to me!~
@103 = ~NP: I know of only one sure remedy for rotten bone... the extract of a flower that grows only on the magical cliffs of Mount Celestia. I have no doubt that such a drug is very difficult to find. But I hope to find him and save my mother's life. Not that I owe her, but I... wish I could do it for her now.~ /*Finding such a potion would be difficult, I have no doubt. It is my hope to find one, however, and save my mother's life. I do not owe her, really, but I... would like to do this one thing for her, now.*/
@104 = ~NP: May be,<CHARNAME> ... it wouldn't take long... I know of only one sure remedy for rotten bone... the extract of a flower that only grows on the magical cliffs of Mount Celestia. I have no doubt that such a drug is very difficult to find. But I hope to find him and save my mother's life. Not that I owe her, but I... wish I could do it for her now.~ /*Finding such a potion would be difficult, I have no doubt. It is my hope to find one, however, and save my mother's life. I do not owe her, really, but I... would like to do this one thing for her, now.*/
@105 = ~NP: It's... Yes, that's it. How strange to come across something that comes from a different plane, but...well, I won't question it. Thank you,<CHARNAME> . I will send this to my mother as soon as I can. Thanks to you, I'm better. Here, take this. This belt belonged to Dannen, I kept it. I want you to have it... I hope it serves you well.~ /*It... it is, indeed. How you came across something that can only be made on another plane, however... well, I won't question it.*/
@106 = ~Thank you, Sharwyn.~
@107 = ~That's it? Some cheap belt?~
@108 = ~Perhaps we will, though I doubt it. Let's get on with your mission, <CHARNAME>... there are others who are sick whom we are far more likely to save.~
@109 = ~To be honest, I do not have my hopes up. There are far more sick folk whom we are more likely to save... let us continue.~
@110 = ~I am not very used to kindness from others, <CHARNAME>. I will not forget this. Let us... just proceed with your mission, now.~
@111 = ~NP: It doesn't look very good, but Dannen told me that this belt is from a strange place and has great power. I'm not used to the kindness of others,<CHARNAME> . I won't forget this. Come on... now just continue your mission.~ /*I am not very used to kindness from others, <CHARNAME>. I will not forget this. Let us... just proceed with your mission, now.*/
@112 = ~There is no more to the story, <CHARNAME>. My mother is dying. I hope to find the potion she needs and save her life... it is just something I have to do.~
@113 = ~I'd prefer not to, right now. We have more important things to do, I'm sure.~
@114 = ~NP: You neglected things that are important to me, I don't want to talk about it anymore.~ /*Let us return to the topic of your mission, and speak of this no more.*/
@115 = ~I wouldn't know where to begin. I suppose I could tell you something about Blacklake, if you like... I know that best.~
@116 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@117 = ~NP: Then I have no questions.~ /*That's all the questions I have.*/
@118 = ~Not really. You're a grown <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I'm sure you can handle yourself and even lead little old me, no?~
@119 = ~NP: Great. There are crowds of rich, frightened nobles at every turn, who would rather fence off their area and pretend that the rest of the city simply does not exist than try to somehow help. There are those in the area who beg the rich to help the rest of the city, but their cries are directed to the deaf. Someday the plague will come to the rich, and then they will regret their selfishness.~ /*Plenty. It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist than actually try to help.*/
@120 = ~There is one powerful nobleman by the name of Meldanen... he's a sorcerer with a fearsome reputation who lives in Blacklake. If anyone might, he might know something about what's going on.~
@121 = ~Anything else?~
@122 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~
@123 = ~NP: What else is there to say? This is perhaps the only place in the city that is almost not affected by plague and unrest, although it will not be easy to penetrate its walls. Perhaps there are some rough edges... in any place where there are rich people, you will find a place where they indulge their strange whims. Presumably, the local tavern also has a basement with special ... entertainment. hmmm. That's all that comes to my mind, to be honest.~ /*There are some elements of seediness, perhaps... every place you find the rich, you find places where they can indulge their strangest tastes. I understand the local tavern's basement has its... distractions.*/
@124 = ~Very well, then, let's get back to your mission.~
@125 = ~My strength is in weapons not words, <CHARNAME>.~
@126 = ~If we're to be companions I'd like to know a little more about you.~
@127 = ~I'd like you to continue your story from before, Sharwyn.~
@128 = ~Mine is no great tale, <CHARNAME>. If you like, I could tell you of my beginnings as a bard.~
@129 = ~Yes, tell me about that.~
@130 = ~Haven't you got anything more interesting?~
@131 = ~How about telling me how you became so beautiful?~
@132 = ~Some other time then.~
@133 = ~NP: Well. I learned the basics from Dannen, my partner and lover. He was the one who took me away from Neverwinter, away from my family. We were one team, a duo, making money in taverns with songs, traveling from city to city along the entire Sword Coast. We camped along the roads, and I listened with admiration as Dannen told me old legends by the firelight. Every night I loved him more and more.~ /*We would camp off the roads and I would listen in awe as Dannen told me the old legends by the firelight. I loved him more as each night passed.*/
@134 = ~So why aren't you with him now?~
@135 = ~Gah. You didn't tell me this was some awful love story.~
@136 = ~It couldn't have all been so idyllic.~
@137 = ~I could tell you all manner of legends and fables, <CHARNAME>. I save that talk for the taverns where I can be properly paid.~
@138 = ~I could pay you.~
@139 = ~Fine, tell me your story, then.~
@140 = ~Is that your clumsy way of saying you like the way I look?~
@141 = ~NP: What's awkward about that?~ /*What's so clumsy about it?*/
@142 = ~I like more than just how you look, Sharwyn.~
@143 = ~I don't mean to offend you.~
@144 = ~NP: Great question. At that time, it seemed to me that nothing could separate us. He was my first, you know, and my faith in our love was so absolute. As it turns out, those were the best times. I should have been more careful about them then, because soon everything changed for the worse. It all started when we were walking along the southern part of Amn. We received a rather unexpected and urgent invitation to sing in front of one of the richest courts in Atkatla.~ /*An excellent question. At the time, I didn't think anything could separate us. He was my first, you see, and my belief in our love was absolute.*/
@145 = ~This was bad news?~
@146 = ~NP: Even the most beautiful love stories hide tragedy and pain. Of course, I didn't expect this... my faith in my young love was absolute. As it turns out, those were the best times. I should have been more careful about them then, because soon everything changed for the worse. It all started when we were walking along the southern part of Amn. We received a rather unexpected and urgent invitation to sing in front of one of the wealthiest courts in Atkatla.~ /*The fateful day came when we crossed into Amn in the south. We received a rather sudden and unexpected invitation to sing before one of the wealthiest courts in Athkatla.*/
@147 = ~NP: Oh, there were many obstacles we faced. Disgusting weather, brigands... all sorts of disasters. But we were still together. As it turns out, those were the best times. I should have been more careful about them then, because soon everything changed for the worse. It all started when we were walking along the southern part of Amn. We received a rather unexpected and urgent invitation to sing in front of one of the wealthiest courts in Askatla.~ /*The fateful day came when we crossed into Amn in the south. We received a rather sudden and unexpected invitation to sing before one of the wealthiest courts in Athkatla.*/
@148 = ~No thanks. I prefer a larger audience for that sort of thing. Also, I am not here to keep you entertained, <CHARNAME>.~
@149 = ~You're cute, <CHARNAME>... I'll give you that much. Now do you want to hear my story or not?~
@150 = ~NP: Well... Dannen accepted the invitation and said that our performances in taverns finally got someone's attention and this is our reward. He was very happy. As for me, I doubted. I was not so sure of our talents, and it was natural to ask the question about the motives for such an invitation.~ /*Well... Dannen was positive that our long months of playing in taverns had caught someone's attention, that we were being rewarded. He was overjoyed.*/
@151 = ~I urged Dannen to ignore the invitation, but naturally he would have none of it. It was the beginning of the end for us, really, though I did not know it. Perhaps it is a story I shall tell you some time.~
@152 = ~No, tell me the rest now.~
@153 = ~I'll hold you to that promise.~
@154 = ~Why would I want to hear about your sad breakup with Dannen?~
@155 = ~NP: No, enough of this story for now. I'm not in the mood,<CHARNAME> . Let's go, adventure awaits. It will cheer me up, I think.~ /*No, I've had enough of that story for now. I'm not in the mood, <CHARNAME>.*/
@156 = ~NP: I didn't promise anything. Maybe I'll tell... or maybe not. Let's see. Let's go, adventure awaits. It will cheer me up, I think.~ /*I didn't promise anything. Perhaps I'll tell you about it... perhaps not. We shall see.*/
@157 = ~NP: This story is not quite ordinary ... our love did not end the way it usually does. Even though you shouldn't hear it, I don't care. Let's go, adventure awaits. It will cheer me up, I think.~ /*The tale is a bit unusual... our love did not end in the usual way, I'd wager. Though you need not hear it at all, I care not.*/
@158 = ~NP: Um... I started talking about the invitation from Askatla, didn't I? Yes everything is correct. We went there, even though I had a bad feeling about it. The City of Coins was worthy of its name. It is a golden, glittering settlement that defies Waterdeep with its splendor. The palace we arrived at was larger than any building I had ever seen.~ /*The City of Coin lived up to its name. It was a golden, bustling place that rivalled even the great Waterdeep. The palace we arrived at was larger than any building I had ever seen.*/
@159 = ~Dannen assured me that we would find our fortune there, and for a while I thought he might be right. We were to play before the fabulously wealthy Lord and Lady Onaris, and all seemed well.~
@160 = ~What went wrong, then?~
@161 = ~Athkatla is a dangerous place, I hear.~
@162 = ~How did this Lord and Lady even know of you?~
@163 = ~NP: Nothing bad happened in the beginning. Dannen and I were prepared for the performance and everything went smoothly. We sang in a huge hall in front of hundreds of noble nobles. I still take my breath away at the memory ... and the applause for our duet was thunderous. I remember how fun and pleasant it was for me, and for Dannen too. It was then that Lord and Lady Onaris came over to personally congratulate us on our success.~ /*We sang in a great hall before several hundred nobles. It still takes my breath away to think about it... and the applause for our duet was thunderous.*/
@164 = ~Perhaps, though we were nowhere near its worst sections. We were welcomed into a world of wealth and luxury, with everything we desired delivered by eager slaves.~
@165 = ~That was my question, certainly, and not one that anybody seemed able to answer. The slaves doted on us, yet simply stared blankly when asked anything.~
@166 = ~Lord Onaris was a fat and simple man who seemed bored. The Lady, however... she was an exotic beauty. Violet eyes, elfin features, an astounding gown; every man watched as she passed.~
@167 = ~Uh-oh, that does sound bad...~
@168 = ~Did you ask why they invited you?~
@169 = ~NP: You're not a hobgoblin either, Sherwin.~ /*You're not exactly a hobgoblin, Sharwyn.*/
@170 = ~I would have hoped not. I would have hoped that love meant something, but Dannen didn't fail to notice her charms, that was certain.~
@171 = ~NP: Of course, I asked why we were invited. Lady Onaris ignored my question and approached Dannen, talking about seeing him in one of the taverns in Beregost and wanting to meet him. I was also in Beregost, of course... but they didn't pay any attention to me. She cooed with Dannen and he blushed with pleasure. He readily agreed to a one-year performance contract.~ /*Of course I asked why we were invited. Lady Onaris ignored me and fawned over Dannen, saying how she had spotted him in a lovely tavern in Beregost and had wanted to meet him.*/
@172 = ~Next to Lady Onaris, I might as well have been the homeliest hobgoblin you can imagine. She had a presence... and Dannen noticed it, too.~
@173 = ~Of course I was not happy about it. Dannen calmed me later and assured me there was nothing to worry about. Nothing could have been further from the truth.~
@174 = ~Oldest story in the book.~
@175 = ~He left you for the Lady, then?~
@176 = ~Why did you stand for it?~
@177 = ~NP: Maybe yes, maybe not. I fought for Dannen. However, all was not as it seemed. Be that as it may, I will continue this story another time. I'm tired of thinking about Dannen<CHARNAME> . Let's do something else.~ /*That is a tale I'll continue at another time, however. I tire of thinking about Dannen, <CHARNAME>. Let's do something else.*/
@178 = ~NP: Not right away. I fought for him... I thought our love would endure. However, all was not as it seemed. Be that as it may, I will continue this story another time. I'm tired of thinking about Dannen<CHARNAME> . Let's do something else.~ /*That is a tale I'll continue at another time, however. I tire of thinking about Dannen, <CHARNAME>. Let's do something else.*/
@179 = ~NP: You think I didn't fight for Dannen? Of course she fought. However, all was not as it seemed. Be that as it may, I will continue this story another time. I'm tired of thinking about Dannen<CHARNAME> . Let's do something else.~ /*That is a tale I'll continue at another time, however. I tire of thinking about Dannen, <CHARNAME>. Let's do something else.*/
@180 = ~NP: Fine,<CHARNAME> . I already said that we met Lady Onaris, right? How she courted Dannen, and he said that there was nothing to worry about? So now we were contracted...so we were performing. We did so well. After a while we became famous in Askatla and were universally praised by Lord and Lady Onaris.~ /*Well, we were bound by contract now to perform... so we did. We did so well, too. It was not long before we the toast of Athkatla, praised by the Lord and Lady Onaris at every turn.*/
@181 = ~NP: At each reception, the nobles surrounded us with attention and showered us with gifts. Everyone wanted us to perform next time with him. I was embarrassed by all this... but also dizzy. Lady Onaris continued to pay special attention to Dannen. She invited him to a private performance... without me... and he was fascinated despite my best efforts.~ /*Nobles showered us with attention and gifts at every turn. Everyone wanted us to perform for them next. I was a bit dazzled by it all... but also concerned.*/
@182 = ~Why didn't you leave him?~
@183 = ~Were they having an affair?~
@184 = ~You should have challenged her!~
@185 = ~NP: Throw it? I would never have thought of such a thing. He was my whole world... and the longer I went without him, the more lonely I felt. Desperate and angry, I accused Dannen of giving in to her lust. But he denied everything, denied it angrily... and I believed him. Almost. After one of our biggest gigs, I followed Dannen after he left the stage. I concealed myself with magic so that he and the servants would not find me, and silently followed.~ /*After one of our largest concerts, I followed Dannen as he left the stage. I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.*/
@186 = ~NP: I prayed it wasn't true. I suspected, but could not prove anything. The servants managed to mislead me, and they did not allow this private &quot;performance&quot; to be interrupted. Desperate and angry, I accused Dannen of giving in to her lust. But he denied everything, denied it angrily... and I believed him. Almost. After one of our biggest gigs, I followed Dannen after he left the stage. I concealed myself with magic so that he and the servants would not find me, and silently followed.~ /*After one of our largest concerts, I followed Dannen as he left the stage. I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.*/
@187 = ~NP: To be honest, I couldn't even find them. The palace was a real labyrinth, and the servants did everything so that I would not find their mistress. I tried. In vain. Desperate and angry, I accused Dannen of giving in to her lust. But he denied everything, denied it angrily... and I believed him. Almost. After one of our biggest gigs, I followed Dannen after he left the stage. I concealed myself with magic so that he and the servants would not find me, and silently followed.~ /*After one of our largest concerts, I followed Dannen as he left the stage. I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.*/
@188 = ~NP: I felt very guilty for such a deceit, but I hoped that my fears would be in vain. Of course, I was disappointed in that too. Unseen, I watched as Dannen arrived at his rendezvous with Lady Onaris, as he covered her body in kisses and told her that every minute away from her was torment.~ /*I watched invisibly as Dannen made his rendezvous with Lady Onaris, laying fevered kisses upon her and saying how every minute they were apart was excrutiating to him.*/
@189 = ~I would have killed him, if I were you.~
@190 = ~You should have left.~
@191 = ~Why did they bother to keep it secret from you?~
@192 = ~NP: Yes, that thought crossed my mind as I stood there. I wanted to kill her. I wanted to kill myself. In an instant, I was betrayed, deceived and broke my heart. In shock, I forgot about magic and Lady Onaris saw me. But she didn't care...she just laughed and pointed me to Dannen. And he just looked at me and smiled. I stood and listened dumbfounded as Dannen called me a stupid little girl. Pitiful fool. He didn't just prefer Lady Onaris... he never *ever* loved me.~ /*I merely stood there dumbfounded as Dannen called me a foolish little girl. Pathetic, even. Not only did he prefer Lady Onaris... but he had *never* loved me.*/
@193 = ~NP: Your truth. If I had understood at least something then, I would have left. I was young and in love... and that leaves no room for reason. In shock, I forgot about magic and Lady Onaris saw me. But she didn't care...she just laughed and pointed me to Dannen. And he just looked at me and smiled. I stood and listened dumbfounded as Dannen called me a stupid little girl. Pitiful fool. He didn't just prefer Lady Onaris... he never *ever* loved me.~ /*I merely stood there dumbfounded as Dannen called me a foolish little girl. Pathetic, even. Not only did he prefer Lady Onaris... but he had *never* loved me.*/
@194 = ~I fled, their mocking laughter ringing in my ears. I fled them, I fled Athkatla... and I have never been back.~
@195 = ~That's horrible, Sharwyn.~
@196 = ~You should have taken revenge. I would have.~
@197 = ~So he cheated on you. Why be so dramatic?~
@198 = ~I would never treat you like that, Sharwyn.~
@199 = ~Yes, I was devastated. I had left the security of my family to make Dannen my world, and it had crumbled around me. As I said, however, things were not as they seemed.~
@200 = ~I was young, a fool and in love. I should have known better, obviously. As I said, however, things were not as they seemed.~
@201 = ~Hah! Were I as cynical as I am now... or as you are... things would never have reached that point to begin with. I was a fool. As I said before, however, everything was not as it seemed.~
@202 = ~NP: I... this, I... T-thank you<CHARNAME> . I don't even know what to say. Although your intentions are... sweet, I don't think this is the right time. As I said, not everything was as it seemed.~ /*While your intentions are... are sweet, I doubt that would be the case. As I said, not everything was as it seemed.*/
@203 = ~NP: Much later, I found out that Lady Onaris's beauty is nothing but the result of... a charm. She bewitched Dannen in the truest sense of the word. I also found out that her spell can remove a lock of a nymph's hair. Dannen will be released... and her spell will be broken. She will become what she really is: old and fat, as I was told.~ /*I have also discovered that a lock of nymph's hair will break her spell. Dannen will be released... and her glamour will end. She will revert to her natural appearance: old and fat, so I hear.*/
@204 = ~Are you sure Dannen is still with her?~
@205 = ~Would you take him back, now that you know?~
@206 = ~What will that prove?~
@207 = ~Yes, so the story goes, at any rate. He has been a famous bard in Athkatla for years, and she is still his patron. A fairy tale that will end one day.~
@208 = ~No. The hurt was too real, even if the glamour wasn't. At some level, I would always blame him for... not being strong enough. It doesn't matter.~
@209 = ~Dannen wasn't strong enough to resist the spell... I will always blame him for that, a little. I would like to free him. Then he can decide for himself whether to stay with her... based on the truth, not an illusion.~
@210 = ~NP: Maybe everyone has a right to their little illusions. I admit that it would give me some pleasure to remove this spell once and for all. All you have to do is find a lock of nymph's hair. One day, maybe I'll find that hair.~ /*Everyone should be allowed their little illusions, perhaps. I admit that it would give me some small satisfaction to remove her spell once and for all.*/
@211 = ~I believe I have a lock of nymph's hair, here.~
@212 = ~We'll find you some nymph's hair, Sharwyn.~
@213 = ~Just don't get preoccupied with it.~
@214 = ~Are you sure revenge will be so satisfying?~
@215 = ~NP: Is that the hair of a nymph? You are a miracle<CHARNAME> . Dannen will be released, and Lady Onaris will turn into the fat old woman that she really is. Is this what I really want? I have been waiting for this for a very long time, but for some reason I do not feel joy.~ /*That is nymph's hair isn't it? You are a marvel, <CHARNAME>. Dannen will be freed and Lady Onaris revealed for the fat old woman she is.*/
@216 = ~Perhaps you should just let it be, then.~
@217 = ~Dannen should be free from the spell, at least, no?~
@218 = ~Lady Onaris hurt you. She deserves to be revealed for what she is.~
@219 = ~You don't need Dannen anymore, I guess.~
@220 = ~I believe you, <CHARNAME>. It doesn't matter... we have more important things to do, here.~
@221 = ~I'm not. I actually hadn't thought about Dannen, much, until I told you the story. Come... let's return to your task.~
@222 = ~I... don't know, really. Maybe. Come on... let's get back to your mission, shall we?~
@223 = ~NP: This is true. Well, of course, your experience suggests it. I've been addicted to this idea for too long<CHARNAME> ... it's time to forget about it. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Anyway, you might notice that the belt I gave you earlier is better. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@224 = ~NP: Um. Maybe with time the spell wore off... and maybe it really was his choice. What if it wasn't? I think that's what I owe him. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Anyway, you may notice that the belt I gave you earlier is better. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@225 = ~NP: Um. I think so. Who knows what else she'll do with her charms? Better put an end to all this. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Anyway, you may notice that the belt I gave you earlier is better. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@226 = ~NP: No. No, that's probably what it is. I am no longer a part of his life. And I don't want any more. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Anyway, you might notice that the belt I gave you earlier is better. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@227 = ~NP: This is true. Well, of course, your experience suggests it. I've been addicted to this idea for too long<CHARNAME> ... it's time to forget about it. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Until then, take this belt. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@228 = ~NP: Um. Maybe with time the spell wore off... and maybe it really was his choice. What if it wasn't? I think that's what I owe him. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Until then, take this belt. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@229 = ~NP: Um. I think so. Who knows what else she'll do with her charms? Better put an end to all this. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Until then, take this belt. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@230 = ~NP: No. No, that's probably what it is. I am no longer a part of his life. And I don't want any more. Thank you. I would like to thank you with something beyond words. Maybe I'll come up with something later. Until then, take this belt. Come on, we gotta move on, right?~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I wish I had something more to thank you with. Maybe I'll think of something later. Let's go on, shall we?*/
@231 = ~I returned to Neverwinter, <CHARNAME>, and that's all there is to it. One day I shall find my lock of nymph's hair and I shall have my satisfaction.~
@232 = ~Not right now, <CHARNAME>. Later, perhaps.~
@233 = ~NP: The cult can be located almost anywhere, it is. But I know a few places where it's more likely to be found. I have heard more than once about monsters raiding the roads in the area of the crossroads, right at the exit from Port Llast.~ /*The cult could be practically anywhere, that's true. I can think of a few places where chances might be greater of finding them, however.*/
@234 = ~Monsters?~
@235 = ~That's enough information for now.~
@236 = ~NP: Mostly bugbears and orcs. However, they say they are controlled by people, this is very strange. In any case, ever since Luskan's mind was set on his own affairs, the surrounding provinces have been the target of constant raids... but these monsters are more organized than usual. Maybe there's a cult behind it all, who knows? In any case, Mutamin has already wept a lake of tears about his precious competition.~ /*At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.*/
@237 = ~What contest is this?~
@238 = ~NP: He is not well known, but the owner of the Green Griffin seems to hold a major competition every few years. The winner gets rich enough. Nobles come from all directions to watch this action... but it's unlikely that anyone will come along such dangerous roads, right? I would like to know what's the matter here.~ /*Nobles flock from all over the place to watch, apparently... although not with the roads so dangerous, right? I wish I knew what it was all about.*/
@239 = ~NP: There are many caves in the hills at the crossroads, I think you should explore them... this is the only way to find out where the monsters are. I don't see any other way to find the cult, so the only thing left to do is go and see, right? Can you do it? I think it's worth going.~ /*Beyond going and taking a look, I can't think of any other way to find this cult. Can you? I say we go.*/
@240 = ~How about telling me a tale, Sharwyn? You are a bard, after all.~
@241 = ~NP: I want to hear your story.~ /*Me want to hear you story.*/
@242 = ~I normally save my best tales for taverns with a full audience. Why should I recount a tale only for you, <CHARNAME>?~
@243 = ~Because I asked you nicely?~
@244 = ~Because I told you to and you work for me, that's why.~
@245 = ~I suppose I could pay you, if you like.~
@246 = ~Because I love listening to your lovely voice?~
@247 = ~NP: Wow? Means,<CHARNAME> starts flirting with me and I should immediately rush to him? Ha ha! That's what I'll tell you<CHARNAME> . I'll tell you your story if you promise to listen carefully.~ /*I'll tell you what, <CHARNAME>. I'll tell you your tale... if you promise to listen attentively and be a proper audience.*/
@248 = ~I can do that.~
@249 = ~Oh, get on with it already.~
@250 = ~Bah! Forget it, then.~
@251 = ~NP: OK OK. Means<MALEFEMALE> with his heroic reputation is snapping his fingers, and I have to be ready, so what? Ha ha! That's what I'll tell you<CHARNAME> . I'll tell you your story if you promise to listen carefully.~ /*I see, I see. So the tough <PRO_MANWOMAN> snaps <PRO_HISHER> fingers, and I better shape up, is that it? Ha ha!*/
@252 = ~NP: Pay me? You think I'm doing this for coins in a tavern, don't you? Well, of course not. I do it for the listeners! That's what I'll tell you<CHARNAME> . I'll tell you your story if you promise to listen carefully.~ /*Pay me? You think I do it for the coin I receive in a tavern, such as it is? Certainly not. I do it for the audience!*/
@253 = ~NP: Mmmm... sounds tempting, I must admit. Maybe I should ask you to take off your tunic while we're talking, just to be honest? Ha ha! That's what I'll tell you<CHARNAME> . I'll tell you your story if you promise to listen carefully.~ /*Mmmm... tempting, I must admit. Perhaps I should ask you to remove your tunic while I talk, so we could be equal? Ha ha!*/
@254 = ~NP: Well, good! Catch you up on that. But what story should I tell? Tell a story about<CHARNAME> , the hero, savior of Neverwinter, and his quest for the Words of Power?~ /*But what story should I tell, then? Shall I tell a tale of the great <CHARNAME>, savior of Neverwinter, and <PRO_HISHER> search for the Words of Power?*/
@255 = ~I think I know that one.~
@256 = ~NP: Oh, how impatient we are! I take this as an agreement, and I will remember it for you later. But what story should I tell? Tell a story about<CHARNAME> , the hero, savior of Neverwinter, and his quest for the Words of Power?~ /*But what story should I tell, then? Shall I tell a tale of the great <CHARNAME>, savior of Neverwinter, and <PRO_HISHER> search for the Words of Power?*/
@257 = ~NP: Ha ha! I'm surprised you even ask this. Why should I waste my breath on someone who can't even listen to me? Well, enough words then...let's continue to create your own story.~ /*Ha ha! I'm surprised you even asked in the first place, then. Why you think I would waste breath on someone who can't listen is beyond me.*/
@258 = ~NP: I won't tell it, trust me. Perhaps this is true ... Everything is too familiar in it, and I'm not sure about the end yet. Um. Well, what about the sad story about the great Lady Aribeth? Torn between love and honor and fallen into sin before her god?~ /*Hmm. How about the sad tale of the great Lady Aribeth? Torn between love and honor, fallen from the grace of Tyr?*/
@259 = ~That's not very funny.~
@260 = ~I've heard the ending.~
@261 = ~Don't even go there, Sharwyn.~
@262 = ~NP: I didn't know you wanted to listen to comedy<CHARNAME> . Aribeth's story is sad... whatever, I'll think of something else. How about the story of the great Lord Nasher? About his glory days, before he became an old, sad ruler?~ /*You never said you wanted to hear a comedy, <CHARNAME>. Aribeth's is a sad tale... but no matter, I'll think of something else.*/
@263 = ~How about something original?~
@264 = ~NP: This is so, isn't it? It's a pity ... her story is very sad, I just want to tell it. Let's see... I'll think of something else. How about the story of the great Lord Nasher? About his glory days, before he became an old, sad ruler?~ /*That's true, isn't it? Too bad... hers is a sad tale that itches to be told. Let's see... I'll think of something else.*/
@265 = ~NP: Your truth. I'm sorry... I didn't mean to disrespect the lady. Her story is so sad that it directly asks to be told, but I will think of something else. How about the story of the great Lord Nasher? About his glory days, before he became an old, sad ruler?~ /*You are right. I apologize... it was not my intent to make light of the Lady. Hers is a sad tale that begs to be told, but I will think of something else.*/
@266 = ~You're going to be picky, are you? Very well, then... give me some time to think about it. For now, let's continue with the making of your own tale.~
@267 = ~All right. I've thought about which story to tell you, <CHARNAME>. It is an old one... the story of Tamorlyn and the Song of Love.~
@268 = ~NP: Love? Ugh!~ /*Love? Bah!*/
@269 = ~This had better be good.~
@270 = ~It sound promising.~
@271 = ~NP: Shh. We agreed that you would be quiet, if I'm not mistaken, so be quiet. Tamorlin was an elven bard, one of the most talented and famous in those old days. In the prime of his life, he was happily married and had many children... but something was missing, as if something had been left unfinished.~ /*Tamorlyn was an elven bard, one of the most talented and famous from an age ago. At the peak of his life he was happily married with numerous children... yet still he felt he had left something undone.*/
@272 = ~NP: I'm glad you agree. Now, since you promise not to disturb me, be quiet. Tamorlin was an elven bard, one of the most talented and famous in those old days. In the prime of his life, he was happily married and had many children... but something was missing, as if something had been left unfinished.~ /*Tamorlyn was an elven bard, one of the most talented and famous from an age ago. At the peak of his life he was happily married with numerous children... yet still he felt he had left something undone.*/
@273 = ~NP: One day, with tears in his eyes, he said goodbye to his children, pressed his faithful wife to his chest, promised to return and set off on the greatest journey of his long life. He spent decades searching for Hanali Celanil, the elven goddess of love. He called to her from her temples, walked the fields of Arvandor, sang to her from the highest mountain peaks. And when he already began to think that he could no longer search, his thoughts returned to his wife and children. But Hanali Celanil finally came down to him.~ /*For decades he searched for Hanali Celanil, the elven goddess of love. He called to her from her temples, walked the fields of Arvandor, serenaded her from the highest mountaintops.*/
@274 = ~NP: She was the most beautiful of the elves. She had warm eyes, and she was dressed in silver and gold. &quot;You were looking for me...&quot; she spoke, &quot;and I came. What do you want from me?&quot; Tamorlin was smitten almost to the point of madness by her beauty, and yet he spoke. &quot;Hanali Celanil,&quot; he said, &quot;also called Lady of the Golden Heart, Beautiful Rose, Mother of Sadness. I have a request for you.&quot; &quot;I desire to know the true meaning of love so that I can write a song that will break the hearts of both mortals and immortals. Will you give me such a gift?&quot;~ /*Tamorlyn was almost overcome by her beauty, but still he spoke. "Hanali Celanil," he said, "also called Lady Goldheart, the Winsome Rose, the Mother of Sadness. I wish a boon."*/
@275 = ~The goddess thought on his offer and smiled. "I am the Three Who Are One, child. Perform a task for each of us and you shall know the true meaning of love... and be rewarded."~
@276 = ~"Three Who Are One?"~
@277 = ~NP: Yes. The Queen of Arvandor is the elven goddess of Angharrad... but she is also known as the three goddesses, the three aspects being One. One, of course, is Hanali Celanil... the goddess of love and the golden elves. The second is Erdri Faenya, the goddess of the sky, she patronizes the winged people of Avariel. The third is Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of dreams and moon elves. Of course, Tamorlin readily agreed to the task. However, I will tell you about this another time, because I see that you have other things to do.~ /*One, of course, is Hanali Celanil... goddess of love and the gold elves. One is Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of the sky and the winged avariel. The third is Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of dreams and the moon elves.*/
@278 = ~Oh, come on! Tell me now!~
@279 = ~NP: Okay, let's go.~ /*Is okay, I guess.*/
@280 = ~Ha ha! To be honest, <CHARNAME>, I've forgotten how part of the story goes. Let's just keep moving... I'll remember the rest eventually.~
@281 = ~Good enough. I can tell the rest of the tale when we get a chance, later.~
@282 = ~NP: Indeed. I think I already remembered what happened next. I already said that Tamorlin agreed to complete tasks for each aspect of the triune goddess, right? The first assignment was for Erdrey Faenya. He had to get the feathers of the largest phoenix that flies in the skies over the distant southern countries. For many years Tamorlin combed the highest mountain peaks of Turmish and Chondath, following the legends of great birds, though he never saw one.~ /*Fair enough. I think I remember how the rest of it goes, now. I told you that Tamorlyn had agreed to do a task for each of the Triune, correct?*/
@283 = ~NP: A century of hardship passed before Tamorlin returned to that same northern mountain, exhausted, but triumphantly holding a feather from the wing of a great phoenix. For Sehanin Moonbow, he had to find pieces of our three moons that fell to the ground in a fiery flame. He spent another century searching for them... deeply buried, long forgotten and scattered across different lands. Finally, with tears in his eyes, he returned with three small stone shards in his hands.~ /*Another century he would spend in search of them... long-buried, long-forgotten and scattered. Finally, with tears in his eyes, he returned with the three rock shards in his hands.*/
@284 = ~NP: For Hanali Celanil, he had to find the heart of a golden dragon that had died of old age... No one had ever even tried to look for such a thing. He groaned, but was determined. He searched for many centuries in a row, following the rumors, until he finally came to the northern lands, where he heard about a dying snake. Tamorlin spent many years looking for this creature, and then, to befriend him, sang songs to him as he grew weaker year by year.~ /*For Hanali Celanil he would seek the golden heart of a dragon dead of simple age... one of the rarest things someone could seek. He wailed at the thought but was determined.*/
@285 = ~NP: When the great beast died, Tamorlin was sad... but also happy, because now his wanderings were coming to an end. However, on the way back to the goddess, one of his fellow tribesmen found him and told him the terrible news that his wife and children had died of a terrible disease during his absence. Grief-stricken, Tamorlin sobbed and beside himself with anger began to scold the goddess for keeping him away from his family for so long. But she didn't answer.~ /*Before Tamorlyn could return to the goddess, however, he was found by one of his own people. He was told the sad news that his beloved wife and children had died of a terrible illness during his absence.*/
@286 = ~NP: Tamorlin poured out his pain, bitterness and sorrow in song. Since he could no longer sing about love, he sang about it... He sang about all that he had lost. And he sang this song to the goddess. Finally the goddess Hanali Celanil came to him with tears in her golden eyes. &quot;At last you understand the meaning of love, child,&quot; she said. &quot;As I promised you, you will be rewarded.&quot; And so, she raised Tamorlin through the gates of Arvandor, where he was reunited with his wife and children to spend eternity with them in paradise. That's all.~ /*And finally Hanali Celanil came, with tears flowing from her golden eyes. "You understand at last the meaning of love, child," she said. "As I promised, you shall be rewarded."*/
@287 = ~That is a beautiful story...~
@288 = ~What? She killed him? That is utter crap.~
@289 = ~Do you believe that about love?~
@290 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad you enjoyed it.~
@291 = ~Why did you tell me that story, by the way?~
@292 = ~You don't think it's true, do you?~
@293 = ~There's always a critic, isn't there? I'm surprised you could sit through the whole thing... if you even listened to it all.~
@294 = ~I... I don't know. I think love is different for everyone. You have to decide for yourself what you love most, what it means to you.~
@295 = ~What about you?~
@296 = ~NP: Well... I don't know how true this legend is, but something about it is true, that's for sure. Indeed, there was such an elven bard named Tamorlin... and he, in fact, died somewhere in these places. It is said that he actually wrote the song before he died...or is it just a rumor. He was the greatest bard that ever lived, and his song must have been a true masterpiece.~ /*Well... I don't know how much of that legend might be true, but I know there's some truth to it. There really was an elven bard named Tamorlyn... and he really did die in this region.*/
@297 = ~NP: Don't know,<CHARNAME> . To tell the truth, I don't know. Love and I... we never really got along. Maybe sometime in the future, who knows? But I don't want to think about it just yet, I hope you understand.~ /*Maybe in the future, who knows? But I don't want to think about that just yet. I hope you understand.*/
@298 = ~To get my hands on it... to have a chance to sing it, to bring it to the world. That would be everything, <CHARNAME>.~
@299 = ~What about this? Is this the song you're talking about?~
@300 = ~Maybe we'll find it. Who knows?~
@301 = ~It's probably just a myth, Sharwyn.~
@302 = ~NP: It's... it's written in elvish, and... and the notes... oh gods! It's... it's Tamorlin's signature! It's her, it's her<CHARNAME> ! How did you manage to find her?! She... she's beautiful. He really was a master. I... I almost believed that it was just a fairy tale, that it couldn't be, but it's true, isn't it?~ /*It... it's written in elven, and... and the notes are... oh my! That... that's Tamorlyn's signature! This is it, this is it, <CHARNAME>! How did you ever find it?!*/
@303 = ~What are you going to do with it?~
@304 = ~Sometimes even fairy tales are true, I guess.~
@305 = ~It's just a song, Sharwyn.~
@306 = ~That's true. Who knows if it would still be in good condition, even... but I can always dream. That's what being a bard is all about.~
@307 = ~You're probably right. I won't keep my hopes up, but you never know.~
@308 = ~NP: I'm not sure. I want to sing it... I want to spread it around the world, as Tamorlin once wanted. I should probably sing it to the elves first, who knows? I don't even know how I can thank you for this gift,<CHARNAME> . I... I hope my friendship will be enough...~ /*I'm not sure. I want to sing it... I want to spread it just like Tamorlyn intended it to be, I think. Perhaps I'll sing it to the elves, first, who knows?*/
@309 = ~Your friendship is repayment enough, Sharwyn.~
@310 = ~Sounds like I'm getting the short end of the deal.~
@311 = ~You're not going anywhere, are you?~
@312 = ~I was hoping for something more than friendship...~
@313 = ~NP: Yes, I think sometimes they are. Oh... I can't wait until I can finally sing it to the right listeners, spread it around the world like Tamorlin once wanted. I don't even know how I can thank you for this gift,<CHARNAME> . I... I hope my friendship will be enough...~ /*Yes, I suppose sometimes they are. Oh... I can't wait to sing this to a proper audience, to spread it just as Tamorlyn intended it to be.*/
@314 = ~NP: It's not just a song. It's much more! I can't wait to sing it... to spread it around the world like Tamorlin once wanted. I don't even know how I can thank you for this gift,<CHARNAME> . I... I hope my friendship will be enough...~ /*I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>. I... I hope my friendship will be enough...*/
@315 = ~NP: Thank you,<CHARNAME> . Know that I'm not going to run from you... the song can wait. Your mission is more important. Let's go and get it over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I want you to know that I've no intention of running out on you... the song can wait. Your mission comes first.*/
@316 = ~NP: Then I will repay you otherwise<CHARNAME> . I'm not going anywhere... I'll help you until the very end, I promise. Let's go and get this over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*Then I'll repay you some other way, <CHARNAME>. I'm not going anywhere... I'll continue to help you to the end, I promise.*/
@317 = ~NP: No, of course not. The song will wait... I will help you complete your task until the very end, I promise. Let's go and get it over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*No, of course not. The song can wait... I'll help you in your mission until the end, I promise.*/
@318 = ~NP: Is it true? I... I would really like it<CHARNAME> . I know there are more important things to do right now, but once this is over... That would be great. The song will wait... I'll be with you until it's over, and when that moment comes... well, then we'll see. I adore you,<CHARNAME> ... I have long wanted to tell you this. Let's go and get it over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*The song can wait... I'll stand by your side until this is over, and once it is... well, we'll see what happens then. I do adore you, <CHARNAME>... I want you to know that.*/
@319 = ~My tale's done, <CHARNAME>. As I said, though, there's supposedly some truth to it... wouldn't it be wonderful to actually find Tamorlyn's lost song?~
@320 = ~Perhaps later, <CHARNAME>, but now isn't the time. We must hurry if we're to find the Words of Power.~
@321 = ~NP: All I can offer<CHARNAME> , it's an old legend that I heard a long time ago. There must be some ancient ruins south of Fort Ilkard... older than any settlement in the northern lands, so the legends say. It is said that it was once the home of a &quot;creator race&quot; that is older than the elves themselves, you know. However, no one has yet returned from there, so anything can be there.~ /*It was supposedly once the home of a 'creator race' that predates even the elves, if you can imagine that. I've never heard of anyone returning from it, though, so it could be anything.*/
@322 = ~Do you know any more about it?~
@323 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@324 = ~NP: Well, the magic power in those parts must be incredible. There are monoliths of stone, which are dangerous even to approach. But all this is dubious information, I know. The only way to know for sure is to go and check it out for yourself.~ /*Well, the magic power in the area is supposed to be incredible. There are stone monoliths which are too dangerous even to approach.*/
@325 = ~So the end draws near, does it? I suppose all tales must end sooner or later. Any regrets, <CHARNAME>?~ [Sharsay]
@326 = ~A few, perhaps.~
@327 = ~No. No regrets.~
@328 = ~I regret we've never kissed. Does that count?~
@329 = ~Only that I brought your loud mouth along.~
@330 = ~Truly? Perhaps you will forget them once this is finally over. All of Faerun will celebrate you as a true hero after this. You know that, don't you?~
@331 = ~I'm doing this because it's right, not to be a hero.~
@332 = ~Don't be a fool. I do this because the money is good.~
@333 = ~Nothing wrong with being a hero, I suppose.~
@334 = ~I won't be the only hero, Sharwyn.~
@335 = ~I didn't think so. After all... when this is finally over all of Faerun will celebrate you as a true hero. You know that, don't you?~
@336 = ~I don't know. Maybe. I suspect I could be talked into it... especially since both our deaths could literally be around the next corner.~
@337 = ~NP: Ha! Say what you want,<CHARNAME> ... in this legend, my name is next to yours, whether you like it or not. I will gladly play my part. But I think that there is no point in continuing to scratch you the wrong way. Let's end this story the way it should be, okay?~ /*Hah! Say what you like, <CHARNAME>... my own legend is being written right alongside yours, whether you like it or not. I'm glad to play my part.*/
@338 = ~You know, that's what I like about you. I'll have to make sure your tale is penned properly. I'm sure I won't be the only bard eager to write of your legend.~
@339 = ~I'll just be happy if things go back to normal after this.~
@340 = ~I don't think I'm a legend...~
@341 = ~They can write what they like, so long as I get the royalties.~
@342 = ~Bah. It's a foolish business.~
@343 = ~I didn't suggest that all heroes are altruistic paladins... but that's how they end up somehow, isn't it? I wonder how bards will write your legend?~
@344 = ~Indeed. You will have earned your place, I think. They will be writing of your legend for an age to come, <CHARNAME>.~
@345 = ~That's kind of you to say, <CHARNAME>. Regardless, you will be the one the bards write of when they tell your legend.~
@346 = ~NP: I doubt that anything can return to normal for you now,<CHARNAME> . I envy you. As for me... I should probably thank you for getting me this far. If I survive, perhaps in the future I will be able to find my great adventure. If I'm lucky. Of course... that doesn't mean we have to break up. I really like our union. I would love to continue traveling with you, if you don't mind.~ /*As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky.*/
@347 = ~So would I, Sharwyn.~
@348 = ~Who knows what will happen?~
@349 = ~Ha! You're on your own after this.~
@350 = ~Aren't you being a bit premature?~
@351 = ~NP: Ha! You can deny if you want<CHARNAME> but your fate is predetermined. I doubt that anything can return to normal for you now,<CHARNAME> . I envy you. As for me... I should probably thank you for getting me this far. If I survive, perhaps in the future I will be able to find my great adventure. If I'm lucky. Of course... that doesn't mean we have to break up. I really like our union. I would love to continue traveling with you, if you don't mind.~ /*As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky.*/
@352 = ~NP: Well said. I will remember your words so that I can quote them. As for me... I should probably thank you for getting me this far. If I survive, perhaps in the future I will be able to find my great adventure. If I'm lucky. Of course... that doesn't mean we have to break up. I really like our union. I would love to continue traveling with you, if you don't mind.~ /*As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky.*/
@353 = ~NP: Fine. Of course... you have to finish one story before I start writing the next one, don't you? In that case, go ahead<CHARNAME> ... let's end this story the way it should end.~ /*Good. Of course... we've one tale to finish, first, before we start writing the next, don't we?*/
@354 = ~NP: And it's true. In any case, it's worth finishing one story before I start writing the next one. In that case, go ahead<CHARNAME> ... let's end this story the way it should end.~ /*True enough. I suppose we've one tale to finish, first, before I start writing the next, anyway.*/
@355 = ~NP: That's probably how it should be. It's a pity. In any case... one story needs to be finished before I start writing the next one. In that case, go ahead<CHARNAME> ...let's end this story the way it should end.~ /*I suppose that's how it has to be. Too bad. At any rate... we've one tale to finish before I go writing the next.*/
@356 = ~It's not as if you'll be lacking for company should we succeed, <CHARNAME>. You'll be a hero throughout Faerun with women falling at your feet. You know that, don't you?~
