@0 = ~Welcome to the Temple of Tyr. Should you require the services of a priest, please speak to Neurik.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I am here about Rolgan's trial.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~I am Edegar, a minor acolyte in the service of Tyr. Though I have little in the way of divine powers, I try to make myself useful by performing the day to day functions around the temple.~
@5 = ~Of course, of course. Neurik has done me a great honor by selecting me for the jury in this case. I am looking forward to performing my duties in the administration of Tyr's justice.~
@6 = ~How do you feel about this case?~
@7 = ~How much would it cost to get you to bring back an innocent verdict at the trial?~
@8 = ~May the sword of Tyr's justice watch over you and keep you safe.~
@9 = ~If you need the services of a true cleric you will have to speak to Neurik.~
@10 = ~Even though I disapprove of the Uthgardt's worship of a pagan god, I am not going to pre-judge him. The real culprit in this crime is the demon alcohol. Of course the alcohol does not excuse the Uthgardt's behavior. Anyone who lets themself get drunk must bear the consequences of his actions. This is why I so strongly disapprove of consuming alcoholic beverages.~ 
@11 = ~You dare offer a bribe to me here in the Hall of Justice! I should report you to Neurik and have you barred from the case!~
@12 = ~It was just a joke, relax...~
@13 = ~But I am keeping an open mind. I wish you well in this case, my <LADYLORD>. May the justice of Tyr be served.~
@14 = ~Yes, well, your jest was in very poor taste. I won't report you to Neurik, but I suggest in the future you approach this matter with the gravity it deserves.~
@15 = ~Go.~ 
@16 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. I hope you are not feeling any guilt in failing to gain an acquital for the Uthgardt warrior - his blood is not on your hands.~
@17 = ~You did your duty in this matter and presented the evidence to the court so justice might be served. Sometimes it is difficult for people to accept that Tyr's justice is harsh. I know Neurik appreciates all you have done to aid the Temple in this matter.~ 
@18 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. I must congratulate you on your performance at Rolgan's trial. You truly served the cause of justice in his acquital.~
@19 = ~I know Neurik appreciates all you have done to aid the Temple in this matter.~
