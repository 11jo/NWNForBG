She shays I'm drunk! She can't treat me like thish! I'm Lillian Cambridge! Aarin Gend wantsh my help to find them Wordsh of Power!~ [NWLILL54] 
@1 = ~I think you've had enough to drink, Lillian.~
@2 = ~Maybe I should get you another drink so you'll pass out and quit your drunken babbling.~
@3 = ~What can you tell me about the Words of Power?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~You can't talk to me like thish! I'm not shome drunk - I'm a reshpected arche... archeolo... I'm a reshpected exshpert in my field!~
@6 = ~I used to have one of them Wordsh  of Power, you know. It was inshide thish pretty shnow globe. *hic* But now shome hero went and got it out, and shnow globe is empty - empty and all alone. I need another drink to get my shpirits up! *hic* If you shee the bartender tell him to bring me another bottle. Thish one's almosht empty.~ 
@7 = ~I need another drink to get my shpirits up! *hic* If you shee the bartender tell him to bring me another bottle. Thish one's almosht empty.~
@8 = ~**hic** Hey, I know you! You're one of them herosshh Gend hired to find them Words of Power, right! **hic** Shhure, that's you. You should really try the wine in thish place. The firsht couple bottles ain't so good, but after that... woweee!~ [NWLILL54] 
@9 = ~You're drunk!~
@10 = ~I am not drunk! *giggle* I am Lillian Cambridge, archeologisht eshtrodinaire! Gend wantsh me to help you herosh find them Words of Power. Go ahead, ashk me a queshtion.~
@11 = ~I need to find the Words of Power.~
@12 = ~I'll be going now.~
@13 = ~You should go inshide my shnow globe. There's one of them Words of Power in there. At leasht, there used to be.~
@14 = ~What are you talking about?~
@15 = ~Off you goes then. If you see the bartender, be a doll and tell him my glassh ish almost empty. Thanks, love.~
@16 = ~Inshide my room. Up the stairs. Shecond door on the left. There'sh a snow globe on a pedeshtal. Inshide is a tiny little world. *giggle* A whole tiny world inshide that shnow globe, and the Word of Power is inshide, too.~ 
@17 = ~How do I get into the snow globe?~
@18 = ~Just go up an touch the shnow globe. POOF! You're inshide! Jusht don't expect me to come shave you if you get into trouble. That's too dangeroush for me. I'll jus' shtay here and drink my wine.~ 
@19 = ~About time you showed up. I've been waiting at least ten minutes for someone to come by and refill my drink!~ [NWLILL57]
@20 = ~I'm not here to fill your drink. I work for Aarin Gend.~ 
@21 = ~I was hoping you could tell me something about this snow globe.~
@22 = ~Ah, yes. <CHARNAME>, the hero of Neverwinter. I'd drink a toast to your legendary deeds if my glass wasn't empty. My name is Lillian Cambridge, archeologist. I'm the North's leading expert in antiquities and ancient artifacts. No doubt Aarin Gend has told you that I've come to offer my rather unique knowledge to aid the cause of the Lords' Alliance.~ 
@23 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@24 = ~A snow globe? There was just such an item stolen from me some time ago by a rather charming mage named Nax. Is it possible you have recovered my missing treasure? Let me see it, <CHARNAME>. I must examine it to be certain this is the snow globe that was stolen from me.~ 
@25 = ~Tell me where I can find the snow globe again.~
@26 = ~I've got the snow globe right here.~
@27 = ~That is why I'm here: to answer your questions about the Words of Power and the Creator Race that constructed them... And to sample the local wines, of course.~
@28 = ~Where can I find the Words of Power?~
@29 = ~Tell me about the Creator Race.~
@30 = ~How did you end up here in Beorunna's Well?~
@31 = ~I need some directions.~
@32 = ~Let me see it, <CHARNAME>. I must examine it to be certain this is the snow globe that was stolen from me.~
@33 = ~Hold on, what about a reward?~
@34 = ~Here, take the snow globe.~
@35 = ~If it were as simple as drawing you a map, <CHARNAME>, I'd have told Aarin Gend everything I know. You have to remember that the Words are thousands and thousands of years old. The Creator Race that fashioned the Words predated even the first Elven kingdoms. Everything I know about them is theory and conjecture upon a foundation of myth and legend.~ 
@36 = ~Surely you must know something.~
@37 = ~Some expert you turned out to be.~
@38 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@39 = ~The Creators resembled our modern day lizardman, though they were far more intelligent and far more powerful than any of the scaled humanoids who exist today. Little is known about them, save that they were a cruel and ruthless empire, slaughtering or enslaving the other races whenever they came across them.~ 
@40 = ~There are many strange and exotic artifacts scattered throughout the north, and I spend much of my time in and around this area on archeological digs. Burial mounds, ancient tombs, crypts... It's amazing what sort of treasures you can unearth!~ 
@41 = ~You're nothing more than a common grave robber!~
@42 = ~But how did you end up working for Aarin Gend?~
@43 = ~I'm afraid I can't help you there. Since I've arrived at Beorunna's Well I've hardly left this inn. My room is clean and comfortable, and the wine here is quite palatable, after the first few glasses. Besides, I don't think the camp is that difficult to find your way around in. Now, is there something else I can help you with?~ 
@44 = ~A reward? Yes, of course. Give me the snow globe and I will tell you where to find one of the Words of Power. But first I must verify that this snow globe is truly the one I seek.~
@45 = ~This snow globe is pretty valuable to you. I think you could spare some coin for its return.~
@46 = ~Let me see... yes, this is it! The snow globe Nax stole from me! Well done, <CHARNAME>! Now, to put it somewhere safe. (She mutters something and the globe vanishes.)~
@47 = ~It's gone!~
@48 = ~I can tell you that there were several Words of Power created, but they have been scattered throughout the North and lost for countless millennia. All that remain are rumors of where they might have disappeared. Some believe the Words were taken by the dragons who dwell in the mountains to the west. Others claim clues to their location may be found in the long deserted ruins far to the south of Fort Ilkard, or hidden in the forests to the north.~ 
@49 = ~What became of the Creators I cannot say. For centuries they ruled this land and then suddenly they vanished, leaving virtually no evidence they had ever existed at all.~
@50 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>! The term grave robber has such unsavory connotations. I prefer to think of myself as a tomb raider, if you will.~
@51 = ~When I heard Aarin Gend was seeking the Words of Power I came to offer my expertise in this area. Gend has a reputation for rewarding his allies well.~
@52 = ~Maybe it's just the wine talking, but I like you. I suppose I could afford to spare a small monetary reward for the recovery of my snow globe. How does 300 gold pieces sound?~
@53 = ~Deal.~
@54 = ~Forget it.~
@55 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but by rights the snow globe is mine. I will not pay to have my own property returned to me. Besides, I know how badly Aarin Gend desires the Words of Power. If you want to recover it for him you will give me the snow globe.~ 
@56 = ~Never fear, <CHARNAME>. I have merely transitioned the snow globe to its pedestal in my room here at the inn using the command word. Had I done this before, Nax could not have stolen it from me. But it seems I was a little... tipsy that night. The wine was somewhat stronger than I anticipated.~ 
@57 = ~But, as I've already told you, <CHARNAME>, I know the location of one of the Words of Power, and I will be happy to share this information with you as soon as you get my snow globe back from Nax. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?~ 
@58 = ~I don't have time to look for your snow globe. I need to find the Words of Power right now!~
@59 = ~The truth is they could be anywhere... though I believe I have learned the location of one of the Words, after many years of research and study.~
@60 = ~Where can I find this Word?~
@61 = ~And of course I was interested in recruiting someone to recover my snow globe from Nax, as I have already explained to you.~
@62 = ~And I was also hoping to find some brave adventurer, some intrepid, would-be hero, who might aid me in a little task.~
@63 = ~Task? What kind of task?~
@64 = ~As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I doubt the snow globe you have is the one I need, anyway. And if it is, I will be here waiting for you when you come to your senses. Remember, until you give me the snow globe you won't know where to find the Word of Power.~ 
@65 = ~Now, as I promised I will tell you how to find the Word of Power. The key, as you may have already guessed, is the snow globe itself.~

@67 = ~I don't think you appreciate the importance of this particular snow globe, <CHARNAME>. There is power locked within that glass sphere, power we cannot even begin to comprehend! Nax felt its power, even if he didn't understand it. That's why he stole the snow globe from me. But he'll never unlock its mysteries. It took me years of research to uncover the snow globe's secrets.~ 
@68 = ~As I told you before, the snow globe was stolen from me by a wizard named Nax. He told me he was going to the Coldwood in search of a long forgotten wizard's laboratory.~
@69 = ~Off you go then. Best of luck in your mission. Come back and see me if you have any more questions. That's what I'm here for, after all.~
@70 = ~Before I tell you the location of the Word of Power I need you to perform a task. Something very precious was stolen from me recently: a snow globe I had acquired on behalf of a very wealthy benefactor. If you want me to tell you what I know about the location of the Word of Power, you'll have to recover that snow globe for me.~ 
@71 = ~I can't waste my time looking for a snow globe!~
@72 = ~Where can I find the snow globe?~
@73 = ~If you know where one of the Words of Power is, you'd better tell me. I don't want this to get nasty.~
@74 = ~Something was stolen from me. A very rare and precious snow globe I had acquired on one of my archeological expeditions for a wealthy benefactor. If I could find someone to recover that snow globe for me I would be very grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I might even tell them what I know about the location of one of the Words of Power.~ 
@75 = ~Never fear, <CHARNAME>. I have merely transitioned the snow globe to its pedestal in my room here at the inn using the command word. Had I done this before, Nax could not have stolen it from me. But it seems I was a little... tipsy that night. The wine was somewhat stronger than I anticipated. Now, as I promised I will tell you how to find the Word of Power. The key, as you may have already guessed, is the snow globe itself.~ 
@76 = ~I have researched the snow globe in great detail, and I've discovered something rather interesting. Within the glass globe there exists an entire miniature world, a real world with real, living creatures!~
@77 = ~A miniature world? How is that possible?~
@78 = ~What does this have to do with the Word of Power?~
@79 = ~But all this is beside the point. If you want me to tell you where the Word of Power can be found, you'll bring me the snow globe. That alone should be incentive enough for you.~
@80 = ~Find the snow globe and I'll tell where you can find one of the Words of Power.~ 
@81 = ~I was en route to deliver the snow globe to my buyer when it was stolen from me by an unscrupulous, albeit rather charming, wizard named Nax. From what he told me, Nax was in these parts doing some research of his own. It seems he found a magical entrance to the deserted laboratory of a long dead wizard somewhere in the Coldwood to the north.~ 
@82 = ~Spare me your threats, <CHARNAME>. Aarin Gend himself has invited me here. What do you think he will do if you choose to harm me? Bring me my snow globe and I will gladly tell you what I know about the location of the Word of Power. However, until I get the snow globe the secret remains with me.~ 
@83 = ~If the ancient texts and documents I have researched are accurate, someone has hidden one of the Words of Power inside the miniature world.~
@84 = ~How can I get the Word out?~
@85 = ~I'll bet Nax is exploring that laboratory right now and with my snow globe at his side! But if you want to go after him you'll need this teleportation scroll. Nax told me it was the only way to pass through the magical portal leading to the dungeon.~
@86 = ~How did you manage to get this teleportation scroll? And why did Nax tell you all this?~
@87 = ~Based on my research, you actually have to go inside the snow globe and retrieve it. There doesn't seem to be any other way to get the Word out.~
@88 = ~Okay, get me in!~
@89 = ~Forget it, it sounds too risky.~
@90 = ~I'm a capable and attractive woman, and I'm not above using my charms to further my archeological investigations. Nax offered to buy me a few drinks, we got to talking about our respective research, one thing led to another... Afterwards, when Nax fell asleep, I borrowed the scroll and slipped off to have copies made before returning the scroll to his pack. I planned to do a little investigating of this dungeon on my own later on.~
@91 = ~The snow globe is on its pedestal in my room. Second door on the left at the top of the stairs. If you're determined to go inside, all you have to do is touch the globe and will yourself in. Whoo, that wine went right to my head! That's strong stuff! On your way out, let the bartender know I'm ready for another round.~ 
@92 = ~I can't say I blame you. I wouldn't want to risk going in there myself, even though Gend is offering a hefty reward to recover those Words of Power. I imagine that sooner or later someone is going to have to take the risk. It won't be me, however. Now that I have my snow globe back I just want to have some wine and relax!~ 
@93 = ~I've changed my mind. Get me inside the snow globe.~
@94 = ~But while I was out making copies, Nax took my snow globe! I didn't notice until he was long gone. I guess it's my own fault for leaving him asleep in my room. I don't carry a grudge against Nax for what he did. I just want the snow globe back. Deliver it to me and I'll tell you the location of one of the Words of Power.~ 

@96 = ~Whoo, that wine went right to my head! That's strong stuff! On your way out, let the bartender know I'm ready for another round.~
@97 = ~Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. I hope your search for my missing snow globe is going better than my search for a decent glass of wine in this place. Not that I don't keep trying. *hic* Oh, excuse me. Perhaps I should slow down... it wouldn't do to get tipsy now, would it?~ [NWLILL56]
