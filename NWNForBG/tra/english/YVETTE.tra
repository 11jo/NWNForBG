@0 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Why have you come in my room? I am... not entertaining, today. My heart simply wouldn't be in it.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~What's the problem?~
@3 = ~You're one of the brothel girls, then?~
@4 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~NP: My name is Yvette. I worked quite a bit at Miss Bela's place. But... I don't think I can interest you. What could you need from me?~ /*But... I'm sure I am no one that would interest you. What could you want from me?*/
@7 = ~Do you know what's going on in Luskan?~
@8 = ~I'm looking for work, if you know of any.~
@9 = ~I need some directions.~
@10 = ~NP: I... I had a baby<SIRMAAM> . From the client. I didnâ€™t want to, but it happened, and when my daughter was born, she became the only joy in my life. But father... Galron... He doesn't believe I can be a good mother. He took my daughter and will not return her. I want... I'll pay you if you give me back the baby.~ /*The father, however... Galrone... he does not believe I would make a proper mother. He took my daughter away and will not return her. I wish... I would pay you to get my child back.*/
@11 = ~I have your baby with me.~
@12 = ~Why does he want the baby?~
@13 = ~I can't just take the baby from her father, either.~
@14 = ~You think you could be a proper mother?~
@15 = ~I could help you.~
@16 = ~No, I don't want to get involved.~
@17 = ~Aye, but... I have not been for long. Miss Bela has given me leave, as well, until I... until things are sorted out. I cannot bring myself to be with anyone at the moment.~
@18 = ~NP: You don't look like a prostitute at all.~ /*You don't seem like the type.*/
@19 = ~So? I want to hire you anyway.~
@20 = ~All... all right. Ask me what you wish.~
@21 = ~I want to ask you again about getting your baby for you.~
@22 = ~Aye. Goodbye to you.~
@23 = ~I am no expert in such matters, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. The fighting has been going on for several weeks, now... it's quite horrible. I wish it would just stop.~
@24 = ~You said you would find my baby. I... don't know of anything else beyond that.~
@25 = ~I don't know my way around Luskan, myself. You might be better off asking Miss Bela... or maybe Erb. Erb could help you. You'll probably find him out in the lounge.~
@26 = ~NP: You found her! Oh thanks, thanks! How did you manage to convince Galron to let her go? Ah, what a difference! The only important thing is that she returned to me again. My gold is not enough for a reward... But that's all I can give you. I... can spend 500 gold. I... hope that's enough?~ /*You found her! Oh, thank you, thank you! How did you ever manage to convince Galrone to give her up? Oh, I don't care! All that matters is I have her back once more.*/
@27 = ~NP: No, not enough. Come on, or the baby dies!~ /*No it not enough. Give all or baby dies!*/
@28 = ~Is that all? I guess I'll take the baby back to Galrone.~
@29 = ~Keep your gold for the baby. It was my pleasure.~
@30 = ~That would be fine.~
@31 = ~NP: I don't know. Galron is an evil and... sometimes even cruel person. I don't think he would want to know about the baby, much less take it away. I dread to think what he could do to her. Please... If you return it, I will reward you.~ /*I don't know. Galrone is a haughty and... and sometimes cruel man. I didn't think he'd even want to know about the child, nevermind want it.*/
@32 = ~NP: But... it's my baby,<SIRMAAM> . I don't think Galron wants her... I think he just doesn't want people to know he has... an illegitimate child. He won't talk to me and won't let me see her. Please help me<SIRMAAM> and I'll give you all my gold.~ /*But... it's my baby, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I don't think Galrone even wants her... I think he just doesn't want it known that he has a... a bastard child.*/
@33 = ~NP: Yes, sure. Miss Bela has put aside quite a bit of the money that... I've made here. I want to leave Luskan and go home... to raise my daughter properly. I have enough money to pay you and... to provide for her well. Please, I beg you, help me!~ /*I could, I know I could. Miss Bela has put aside much of the coin I've... earned here. I want to leave Luskan and go back home... to raise my daughter proper.*/
@34 = ~NP: Oh, this is great news! Galron lives in a house to the north... Though I don't know if he's still there, given the carnage in the streets. Please do whatever it takes to get my daughter back... But don't harm Galron unnecessarily. He is, after all, the father of my child.~ /*Please do whatever you can to get my daughter back... just don't hurt Galrone, please, if you can avoid it. He... he is still my child's father.*/
@35 = ~Me want money up front to do this.~
@36 = ~I'll be right back.~
@37 = ~I see. Yes, of course you don't... that is, thank you for at least considering it. Now, if you could... leave me alone, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I'd appreciate it.~
@38 = ~I suppose. My family died before all the fighting began. Miss Bela gave me a home here... she has been very kind.~
@39 = ~Alll... all you brutes are the same! Get out of my room, please... Miss Bela gave me leave. Talk to her, if you have a problem with that.~
@40 = ~Oh, of course. What do you need to know?~
@41 = ~Is there anything else about this job you're not telling me?~
@42 = ~Please come back with my baby when you find her.~
@43 = ~Maybe Miss Bela could tell you more. She is a very smart lady.~
@44 = ~I don't know much else. Maybe Miss Bela could tell you more? She is so smart and kind... she's been so helpful with my... little problem.~
@45 = ~What problem is that?~
@46 = ~You... want a job? Maybe you could help me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I haven't anyone else to turn to... perhaps I could hire you?~
@47 = ~NP: No! You... you wouldn't dare! Then here ... take it. Take everything. I... I'll have to find another way to get her home. You are very cruel. Miss Bela will help me get out of this city and not associate with people like you anymore ... I hope I never come back here!~ /*You are a cruel, cruel <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Miss Bela has found me a way to leave this city and people like you behind... I hope I never have to return!*/
@48 = ~NP: Luskan: The prostitute's husband Yvette, a prostitute from a brothel in Luskan, dreams of a better life. With the help of Bela, the brothel owner, she hopes to move to Silverymoon and start a new life there. With the help of good adventurers, she managed to take her child away from his father Galron and now she left with a light heart for Silverymoon.~ /*Yvette, a harlot at the Luskan brothel, has dreams of a better life. With the support of Bela, the brothel's owner, she hopes to move to Silverymoon and start her life afresh. Thanks to the assistance of some kindly adventurers, she was able to retrieve her only child from her estranged husband, Galrone, and depart for Silverymoon with an easy heart.*/
@49 = ~NP: No, don't do it! I... here, I'll give you more! I won't have anything left for the baby, but I can't lose her again. You are very cruel. Miss Bela will help me get out of this city and not associate with people like you anymore ... I hope I never come back here!~ /*You are a cruel, cruel <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Miss Bela has found me a way to leave this city and people like you behind... I hope I never have to return!*/
@50 = ~Are... are you sure, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? You earned the gold, after all. The baby and I can... make do.~
@51 = ~You're right. The original reward will do.~
@52 = ~No, no, keep the gold.~
@53 = ~NP: Of course. Here's another 250 gold for you. Take it to your health.~ /*I am sure. In fact, I have 250 gp. Take it and be safe.*/
@54 = ~NP: Then take it. I don't know what I would have to do without your help. Now I have to go. Miss Bela arranged for us to be taken out of town to start life anew. Thanks again!~ /*I have to go, now. Miss Bela arranged for someone to take us out of the city, to start our lives anew. Thank you again!*/
@55 = ~I... I suppose you should know that Galrone is a very wealthy man. He has many guards, and had influence in Luskan before all this fighting started. I don't know his situation now, though.~
@56 = ~NP: You have done much more than you could hope for. Thank you,<LADYLORD> ... I will always remember your kindness. Now I have to go. Miss Bela arranged for us to be taken out of town to start life anew. Thanks again!~ /*I have to go, now. Miss Bela arranged for someone to take us out of the city, to start our lives anew. Thank you again!*/
@57 = ~NP: You are so generous, I... I don't know what to say. Gods bless you<LADYLORD> I will always remember your kindness! Now I have to go. Miss Bela arranged for us to be taken out of town to start life anew. Thanks again!~ /*I have to go, now. Miss Bela arranged for someone to take us out of the city, to start our lives anew. Thank you again!*/
@58 = ~Miss Bela warned me not to give my gold away. You... you will get a reward once I get my daughter, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I won't give it out before then.~
@59 = ~Yvette, a harlot at the Luskan brothel, has dreams of a better life. With the support of Bela, the brothel's owner, she hopes to move to Silverymoon and start her life afresh. Unable to leave without her baby, however, she has begged adventurers to help retrieve the child from her estranged husband, Galrone.~
@60 = ~You return. Is there something else I can do for you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@61 = ~You've come back? Er... what do you wish of me?~
@62 = ~You mentioned something about a job before.~
@63 = ~Have... have you found my baby? Have you any news?~
