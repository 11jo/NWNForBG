@0 = ~Eh... your skin isn't green... you don't look much like one of those ugly trolls. What are you doing here?~ [NOBFE09] 
@1 = ~I am clearing the trolls and ogres out of these caves. Who are you and why are you here?~
@2 = ~You're Revat's Momma right? I am here to rescue you.~
@3 = ~You can stop worrying. I'm here to rescue you.~
@4 = ~The trolls are gone, you are free to go, but not with me. You can leave on your own.~
@5 = ~Just stay right there and don't move. I'll be back.~
@6 = ~My name is Janis and I was a prisoner of those monsters. Well, kind of a prisoner.~
@7 = ~What do you mean 'kind of' a prisoner?~
@8 = ~Well, the trolls guarding you are dead, so you can go.~
@9 = ~My name is Janis. Hope you can learn that better than my boy.~
@10 = ~Sorry, he never said your name.~
@11 = ~Since I am here to rescue you, you might want to be more polite.~
@12 = ~I'm afraid it's not that easy. Why don't I just tell you the whole story? It's easier to explain that way. You see, I am a mage of no small accomplishment, but I also am fascinated by archeology. I was with a troop of archeologists and we were exploring these caves. I became interested in an unusual pattern on the cave walls and accidentally became separated from the others. Then I heard the screams.~ 
@13 = ~The others were attacked by the trolls and ogres, right?~
@14 = ~So what did you do?~
@15 = ~Are you telling me what to do? However, there is nothing else left for me.~ 
@16 = ~Why don't I just tell you the whole story? It's easier to explain that way. You see, I am a mage of no small accomplishment, but I also am fascinated by archeology. I was with a troop of archeologists and we were exploring these caves. I became interested in an unusual pattern on the cave walls and accidentally became separated from the others. Then I heard the screams.~ 
@17 = ~Not too bright are you? I just hope you have more manners than those slobbering trolls.~
@18 = ~Are you always this miserable?~
@19 = ~So why didn't they kill you, or eat you?~
@20 = ~You haven't saved me yet. I'll thank you when you have. Not too bright are you? I just hope you have more manners than those slobbering trolls.~ 
@21 = ~Figured that out all by yourself, eh?~
@22 = ~Don't interrupt. No respect for your elders, that's the problem with your generation.~
@23 = ~Only when I've gone without food or water for a couple of days.~
@24 = ~By the time I got back to where they were, everyone had either been killed, or had fled. I was very concerned for my son Revat. He is a little slow of mind. In a quick glimpse I noticed that his body wasn't on the ground. Then the largest troll I have ever seen came back into the cave. He seemed surprised to see me, which was all that saved me. He started to hoot and shout to the others, then came bounding across the floor.~ 
@25 = ~I began to cast a spell, but the sight of the blood on his claws caused me to slip in the incantation. I had meant to encase him in Otiluke's Resilient Sphere, a very rare, but useful spell.~
@26 = ~Then what happened?~
@27 = ~Is this story going to take much longer?~
@28 = ~The spell sucked back on me and trapped me in a form-fitting, impenetrable force field. I couldn't move, but the trolls couldn't hurt me either. They were so impressed, I think they thought I was a goddess.~
@29 = ~A goddess? Why do you think that?~
@30 = ~Somebody's going senile, I think.~
@31 = ~Have a little patience. I'm almost done.~
@32 = ~There is enough room in this 'shell' for me to talk. When I could talk, but they couldn't hurt me, they started bowing down and bringing me gifts. Not that I could accept them, but they brought them anyway.~
@33 = ~Watch your tongue young <MANWOMAN>. There is no excuse for being disrespectful to your elders.~ 
@34 = ~I see that you have the ring from Revat. If you would just touch me with the ring, it should negate the spell.~
@35 = ~How will it do that?~
@36 = ~All right, here's the ring.~
@37 = ~I've changed my mind. I think I'll keep the ring.~
@38 = ~So now I get to the worst part. Even though you have killed all of the trolls and ogres, I can't get free. I don't know how long the spell will last, but I'm going to die if I don't get out of here soon.~
@39 = ~So how am I supposed to help you?~
@40 = ~What do you expect me to do about it?~
@41 = ~The ring has a one-time cancellation spell on it. I created it to protect Revat from spellcasters who might seek to harm me by harming my child.~
@42 = ~Oh, please don't do that! I will die without it. I beg you.~
@43 = ~No. I will keep it and you will die. Goodbye.~
@44 = ~I need you to find Revat. He has a ring that was his father's. The ring has a one-time cancellation spell on it. I created it to protect Revat from spellcasters who might seek to harm me by harming my child.~
@45 = ~Where would I find your son?~
@46 = ~I'm busy now, but maybe later.~
@47 = ~I lost the ring, wait here.~ 
@48 = ~What do I look like, somebody's weak, old granny? I'm a powerful mage and I can make my own way back, now that the spell is broken.~
@49 = ~What do you think I am, senile? Of course I know the way is clear. I can make it back on my own, and I don't need you to tell me so.~
@50 = ~My death is on your soul. You have doomed me.~
@51 = ~We had some outbuildings on the surface near here. He would have stayed there worrying about me. You had better go quickly; the thirst is starting to get to me.~
@52 = ~I will surely be dead later. Please, I know I was short-tempered with you, but don't let me die. I beg you.~
@53 = ~Okay. Where would I find your son.~
@54 = ~Sorry. Maybe someone else will come along.~
@55 = ~Not that I don't appreciate what you did, but you could have been a little faster about it. See you on the surface.~
@56 = ~Oh, thank you. That feels better. Well? What are you standing around, wasting time for? Don't you have other things you should be doing?~
@57 = ~Don't you need help getting back to Revat?~
@58 = ~The way back is cleared of trolls; find your own way out.~
@59 = ~You're back, huh? You certainly took your sweet time. Well?~
@60 = ~Could you explain what happened to you again?~
@61 = ~You can come with me now.~
@62 = ~You're just not worth rescuing. Goodbye.~
@63 = ~I'm afraid it's not that easy. I need you to find Revat. He has a ring that was his father's. The ring has a one-time cancellation spell on it. I created it to protect Revat from spellcasters who might seek to harm me by harming my child. Only with this ring will I be able to get out of the Otiluke's Resilient Sphere.~ 
@64 = ~Talk to Revat, he will reward you for saving me. You be good. Come visit us in Waterdeep and I'll bake you some cookies.~ 
@65 = ~Well, thank you again for the assistance, try to stay safe. My son and I are going to Waterdeep.~
@66 = ~You came back in time, a little more and I would have died. Will you save me?~ 
@67 = ~I wouldn't think of it.~
