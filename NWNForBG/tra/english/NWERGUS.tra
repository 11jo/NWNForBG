@0 = ~Greetings. Come to join the legions of the damned, have you? The Beggar's Nest be the closest thing to the Hells on Faerun. Zombies are everywhere. I advise caution, my friend. You look like you might have potential, and there's been enough death here already.~ /*Zombies are everywhere. I advise caution, my friend. You look like you might have potential, and there's been enough death here already.*/
@1 = ~How bad is it getting in this district?~
@2 = ~Are there any safe locations?~
@3 = ~Have you heard anything about Waterdhavian creatures?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Bad enough, though the man I thought I had lost made it back. Thanks to you if you had anything to do with it. He'll help us pick off the undead from here.~
@6 = ~Bad enough that I won't lose another guard in a hopeless fight. Let the undead walk. We'll pick them off from fortified places like the gate here. We're okay if we stay barricaded, but damnation, why did they have to start burning corpses upwind. Ugh! And why did the dead have to start getting restless?~ /*We're okay if we stay barricaded, but damnation, why did they have to start burning corpses upwind. Ugh! And why did the dead have to start getting restless?*/
@7 = ~You lost a guard? Who was it?~
@8 = ~Is there a reason for the undead infestation?~
@9 = ~Back to my previous questions.~
@10 = ~A couple, I suppose, but it depends on what you call safe. I don't put much stock in what some people are spouting.~
@11 = ~So who would you trust? Where is the safest place?~
@12 = ~You don't agree with some people's methods of helping?~
@13 = ~Aribeth got you hunting for those? I was briefed by Lady Aribeth but she didn't tell me much about it. Nothing useful, anyway. They were for a spell or something, right? Bah! I won't risk my men on a scavenger hunt. Search if you want. Nothing to do with me.~ /*They were for a spell or something, right? Bah! I won't risk my men on a scavenger hunt. Search if you want. Nothing to do with me.*/
@14 = ~I'd get yourself to the Shining Serpent. There's too many undead... and some citizens are just as vicious.~
@15 = ~We're okay if we stay barricaded, but damnation, why did they have to start burning corpses upwind. Ugh! And why did the dead have to start getting restless?~
@16 = ~A promising young guard named Walters. A local boy that grew up in the Beggar's Nest. A shame... He worked hard... He pulled himself up, he did, and didn't join a gang like most his of friends. Now he's probably dead to a zombie.~ /*A promising young guard named Walters. A local boy that grew up in the Beggar's Nest. A shame... He worked hard...*/
@17 = ~Where did you see him last?~
@18 = ~If there is a reason behind any of this, nobody is telling me. First the plague, and now this. I got no answers.~
@19 = ~Ask what you will.~
@20 = ~Last I saw he was heading out to patrol. Couldn't tell him not to. He's got old friends in this district, I guess. He usually patrols near the northeast end of the Nest. Even without the zombies there's some shady types over there.~ /*Last I saw he was heading out to patrol. Couldn't tell him not to. He's got old friends in this district, I guess.*/
@21 = ~You'll be looking for Harben Ashensmith. He knows what's what. Probably at the Shining Serpent, the safest place in the district. It's in the south central area of the Nest. That's where I'd go. Bunch of realists, looking for solid ways to survive.~ /*It's in the south central area of the Nest. That's where I'd go. Bunch of realists, looking for solid ways to survive.*/
@22 = ~It's not for me to say. If you want a safe location, I'll tell you about the sanctuary Desther's Helmites set up in the southwest. I'll also tell you, however, that I wouldn't go there. Sure, the zombies avoid it, but I just don't put much stock in them Helmite blessings.~ /*I'll also tell you, however, that I wouldn't go there. Sure, the zombies avoid it, but I just don't put much stock in them Helmite blessings.*/
@23 = ~Myself, I prefer a sword in my hand to some foolish hope in my head. I'd recommend you talk to Harben Ashensmith in the Shining Serpent instead.~
@24 = ~Don't know what's been happening, but the undead have dropped off completely. Not much for us to do here now.~
@25 = ~Don't even have to worry about my missing man. Walters made it back in one piece! Thanks to you if you had anything to do with that. The plague is still a concern, of course, but there are things being done elsewhere for that. I just hope I don't get used to the stink of burning dead before we beat it. Ugh...~ /*The plague is still a concern, of course, but there are things being done elsewhere for that. I just hope I don't get used to the stink of burning dead before we beat it. Ugh...*/
@26 = ~It was a Yuan-Ti named Gulnan who caused it all.~
@27 = ~The Beggar's Nest should be fine now.~
@28 = ~The plague is still a concern, of course, but there are things being done elsewhere for that. I just hope I don't get used to the stink of burning dead before we beat it. Ugh...~
@29 = ~A Yuan-Ti? Well what the hell was one of those doing in Neverwinter? Wait... was that one of the Waterdhavian beasts brought in? Damn them all! I know we need a cure and all, but I lost good men to that zombie horde. Blast it, who let that snake beast loose? I'd better get some answers when I file my report.~ /*I know we need a cure and all, but I lost good men to that zombie horde. Blast it, who let that snake beast loose? I'd better get some answers when I file my report.*/
@30 = ~I should hope so. You took a big risk wandering around in there. It could have turned out much worse. Thanks for all your effort.~
@31 = ~Good luck to you, wherever duty takes you. Make sure you keep Aribeth apprised of what you've found.~
