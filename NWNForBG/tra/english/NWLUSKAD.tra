@0 = ~Best be turning back, traveler. Luskan's gates are closed.~
@1 = ~Why are the gates closed?~
@2 = ~Let me through the gates... now.~
@3 = ~All right, I'll be going.~
@4 = ~The gates are closed to make certain that the plague in Neverwinter doesn't spread to Luskan, <SIRMAAM>. Can't be too careful.~
@5 = ~But the plague in Neverwinter has been cured.~
@6 = ~I'm sure there's some way to get inside the city.~
@7 = ~Is that supposed to be some kind of threat? Even if you cut us down, they still won't open the gates for you, fool.~
@8 = ~I'm going through those gates - and you!~
@9 = ~You seem a little dirty... Perhaps a stay at the Green Griffon would liven your spirit. At the worst, you'd have a place to stay for now. Farewell.~
@10 = ~Ha! Whether you speak the truth or not, we would not so easily open up our doors. We are many things but gullible isn't one of them. Aside from that, there are simply too many internal problems facing Luskan at the moment. You would be better off turning around and going back whence you came.~ /*Ha! Whether you speak the truth or not, we would not so easily open up our doors. We are many things but gullible isn't one of them.*/
@11 = ~What sorts of "internal problems?"~
@12 = ~You're welcome to look, though I'm sure you'll find our city to be quite heavily fortified. I doubt a rat could get through this quarantine.~
@13 = ~Are you insane? I told you, THE GATE IS CLOSED!~
@14 = ~Listen, why are you continuing down this line of questioning? Luskan isn't a safe city, there's plague looming all around us. Need you more information than that? But rest assured, things will return to normal sooner or later. The gates will be open, and you may enter into Luskan then.~ /*Listen, why are you continuing down this line of questioning? Luskan isn't a safe city, there's plague looming all around us. Need you more information than that?*/
@15 = ~Perhaps I can help the city.~
@16 = ~How about an offer, for the "city," of 300 gold?~ /**/
@17 = ~I doubt that, <SIRMAAM>. Come back later when the problem has cleared.~
@18 = ~And get into all sorts of trouble with the sergeant? No thanks, <SIRMAAM>... the gate's being too closely watched. Best you just come back when this is all sorted out.~
@19 = ~Hmmm... by your description, I think you're the one the sergeant wants to speak to, <SIRMAAM>.~
@20 = ~I don't know how you convinced the sergeant, but if he says it's okay, go on through. Luskan's a dangerous place right now, but it's your neck to risk.~
@21 = ~I'll tell you right now, though... you go inside the city, we ain't letting you back out. In or out, one or the other.~
