@0 = ~What do you want? Sorry, I'm in a foul temper today. How can I help you?~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~NP: My name is Lenton. So, back to the question - what do you need?~ /*Fine. So like I said, what do you want?*/
@5 = ~What's put you in this mood?~
@6 = ~You're certainly miserable.~
@7 = ~NP: You know, Ill probably try to answer. Just dont mess with me anymore.~ /*I guess I'll try. Don't waste my time though.*/
@8 = ~What's your name?~
@9 = ~What's going on here?~
@10 = ~Why are you in such a bad mood?~
@11 = ~Ya, bye.~
@12 = ~How about we start with creator-race-obsessed Jax and his stupid expedition to find ruins that don't exist.~
@13 = ~NP: Do you think ruins dont exist?~ /*You don't think the ruins exist?*/
@14 = ~You're miserable. I'm done talking to you.~
@15 = ~Maybe before you judge people, you ought to find out if they have a reason for being upset.~
@16 = ~Nothing! We're all just standing around doing nothing. I can't stand it anymore.~
@17 = ~What exactly can't you stand?~
@18 = ~NP: I used to think they were. Jax has really screwed my brains out. But we searched the place cave by cave. And you know what we found?~ /*Oh, I did. Jax had me totally convinced. But we searched through cavern after cavern. And you know what we found?*/
@19 = ~Nothing?~
@20 = ~I have no idea.~
@21 = ~Fine. That actually improves my day!~
@22 = ~Blast! I wish we had found nothing.~
@23 = ~We found trolls! And ogres! Hordes of trolls and their pet ogres. No ancient creatures, no tombs, no tomes, just trolls and ogres. We were studying this unusual rock formation, because Jax thought it might be special. But it wasn't. Suddenly I hear this scream.~ /*We were studying this unusual rock formation, because Jax thought it might be special. But it wasn't. Suddenly I hear this scream.*/
@24 = ~I turned around and there's this huge troll holding my brother, Drokas, by one leg. It dangles him upside down and then... it bites his head off.~
@25 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. That's horrible.~
@26 = ~Guess you should have been paying better attention.~
@27 = ~I don't need your pity! I need your help. The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you're supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us. Only a few of us escaped from those caves. I want someone to go back there and wipe out every one of those trolls. Especially the big one.~ /*The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you're supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us.*/
@28 = ~What would you be willing to pay to have these trolls and ogres wiped out?~
@29 = ~That sounds like an important job. I'll do it.~
@30 = ~I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@31 = ~You're exactly the kind of person I need to help me get revenge. The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you're supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us. Only a few of us escaped from those caves. I want someone to go back there and wipe out every one of those trolls. Especially the big one.~ /*The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you're supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us.*/
@32 = ~All I can afford to pay you is 300 gold. That's all I have left after this fool's errand. So what do you think?~
@33 = ~Excellent. Bring me the troll Chieftain's head and I will pay you 300 gold.~

@35 = ~Like I should be surprised. If you decide to develop a backbone, just come back here.~
@36 = ~I see you are back again. Have you changed your mind about killing those trolls?~
@37 = ~What do you want done again?~
@38 = ~I have the troll's head right here.~
@39 = ~NP: My mind has changed, I will kill these trolls.~ /*I've changed my mind, I'll hunt the trolls for you.*/
@40 = ~No. I'm still not interested.~
@41 = ~Oh for pity's sake. All right, do you need the whole story again, or just a summary?~
@42 = ~The whole thing.~
@43 = ~A summary.~
@44 = ~Finally! My brother is avenged. I am very impressed with your skill. I will take that off your hands and burn it with pleasure. I wish I had more gold to pay you, but 300 is all I have. Sorry there isn't more.~ /*I will take that off your hands and burn it with pleasure. I wish I had more gold to pay you, but 300 is all I have. Sorry there isn't more.*/
@45 = ~I need no reward. Avenging a life and slaying evil is reward enough.~
@46 = ~As we agreed, that will be fine.~
@47 = ~You had better find some more, or I'll make you look like this troll.~
@48 = ~Then why are you bothering me? Don't talk to me unless you want to hunt some trolls.~
@49 = ~I want you to go down into the caves and kill all of the trolls. Then bring me back the big guy's head. So, are you up for the job?~ /*I want you to go down into the caves and kill all of the trolls. Then bring me back the big guy's head.*/
@50 = ~Sure.~
@51 = ~No, I'm not interested.~
@52 = ~NP: You -<MALEFEMALE> great nobility. I will tell everyone I know about your exploits.~ /*You are an honorable <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I shall tell everyone I know of your heroic deeds.*/

@54 = ~NP: Very good. Well, all the best to you in the future.~ /*Very well. Good luck to you in the future. I am off.*/
@55 = ~I guess I should have expected such a comment from your type. You can threaten all you want. You won't find anymore money on my corpse. Here is the 500 gold, as I promised earlier.~ /*I guess I should have expected such a comment from your type. You can threaten all you want. You won't find anymore money on my corpse.*/
@56 = ~So you're back. Do you have the head of the troll chieftain yet?~
@57 = ~NP: Once again, what should I do?~ /*What me do again?*/
@58 = ~NP: I have a troll head.~ /*I have Guzud's head.*/
@59 = ~I'm working on it.~
@60 = ~Oh, for pity's sake! I want you to go down into the caves and kill the trolls. Bring back the big troll's head. Now, get going and finish the job.~ /*Oh, for pity's sake! I want you to go down into the caves and kill the trolls. Bring back the big troll's head.*/
@61 = ~All right, well keep trying. I'll be waiting.~
@62 = ~NP: Thank you, now my brother is avenged.~ /*Thank you, Aarin. I shall keep it safe.*/
@63 = ~NP: What do you need? Our business is over, dont bother me anymore.~ /*Then be gone and bother me no more.*/
