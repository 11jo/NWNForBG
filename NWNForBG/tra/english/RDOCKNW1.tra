@0 = ~MT: Beware of going down into the sewers at the docks - I've heard stories of some crazy people.~ /*The chicken launches into a story about how it had been very much startled by a stick the previous day.*/
@1 = ~MT: Things are kind of stalled these days, and then there's this auction at Sidi's tavern.~ /*How me get in Seedy Tavern black market?*/
@2 = ~MT: I heard that there was a split among the bloody sailors who settled in this region. Some support Vengaul, while others have defected to Kallik.~ /*She was a hero of our people, once. Until she fell and betrayed us to Morag.*/
@3 = ~MT: Jerol, the owner of the Twenty-in-Quiver shop, accepts smugglers' coins for some reason, what a fool! You can't buy anything with these coins in other parts of the city anyway.~ /*He's the owner of the Twenty in a Quiver market. You'll find it east of here, on the way to the other side of the district.*/
@4 = ~MT: Vengaul spread rumors that one of the ingredients for the pestilence cure would be up for auction. It seems the auction has been cancelled, I know why.~ /*I don't spread rumors. Besides, Meldanen is not known for his patience or gentle business acumen. I do not wish to be on his bad side.*/
@5 = ~MT: Lieutenant Kallik is an impatient and greedy man... Perhaps he has taken... some measures to get rid of the leaders of the bloody sailors of old Vengaul.~ /*I don't know. I have heard rumblings... His lieutenant Callik is an impatient and greedy man... I can't say much more about this.*/
@6 = ~MT: There are several places in the dock area where you can go down into the sewers, but I do not advise you to go there. Bloody sailors run everything there, and you wonâ€™t have time to die before you become a dead man.~ /*Hmm? I think it was in the far northeast corner of the district. I wouldn't go poking around there, though. Not unless you want trouble.*/
@7 = ~MT: If you meet priests of Helm on the street, don't trust them. All these blessings of theirs are worth nothing, and the priests themselves are somehow suspicious.~ /*If you are threatening me to get gold, someone already beat you to it. I've nothing, no matter what you do. Just ask your questions and go.*/
