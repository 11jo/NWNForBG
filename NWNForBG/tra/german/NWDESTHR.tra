@0 = ~I can spare no time for your idle chatter, <CHARNAME>. I must coordinate the search of my Helmites as they try to recover the missing Waterdhavian creatures... thanks to Aribeth!~ [NWDES102]
@1 = ~This is in addition to all our other duties: tending to the dead, comforting the sick, spreading our blessings and giving hope to the people of Neverwinter.~ [NWDES103]
@2 = ~This is a mistake, Fenthick. We know nothing about this <RACE>! How can you so blindly trust <HIMHER>?~ [NWDES070]
@3 = ~And I still say we should put our faith in my Helmite brethren, rather than an unproven <GIRLBOY>.~
@4 = ~Such callous disregard for the suffering of others! Is this the kind of mercenary we want working for us, Fenthick?~
@5 = ~The attack on the Academy in these past weeks will only make things worse, Fenthick - once people learn how Aribeth lost the cure through her lack of faith!~
@6 = ~Our faith protects us! Only the faithless need fear the Wailing Death, as I and my Helmites have proclaimed many times.~
@7 = ~The panic will get worse when people learn of the attack on the Academy and how Aribeth lost the cure.~
@8 = ~Tell <CHARNAME> the truth, Fenthick! Aribeth had the cure and she lost it because she trusted those at the Academy over my Helmite brethren!~
@9 = ~You let your feelings for her cloud your judgment, Fenthick. Your lover is not without her flaws.~
@10 = ~<HESHE> speaks as if I am not even in the room! No matter, I am too busy to waste my time chatting with you, anyway.~
@11 = ~What could be worse than the Wailing Death, Fenthick? I fear <CHARNAME> is playing a trick on you with this so called 'evidence' of some grand conspiracy!~
@12 = ~This is no trick!~
@13 = ~Why would I do such a thing?~
@14 = ~So you say. But anyone can write up a note, <CHARNAME>! Perhaps you thought you could use this slip of paper to pry a reward from Fenthick!~
@15 = ~Perhaps this is some kind of sick joke on your part, <CHARNAME>. Or maybe you thought to get some kind of reward for this flimsy piece of paper?~
@16 = ~The plague is a trial sent by the Gods to test our faith, not part of some secret plot to overthrow Neverwinter. Chasing these conspiracy theories is a waste of time!~
@17 = ~Fenthick should follow every lead if he wants to find out who's behind this.~
@18 = ~What's the matter, Desther? Do you have something to hide?~
@19 = ~How dare you accuse me - after all I have done for this city! You see what kind of people your Lady Aribeth prefers to work with, Fenthick?~
@20 = ~Before you launch a time consuming investigation into some mysterious cult, Fenthick, you might want more evidence. For all we know this note is a fake.~
@21 = ~Say, Desther - you Helmites are kind of like a cult, aren't you?~
@22 = ~A cult could have both the organization and the determination to be behind this.~
@23 = ~The note is real, Desther!~
@24 = ~How dare you! I will not be slandered by these baseless accusations! Show me your proof or I will demand you be held for inciting false rumors!~
@25 = ~So you claim. But we have only your word on that, <CHARNAME>. Maybe you plan to sell trinkets to ward off the evil magic of this imaginary cult. You would not be the first to exploit the panic for personal gain.~ 
@26 = ~*Everybody* knew the Academy was being used to house the Waterdhavian creatures, Fenthick - even the students themselves had heard the rumors! The attack was the result of gossip and loose lips from those Aribeth chose to trust instead of my faithful Helmites. We will be wasting our time looking for this phantom spy!~ 
@27 = ~You knew the creatures were at the Academy, didn't you Desther?~
@28 = ~The attackers knew enough to go straight to where the creatures were being held.~
@29 = ~This information is still worth investigating.~
@30 = ~So did Fenthick! So did Aribeth! So did every single student within the Academy walls! I do not like what you are suggesting, <CHARNAME>.~
@31 = ~What good is one creature to us, Fenthick? It is like a sword with no blade. Would you go into battle armed only with the hilt of a sword?~ [NWDES075]
@32 = ~Perhaps... but I will put my faith in Helm and my brethren rather than this <RACE> of Aribeth's.~
@33 = ~Two creatures out of four, Fenthick. Half a cure is as worthless as half a horse!~ [NWDES077]
@34 = ~Hope? My Helmites spread hope and blessings throughout the city, Fenthick. We also search for the lost creatures. Only we do not seek glory like this <RACE>.~
@35 = ~We are still missing the final creature, Fenthick. By now it may be forever beyond our grasp. Without all four creatures there will be no cure.~ [NWDES079]
@36 = ~I and my Helmite brethren prefer to remain true in our faith, Fenthick - unlike some. We seek answers from the divine Helm, not a mortal like this <RACE>.~ [DESTH080]
@37 = ~Lord Nasher made a mistake when he appointed Aribeth to be in charge of finding a cure for the plague. My Helmites are better equipped to deal with this crisis of faith. People should put their faith in the Gods - not in Lady Aribeth.~ [NWDES104] 
@38 = ~Aribeth trusted the Academy to protect the Waterdhavian creatures rather than relying on my Helmites, or even her own god, Tyr. The results of her actions are plain for all to see, yet even now she would rather trust a <RACE> such as you than rely on my Helmites!~ [NWDES106] 
@39 = ~You should spend your time more productively, <CHARNAME>. Instead of speaking with me you should be out looking for the missing Waterdhavian creatures. I suspect my Helmite brethren will prove far more useful in this task than a mere <RACE>, but who am I to defy the desires of Lady Aribeth?~ [NWDES108]
@40 = ~Had Aribeth delivered the Waterdhavian creatures to my Helmites, news of their arrival would not have spread so quickly through the city. We could have kept their location secret and prevented the tragedy that befell the Academy.~ [NWDES110]
