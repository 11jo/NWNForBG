@0 = ~NP: Uh, hi. I'm afraid you're, uh. uh. "mistaken." Mistook an unlocked door as an invitation to enter. I'm sorry if that misled you; it was not my intention to allow any stranger from the street into the house. Please accept my apologies, but I would be most grateful if you would leave. My husband is one of the guards, and I think he would be concerned if he returned to find people walking around his house.~ /*But Rolgan cannot stay in the Temple forever. I am trying to arrange a fair trial for the young man, but his Uthgardt friends are unfamiliar with our justice system... and none of the Lords' Alliance mercenaries wants to defend him during the trial.*/
@1 = ~NP: I don't mean to be rude, but you entered my house without permission. I don't think an unlocked door is an invitation. Go away, or my husband will escort you out when he returns from guard duty.~ /*Of course.  I had hoped for better from you in these troubled times, but I see that you will stick to your mercenary ways, even when we need you most.*/
@2 = ~NP: You seem very foolish to enter this house uninvited. You had better go, for if I call the guards, my husband will probably be one of them. And he will be sure to remove you from his house with the utmost-- vigor.~ /*Besides, I guarantee that their lives would be far better out here than if they remained in Thay proper. I do not mistreat my slaves; it is not economical.*/
@3 = ~NP: My husband should be here soon; I think you'd better go.~ /*Why does it have to be those specific three victims?*/
@4 = ~NP: I wish I could run away with you, darling, but my husband can be so jealous. We shouldn't make him angry. Take this ring, it'll keep you from forgetting me.~ /*Why can't you? Why can't someone else come up with the answers for once? Why is it up to me to keep swinging at the wall?*/
@5 = ~NP: Get away from me!~ /*Get away from me!*/
@6 = ~NP: And I told you my husband would be here soon!~ /*You mean we is going to lose?*/
