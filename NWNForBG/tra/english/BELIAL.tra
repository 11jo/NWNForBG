@0 = ~Karlat, is that you?... Wait! What do you want of Belial, mortal?~
@1 = ~Speak quickly <PRO_RACE> fool. Your magic protections will not last long in this place. What do you require of the Fire Lord?~
@2 = ~I command you to give me an item of the greatest power!~
@3 = ~I come as the Judge and demand only answers.~
@4 = ~NP: I had already been commanded that way, it was the mortal Karlat Jareg... I gave him a phylactery in which his soul could rest, free from the threat of mortals. I had my reasons for passing it on to him. I don't see any benefit from you. Choose again, but be wiser.~ /*I was commanded so once before, by the mortal Karlat Jhareg... To him I gave a phylactery where his soul could rest, safe from mortal threat.*/
@5 = ~I require the assistance of a magic item!~
@6 = ~NP: Take this and go away.~ /*I'll take that, thank you.*/
@7 = ~You, fleshling? You are the Judge? Then my charade is over for you command me as none other has before...~
@8 = ~You're trapped here too, aren't you...~
@9 = ~Then tell me the tale of the brothers Jhareg...~
@10 = ~Argue your guilt or innocence while you still can...~
@11 = ~What charade do you speak of?~
@12 = ~Were you a witness or a participant in this crime?~
@13 = ~NP: Yes, Judge. I didn't expect Lathander to interfere with my deal with this wizard. Like ghosts and mortals, I am bound to this place... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*Yes, my Judge. I had not bargained on Lathander's intervention in my dealings with the wizard. Like the ghosts and mortals, I am bound unto this place...*/
@14 = ~Tell me more...~
@15 = ~Get to the story.~
@16 = ~NP: Let the brethren tell their own story, Judge. I'll tell you mine... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*You see, it was I who first planted the seed of slaughter in Karlat's mind. He was but a weapon and it was my hand that controlled him.*/
@17 = ~NP: We are all guilty, my judge, and all are innocent, except for one being... It is I. You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*You see, it was I who first planted the seed of slaughter in Karlat's mind. He was but a weapon and it was my hand that controlled him.*/
@18 = ~NP: I am Belial, prince of demons! How could one believe that such a simple spell could summon me? No, I had my own reasons for responding to Karlat Jareg's call, Judge... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*I am Belial, prince of demons! Did you believe that such a simple spell would summon me? No, I answered Karlat Jhareg's call for my own reasons, Judge...*/
@19 = ~NP: Where does the crime begin? Where does it end? Crime is not an event! It's just a thread woven into the fabric... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*Where does the crime begin? Where does it end? A crime is not an event! It is a thread that must be followed through the weave...*/
@20 = ~NP: Quintus was the tool of the tool, the slave of the servant. It was he who brought the children to the castle, and Karlat cast a spell that killed them ... It was me, it was I who kept silent about the fact that this murder does not make sense. It was not needed for the Carlat ritual... but I told him otherwise...~ /*It was I, alone, who stayed silent in the knowledge that the slaughter held no meaning. Karlat's ritual did not require it... but I chose to tell him otherwise...*/
@21 = ~Then it was you behind the slaughter!?~
@22 = ~But why did you do this?~
@23 = ~Why are you telling me this so openly?~
@24 = ~Will you give this as your written oath?~
@25 = ~Very well. Quint gathered the children and Karlat killed them... But it was I who told Karlat the deed was required, though I knew it was not.~
@26 = ~I am Belial, Prince of Demons, Lord of Fire, Scourge of the Abyssal Depths... Were you ever fool enough to expect another?~
@27 = ~Thus is the nature of demons, Judge. Why is there needless suffering in the world? Why is there injustice and strife and tyranny? It is because of us...~
@28 = ~NP: First, Lathander bound everyone in this castle and submitted to the will of the judge. Second, how are you going to punish the demon? The abyss is my home, and I yearn for the sea of flame in which I once roamed.~ /*For another, how do you intend to punish a demon? The Abyss is home to me and I long to walk once more upon its sea of flames.*/
@29 = ~If it means an end to my accursed bondage in this place, then I will gladly give it... There, take it and make of it what you will.~
@30 = ~NP: The agreement has been fulfilled. I'm out.~ /*This talk is over. Get out.*/

@32 = ~Foolish mortal, you have forgotten to cast your protection charm! Belial shall rule!~

@34 = ~Does Lathander have sudden need of my services, Lady Guardian?~
@35 = ~<PRO_HESHE> may very well find me guilty, m'lady, but punishing me shall be quite another matter. You hold no power over me, Guardian...~
@36 = ~Ha! Your Judge is a fool, Guardian! The court is closed, then, the case resolved. By Lathander's own decree, we are free to go... Even me!~
@37 = ~No! And be trapped in this place forever!? It cannot be!~
@38 = ~Some of my finest work, might I add. Even now, the Dark Lords ride into battle with the name of Belial, Lord of Fire, on their lips!~
