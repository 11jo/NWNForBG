@0 = ~Hail and well met, my <LADYLORD>. I understand from your pass that you are part of a delegation from Mulhorand, yes?~ [NWISLU54]
@1 = ~(Give him the pass.) Here, take a look for yourself.~
@2 = ~That seems... an excessively far distance to travel. I have been informed of no invitation made to the Mulhorandi. We certainly were not expecting you.~
@3 = ~You dare question me?!~
@4 = ~Does the tower inform you of all their guests?~
@5 = ~You will let me in before I grow... angry.~
@6 = ~Fine, I'll just kill you now.~
@7 = ~Err... of course not, my <LADYLORD>. Tempus knows the wizards have been getting enough visitors since the fighting stopped. Allow me to open the door for you, then.~ 
@8 = ~Keeping the security of the tower is one of my duties, my <LADYLORD>. I am only doing what I must.~
@9 = ~Well... most of the time they do, aye. Since the chaos of the battles in the tower, things have grown lax, but still...~
@10 = ~There's no need for you to get upset, my <LADYLORD>... it just strikes me as odd, is all.~
@11 = ~What?! How did you get across the bridge?! Intruders in the tower!!~
@12 = ~Mulhorand... I have met several people from your land. They were dark-skinned and dressed rather extravagantly. You... look nothing like them.~
@13 = ~I am the Mulhorandi ambassador, I assure you.~
@14 = ~Are you refusing me entry?~
@15 = ~That's it. You're a dead man.~
@16 = ~Fair enough. I am not about to question the pass, at any rate. Tempus knows the wizards have been getting enough visitors. Allow me to open the door for you, then. I suggest you take the empty suite just inside the door on the right, my <LADYLORD>. You will have to wait with the other ambassadors for someone to come and get you.~ 
@17 = ~The wizards have been getting plenty of visitors... representatives from throughout the north, in fact. None from such a far off place as Mulhorand, however. How conveniently difficult to verify.~
@18 = ~Perhaps you should ask your wizards, then.~
@19 = ~I... suppose not, no. The mages have been notoriously difficult for me to contact since the fighting ceased, anyway, and your seal is legitimate. Tempus knows they've received enough visitors as of late. Allow me to open the door for you, then. I suggest you take the empty suite just inside the door on the right, my <LADYLORD>. You will have to wait with the other ambassadors for someone to come and get you.~ 
@20 = ~I warn you now that it may be awhile before anyone comes. A new Archmage Arcane was appointed after the fighting in the tower, but I understand things are still quite chaotic. I would also suggest that you not venture past the main chamber. The fighting may be over, but the wizards would mistake you for an intruder if you went where you were not permitted. Right now they are in no mood to ask questions. I'm sure you understand.~ 
@21 = ~I have some questions.~
@22 = ~Excellent. Now you die.~
@23 = ~Goodbye.~
@24 = ~Hmph. The mages have been difficult to contact since the fighting ceased. Your seal is legitimate... and Tempus knows there's been enough strange visitors as of late.~
@25 = ~I suppose there's no harm in it. Go ahead and ask.~ 
@26 = ~Who is this new Archmage Arcane?~
@27 = ~You mentioned fighting...?~
@28 = ~Tell me about the Host Tower.~
@29 = ~Fare you well, my <LADYLORD>.~ 
@30 = ~Well, the Archmage used to be Arklem Greeth. He's gone, now, and while I know someone's taken his place, I don't know who that is.~
@31 = ~The former Archmage is dead?~
@32 = ~Aye, I suppose you outsiders wouldn't know much about it, would you? The wizards were killing each other in the tower up until recently. I don't know what started it, and I'm certainly glad I wasn't involved. The important thing is that it's over, now, though the tower's a mess.~ 
@33 = ~What you means by mess?~
@34 = ~Well... it's a large place, my <LADYLORD>. They say it's been here long before the city was, that it was magically made a long time ago. The brotherhood made it their home about, oh, twenty years back or so. The former Archmage Arcane made Luskan what it is now. I don't know much about the place. We guards don't go inside it, usually, and don't mix with the wizardly folk... which is fine by me.~ 
@35 = ~Do you know about any cult in the tower?~
@36 = ~Have you heard of someone named Maugrim?~
@37 = ~Just how large is the tower?~
@38 = ~Most likely he died in the fighting, but I don't really know.~
@39 = ~Well... I don't mean to imply that security will be insufficient for you, my <LADYLORD>. So many of the wizards died in all the fighting, though. It's my understanding, too, that in the fighting there was a lot of... accidents. Things that still have to cleared up, you see. That's another reason why it's dangerous for you to roam.~ 
@40 = ~A cult? No, I've heard nothing like that. These wizards have never been the religious sort, in my experience.~
@41 = ~Hmmm. Someone named Maugrim arrived here a long time ago. Asked to speak to the wizards. Been here ever since, but I've never seen or heard of him in that time. Might be dead, I suppose.~
@42 = ~I have no idea, my <LADYLORD>. Frankly, I'm not even sure the wizards do. They don't get about the tower like normal folk, with stairs and halls and such. There are these lights that teleport them about to the rooms inside. Tempus knows how they figure out who's allowed where, or where they want to go. If you see one of those teleporter lights inside, I wouldn't play with it. Like I said, you may end up somewhere within the tower... and that wouldn't be good.~ 
@43 = ~You are free to enter the tower, if you wish. Remember, do not venture beyond the ambassadorial quarters.~ [NWISLU53]
