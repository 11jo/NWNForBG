@0 = ~NP: Nice to meet you. Sit quietly with me, will you? Its so noisy down there.~ /*Greetings and well met. Come to sit a bit in the heat, have you? Good for the skin.*/
@1 = ~Can I ask questions about who you are?~
@2 = ~Could I ask you something about this tavern?~
@3 = ~I'm going now.~
@4 = ~Oh, by all means. I'd like that.~
@5 = ~Who are you?~
@6 = ~What do you do around here?~
@7 = ~I suppose. I spend most of my time here, now. Waiting out the plague, you see. Could be in worse places, I wager.~
@8 = ~Do you know what is planned for downstairs?~
@9 = ~Have you noticed anything odd around here?~
@10 = ~A shame. I hope the <DAYNIGHT> treats you well. Come back anytime.~
@11 = ~Ulfnog is my given name. It is unremarkable to your ears, no doubt, but I quite like it. It serves me well. I am a traveler. Unfortunately I happened to be in Neverwinter when the plague began. I haven't stepped outside this inn for weeks.~ /*I am a traveler. Unfortunately I happened to be in Neverwinter when the plague began. I haven't stepped outside this inn for weeks.*/
@12 = ~Enjoying the heat, as I said. And the dark. It is quite pleasant in here once the door is closed. It shuts out the world. I don't much like the bustle downstairs. Them Bloodsailors are far too serious these days. They used to be... well, I'm droning on.~ /*I don't much like the bustle downstairs. Them Bloodsailors are far too serious these days. They used to be... well, I'm droning on.*/
@13 = ~What was that about the Bloodsailors?~
@14 = ~Hmm? Some fool auction, I think. I even heard there was some part of a cure on the block. Doesn't make sense, though...~
@15 = ~Why?~
@16 = ~Odd or strange? Well, them Bloodsailors have an unwholesome attachment to their ale. Not good dwarven ale, mind you, but foul and perverse mixings. I'd stay away from that Jalek down there, myself. He likes the hard stuff, and I mean hard to take.~ /*Odd or strange? Well, them Bloodsailors have an unwholesome attachment to their ale. Not good dwarven ale, mind you, but foul and perverse mixings.*/
@17 = ~Back to the inn... anything strange?~
@18 = ~Well, it's just that they used to be more fun. They had a right nonsensical bent to them that kept you on your toes. I know the plague probably has something to do with that, but there's more. It's like their leaders are taking them in a new direction. Ah, I've just had too much time to dwell on it, stuck here hiding from the plague. What do I care how uptight they get?~ /*Ah, I've just had too much time to dwell on it, stuck here hiding from the plague. What do I care how uptight they get?*/
@19 = ~Well, why is the auction here? Something like that would command a huge price. Why bother with the thugs that gathered their coppers? I mean, if you expect a big bidder, the only reason to have the auction here is to have all the people see who that bidder is. I think someone was trying to show off, and now it looks like the show has been cancelled.~ /*I mean, if you expect a big bidder, the only reason to have the auction here is to have all the people see who that bidder is.*/
@20 = ~The auction won't go ahead?~
@21 = ~Changes... shakeups... the Bloodsailors are upside-down. Some are allowed in the basement now, and some aren't. Almost like they've split in two. I think there's been a shift in power. Vengaul hasn't been seen for a bit and... well, there's some questionable things happening in the basement.~ /*Changes... shakeups... the Bloodsailors are upside-down. Some are allowed in the basement now, and some aren't. Almost like they've split in two.*/
@22 = ~How do I get down there?~
@23 = ~Don't think so. Vengaul Bloodsail himself was supposedly behind it, and he's late. Very late... and there's some other odd things...~
@24 = ~Do they still have their poor chef guarding the door? I bet he doesn't appreciate his pantry being locked up any more than I do. I overheard the password to get by him. You'll still need a key or some stout picks, though. They don't even let him open the door himself.~ /*I overheard the password to get by him. You'll still need a key or some stout picks, though. They don't even let him open the door himself.*/
@25 = ~The password is "Cornerstone." At least it ain't some maryweather pompous nickname or somebody's dog. I hate it when thugs get cute like that.~
@26 = ~Thanks. Er, how did you know all of this?~
@27 = ~You can learn a lot in a small dark room. Don't let anyone tell you different.~
@28 = ~NP: Hello again. Was it the unimaginable uproar downstairs that made you come back?~ /*Hello, again. Have you managed to kill the imp and close the portal?*/
@29 = ~NP: Not much is going on in the tavern now, after all the intrigue among the Bloody Sailors is over. Good and quiet.~ /*Not a lot happening in the tavern now, what with the shakeup in the Bloodsailors over. Nice and quiet in the dark.*/
