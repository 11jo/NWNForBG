@0 = ~Why have you come here? My parents told you to leave, didn't they? Did they also tell you how horrible this is? Can't you just leave me alone?~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I'm here to kill you. That's the only way.~
@3 = ~My name is Urth, and I've been infected with lycanthropy. That's why I'm hiding here, so no one has to see - this.~
@4 = ~I have some silver charms. Will you use one?
@5 = ~How did you ever become a werewolf?~
@6 = ~I've been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.~
@7 = ~I'll go find help for you. Just stay here.~
@8 = ~Death can be no worse than the fate I am living. Kill me, if you must, but do not be surprised when I fight back!~
@9 = ~Why not just kill me outright? Why ask me to do it myself?~
@10 = ~These are cures. They'll restore you.~
@11 = ~I'm here to kill you or cure you. You pick which I do.~
@12 = ~Prepare yourself for death then.~
@13 = ~Sir Karathis rounded up myself, Geth, Bran and Ander to help him hunt a werewolf. I was very excited for the adventure, and eager to join. Sir Karathis lost in battle to the werewolf, and, as a werewolf he hunted us down. He couldn't help it. I don't blame him.~ /*Sir Karathis rounded up myself, Geth, Bran and Ander to help him hunt a werewolf. I was very excited for the adventure, and eager to join.*/
@14 = ~What happened to Bran?~
@15 = ~Did Ander survive? Where is he now?~
@16 = ~Is Geth all right? Do you know where I could find him?~
@17 = ~Where is Sir Karathis now?~
@18 = ~Let us speak of something else.~
@19 = ~You'll tell everyone that I'm dead? Maybe then people would leave me alone, stop looking for me or making fun of me. My parents could have a normal life.~
@20 = ~Just give me your ring.~
@21 = ~Where else would I go? I'm surprised my parents even let me come back...~
@22 = ~Cures? To be honest, I'd rather die with hope than without. Give me your charm.~
@23 = ~Though I always thought that I'd rather die fighting, I'm tired of fighting. Fine, give me your charm, and I shall die with hope.~
@24 = ~Bran? I don't know... I know he was poisoned like me, and became a werewolf. But other than that?~
@25 = ~Ander may have escaped, he may not have. I never saw him again.~
@26 = ~Geth? I didn't see where he went, but if I were to guess, we used to play just outside Luskan, by the Green Griffon Inn.~
@27 = ~I don't even care about Karathis. I don't blame him, either. But I have no interest in that matter. I just feel - numb, about it.~
@28 = ~What else did you want to talk about?~
@29 = ~Fine, here it is. You should probably give it to Neurik. Tell him that I'm dead. Maybe this can all go away.~
@30 = ~It - It worked, I can feel it. Thank you so much. Here, take my ring and bring it to Neurik so he knows I'm all right! Now that this ordeal is over, I think I need a vacation. A long one. Farewell and thank you!~ /*It - It worked, I can feel it. Thank you so much. Here, take my ring and bring it to Neurik so he knows I'm all right!*/
@31 = ~It - It worked, I can feel it. Thank you so much. Now that this ordeal is over, I think I need a vacation. A long one. Farewell and thank you!~
@32 = ~Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can't control... Myself!~
@33 = ~Don't hurt me anymore! The wolf spirit is gone!~
