@0 = ~I am Zokan Thunderer, leader of my tribe, the people born of the Elk. Who are you that comes before me?~ [NWZOKA57]
@1 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@2 = ~<CHARNAME> is in charge of our group.~
@3 = ~My name is none of your business!~
@4 = ~Time for you to die, old man!~
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~Why have you come, <CHARNAME>? My people wither and die, young and old alike. The Wailing Death ravages my tribe and even our strongest warriors cannot stand against it. This is a place of death, <CHARNAME>. Soon we shall all be infected, we have come here to die. I ask you again, why have you come to this doomed fort?~
@7 = ~I have come to help you find a cure for the plague.~
@8 = ~Yusam, Druid of the Grove, has sent me to find why you have allied with Luskan.~
@9 = ~Why has the Elk tribe allied with Luskan?~
@10 = ~In names there is power. I have shared the power of my name with you, you must do the same. Only an enemy hides the power of his name.~
@11 = ~Then I guess we're enemies!~
@12 = ~May the strength of the Elk guide my blows!~
@13 = ~Then our parlay is over, though the Elk shall respect the banner of peace under which you have approached us.~
@14 = ~The Wailing Death is among my people. Men of Luskan came to me. They promised to heal my people. That is why we allied with them. But they spoke false. They have no cure. My people are doomed. But now we fight with Luskan for another reason. Revenge! Revenge against the Lord's Alliance and the man they sent to command Fort Ilkard. A man called Damas.~
@15 = ~If I bring you a cure, will you break your alliance with Luskan?~
@16 = ~Damas? Why do you want revenge on him?~
@17 = ~What kind of reward will I get for saving your people?~
@18 = ~I see I can't change your mind. Guess I'll just have to kill you!~
@19 = ~May the thunder of the Elk god rain down upon his enemies!~
@20 = ~The fate of my tribe is my greatest care. Cure us of the Wailing Death and the Elk tribe will no longer serve the Luskan forces. We will even forget our hatred and desire for vengeance against Commander Damas.~
@21 = ~I shall return once I make Damas give me the cure.~
@22 = ~Damas is the one who has infected us with the Wailing Death. We thought him a friend, but he only wants the Elk tribe gone so he can steal our land. He offered us a gift of blankets but he had secretly infected them with the plague!~
@23 = ~We are children of the land, we value no gold or treasure. If you will not save us form the goodness of your heart, I have nothing I can offer to change your mind.~
@24 = ~Damas will deny everything. You must take these blankets as proof of his crime. They are harmless now, the plague cannot spread after a few days but these blankets are what killed my people. If you truly intend to help the Elk tribe, you will go to Fort Ilkard and get the plague cure from Damas. I wish you luck, <CHARNAME>, for the sake of my people.~

@26 = ~Damas knew how quickly the plague could spread. No doubt he has a cure in his possession in case his own people become infected. We attack Fort Ilkard to try and recover the cure Damas will not give us.~
@27 = ~I still see you have the plague blankets I gave you before. Please, take them to Damas at Fort Ilkard. Show him the proof of his crime.~ [NWZOKA56]
@28 = ~If you truly intend to help the Elk tribe, you will go to Fort Ilkard and get the plague cure from Damas. I wish you luck, <CHARNAME>, for the sake of my people.~
@29 = ~My people wither and die from the plague. If they are not cured, the name of Zokan Thunderer will be remembered as the Uthgardt chieftain who could not save his tribe from extinction.~ [NWZOKA55]
@30 = ~Don't worry, Zokan. I have a cure for the plague right here. Take it to heal your people.~
@31 = ~I have a cure for the plague, Zokan. You can have it for a price.~
@32 = ~I thank you for this, <CHARNAME>. With this cure my shamans will heal our tribe. You have saved the people of the Elk. We are children of the land, we have no gold or treasure to give you. But take this spear. It is a treasure of the Elk tribe, long handed down from father to son among us. You have earned it by saving us from the terrors of the Wailing Death.~
@33 = ~Thank you Zokan, you honor me.~
@34 = ~That's it? I save your entire tribe and I get a lousy spear?~
@35 = ~You have brought the salvation of my people to this place of suffering, and now you insult our Uthgardt honor by bargaining for it? You would do well to rethink your heartless actions.~
@36 = ~Okay, you can have the cure for nothing. Here, take it.~
@37 = ~Hey, no reward, no cure.~
@38 = ~Please, take this token to Yusam the Druid in Beorunna's Well as a promise that we will no longer join the Luskan forces against them. Go with the blessing of the Elk, <CHARNAME>.~

@40 = ~We have nothing else to give, we are a nomadic people who care little for the treasures of your culture. But you will always have the gratitude of the Elk tribe. Please, take this token to Yusam the Druid in Beorunna's Well as a promise that we will no longer join the Luskan forces against them. Go with the blessing of the Elk, <CHARNAME>.~
@41 = ~You are a vile <MANWOMAN>! I will not bargain for the lives of my people with one such as you! You have revealed yourself to be an enemy of the Elk!~
@42 = ~I, Zokan Thunderer, thank you for saving my people from the Wailing Death. You are a hero to us, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWZOKA52]
@43 = ~As we promised when we recieved the cure, the Elk tribe is no longer allied with Luskan. We will trouble the Lord's Alliance no more.~
