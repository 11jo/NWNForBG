@0 = ~NP: Greetings. Harben told me more troops would be coming. But let me tell you, we still need you here. Never before have I seen such a rampage of this abomination. Undead usually appear over time, but here they rise before the corpse has cooled.~ [DRAKE050] /*I've never seen an infestation like this. Undead fester over time, but here, they rise before a corpse even cools.*/
@1 = ~I've seen how dangerous the undead can be.~
@2 = ~Maybe somebody less squeamish should replace you.~
@3 = ~I will lend my assistance where required.~
@4 = ~NP: What we need now is order on the streets. First of all, people need help. We need you. Once the people are safe, we can find the source of these undead and cut off this conduit. I think Harben will agree with me and reward everyone for their help.~ /*Once people are safe we can find the source of these undead and get down their throats. I'm sure Harben agrees and will reward people accordingly for helping.*/
@5 = ~Tell me of any people that need immediate help.~
@6 = ~I'll poke around on my own without your guidance.~
@7 = ~Where do you think the threat originates from?~
@8 = ~NP: Ha! Sorry, but that's not possible. I fight the undead. If you can help me, that's great, but we won't gain anything from confrontation. What we need now is order on the streets. First of all, people need help. We need you. Once the people are safe, we can find the source of these undead and cut off this conduit. I think Harben will agree with me and reward everyone for their help.~ /*Once people are safe we can find the source of these undead and get down their throats. I'm sure Harben agrees and will reward people accordingly for helping.*/
@9 = ~NP: These guys, Krestal and Jemani, were seen barricaded in their own homes. It is possible that some more houses were captured. Crestal and Jemani may also know something about strange phenomena in the area, but we have not yet been able to question them.~ /*The lad Krestal and the lad Jemanie were spotted barricaded in their homes. More houses may be overrun.*/
@10 = ~Tell me of Krestal.~
@11 = ~Tell me of Jemanie.~
@12 = ~I will look into it.~
@13 = ~If you learn anything, keep us informed. We must know what we're dealing with, and if it's connected to the plague.~

@15 = ~Unknown. We don't have the men for simple information gathering. It's vital we find out what is going on, and if it's plague-related.~
@16 = ~NP: His house is located in the eastern part of the district center. He usually spends time with his gang, but they seem to have disappeared now.~ /*His home is in the central east of the district, north of the Helmite shrine. He is usually with a gang but they appear to have disappeared.*/
@17 = ~Jemanie's home is in the west central section of the district. He has a brother too, but I have no news of him.~
@18 = ~NP: Ah, I've heard rumors of your accomplishments in Neverwinter. It's nice to know that you're on our side today. Never before have I seen such a rampage of this abomination. Undead usually appear over time, but here they rise before the corpse has cooled.~ [DRAKE051] /*I've never seen an infestation like this. Undead fester over time, but here, they rise before a corpse even cools.*/
@19 = ~Ahh, you have returned to me. Do you need me to repeat my earlier information, or have you something else?~ [DRAKE052]
@20 = ~Go over what is required.~
@21 = ~Have you found any new information?~
@22 = ~We need people safe, first of all. We also need to find out what is causing this infestation. The undead don't simple get up. Something has to drag them back from the other side.~
@23 = ~Anyone need immediate help?~
@24 = ~NP: I know a thing or two about the Sword Coast Boys and the snake cult, but you probably already know that. Most likely, it was your actions that helped us obtain this information. Forgive me if I say something that you already know.~ /*It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.*/
@25 = ~Tell me about the Sword Coast Boys.~
@26 = ~Tell me about this Snake Cult.~
@27 = ~Goodbye.~
@28 = ~NP: I know a thing or two about the Sword Coast Boys, but you probably already know that. Most likely, it was your actions that helped us obtain this information. Forgive me if I say something that you already know.~ /*It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.*/
@29 = ~NP: I know a few things about the serpent cult, but you probably already know that. Most likely, it was your actions that helped us obtain this information. Forgive me if I say something that you already know.~ /*It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.*/
@30 = ~I haven't heard anything new. Sure could use someone out there to poke around and get some answers.~
@31 = ~NP: Help is needed for Krestal in the west of the region, and Jemani in the eastern border. Their houses are in the occupied territory, and we do not know if they are still alive. I hope we can learn something from the people we save. My couriers might be able to let us know if the guards find anything. You just have to ask if we've found anything new.~ /*Hopefully something can be learned from the people we save. I have runners in the area that may be able to inform us if guards like you find anything. Just ask if we've found anything new.*/
@32 = ~NP: Help is required for Krestal in the west of the district. His house is in the occupied territory, and we do not know if he is still alive. I hope we can learn something from the people we save. My couriers might be able to let us know if the guards find anything. You just have to ask if we've found anything new.~ /*Hopefully something can be learned from the people we save.

@33 = ~NP: Help is required by Jemani in the area of the eastern border of the district. His house is in the occupied territory, and we do not know if he is still alive.

You just have to ask if we've found anything new.~ /*Hopefully something can be learned from the people we save. I have runners in the area that may be able to inform us if guards like you find anything. Just ask if we've found anything new.*/
@34 = ~I think most people have been secured here or in the Helmite shrine. Now all that is left is to find what is behind all of this. I hope I can provide you information to help in the investigation.~
@35 = ~NP: Something spoils the youth. A being named Gulnan offered power in exchange for her participation. Whoever she is, she needs access to the warehouse. Try to find passages and break into her lair. Now you know the area, so lead the operation. She took advantage of the fact that the city is raging pestilence. She needs to be stopped.~ /*You know the area now, so you spearhead the effort. She has taken advantage of a plague-ravaged city, and must be stopped.*/
@36 = ~NP: An organization of vicious zealots, followers of a being called Gulnan. They settled in a manor in the northwestern part of Beggar's Nest. She needs access to the cult, so there must be some passage leading to her or her lair. Now you know the area, so lead the operation. She took advantage of the fact that the city is raging pestilence. She needs to be stopped.~ /*An organization of malevolent fanatics, following someone named Gulnan. They are entrenched in an estate in the northwest of the Beggar's Nest.*/
@37 = ~NP: Well, it should be noted that no matter what you do in this damned graveyard, the immediate threat is now eliminated. Of course, the plague still exists, but the zombies don't seem to threaten the area anymore.~ [DRAKE054] /*Well, I must say that whatever you did in that bloody graveyard, it seems our immediate troubles are over.*/
@38 = ~You should report to Aribeth with whatever you found. Oh, Harben may give you something special as well as reward.~
@39 = ~NP: We knew we could count on you to repeat your exploits in the area. We've heard rumors about your past accomplishments. Of course, the plague still exists, but the zombies don't seem to threaten the area anymore.~ [DRAKE055] /*I knew we could count on you to repeat your success in this district. I had heard good things about you.*/
