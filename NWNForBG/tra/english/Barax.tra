@0 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>, Hero of Neverwinter! I am Barax, formerly a soldier of Neverwinter, now I intend to hunt down the bastards who did this to us!~
@1 = ~How do you know my name?~
@2 = ~Hunt down who?~
@3 = ~I can't talk right now.~
@4 = ~Everyone in Neverwinter knows your name. You were one of the people who saved us from the plague and I suspect that you'll help just as much in the search for the bastards who started it.~
@5 = ~Who are we searching for?~
@6 = ~The cult of course! This mysterious organization that unleashed the plague on Neverwinter and killed so many innocent people. A hero like you is just what we need to find them.~
@7 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@8 = ~I have no interest in finding this cult.~
@9 = ~Don't let me keep you busy. I'm sure that you'll want to talk to Aribeth. We have to report all of our findings to her, after all. Best of luck with the search!~
@10 = ~I'm sure that it will be more than enough. A lot of innocent people were killed and this cult owes us a debt that can only be repaid in blood. Give 'em hell for all of us, <CHARNAME>!~
@11 = ~What!? These bastards unleashed a plague upon our city that killed countless innocent people! We have a chance to find them and you say you don't care?!~
@12 = ~None of your business, soldier. Goodbye.~
@13 = ~You're right. We should track them down. I'll do my best.~
@14 = ~I have nothing else to say to you. I thought that you were a hero.~
@15 = ~Excuse me, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I don't wish to speak with someone who is so uncaring about the innocents who suffered through the plague.~
@16 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. I hope you find the cult soon. They must be punished!~
@17 = ~I heard that you tracked down the cult in Luskan. Give 'em hell for all of us, <CHARNAME>!~
@18 = ~MT: Greetings. Hope you find this cult soon. They must be punished!~ /*Greetings, <CHARNAME>. I hope you find the cult soon. They must be punished!*/
@19 = ~MT: I heard you tracked down the cult in Luskan. Give them hell for all of us!~ /*I heard that you tracked down the cult in Luskan. Give 'em hell for all of us, <CHARNAME>!*/
