@1 = ~Ophala and her girls are angels, I tell you. Beautiful angels who look after all the sick and dying in this place.~
@2 = ~How come a hero like you is here at the Moonstone Mask instead of fighting the Luskan army in the southern section of the city?~
@3 = ~Look at all the wounded in this place. Most of them fell trying to defend the southern districts of the city, or so I heard.~
