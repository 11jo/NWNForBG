@0 = ~Hmm? What yous want? Yous ain't no friend of Mr. Androd, so yous shouldn't be bothering me.~
@1 = ~I just want to ask some simple questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Ahh, I don't answer questions good. If'n I could, I wouldn't be standing in front of some stupid noble-type home.~
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~Do you know anything about the Wailing Death?~
@6 = ~Do you know the Docks district very well?~
@7 = ~Why can't I enter the estate?~
@8 = ~Fare yous well... just don't cause me trouble.~
@9 = ~NP: My name is Burt. I'm just a guard here. I don't like it, but who's having an easy time, huh? I hate that guy. I hate him! That Mr. Androd, he's so snooty and too rich. Talks to me like I don't know my business. Well, I do. I just don't want to do it. Besides, he doesn't even need me. He's got guys on the inside who'd kill you without a second thought. And I'm just taking up space. Yes!~ /*This Mr. Androd, he's fussy and too bloody rich for his own good. Talks to me like I don't know the job. I know it... I just don't want to do it.*/
@10 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@11 = ~NP: I wish I didn't know what I know. I've seen people die from it. They go out in the street, screaming. like crazy. like they're gonna end up attacking their own mothers. I hope I don't pick up on that, but it's not up to me. And it doesn't seem to be up to anyone.~ /*What I know I wish I didn't. I seen people die of it. They go out screaming... crazy... like they would attack their own mothers at the end.*/
@12 = ~NP: I thought so, but now it's a mess. There are thieves everywhere! I've seen people being robbed everywhere. I'll be quiet. I don't know why everyone's gone crazy, and I certainly don't want to get involved. I'd rather stay out of it.~ /*I just lay low. I don't want to know why people are so crazy, and I for sure don't want to get involved. I just stay out of the way.*/
@13 = ~I'm looking for work.~
@14 = ~NP: Ha, if you can break down a door, what do I care? I don't even want the job, and I don't even want a fight. I don't really care. It's not my house, so why stop people from coming in? If they're stupid enough to go through with it. it's none of my business. But it's dangerous inside, I'm warning you.~ /*I don't really care much. This ain't my house, so why should I try to stop people from going in? If they are stupid enough to risk it... not my business.*/
@15 = ~Why it not be safe?~
@16 = ~You really won't do anything if I go in?~
@17 = ~Good luck, that's all I got to say. Nobody hiring. I took this job and I don't even want it. It's all there was, though.~
@18 = ~NP: Why do you think that is? Would Mr. Androd leave a lowlife like me outside if he didn't have *real* bloodthirsty guards inside? They're very fierce! I think he's hired mercenaries. Thank you, I'd rather stay outside. If you want to come in, that's up to you.~ /*Why do yous think? Why would Mr. Androd leave a nobody like me out here if'n he didn't have bloodthirsty *real* guards inside? They are rough!*/
@19 = ~Look, it ain't my house, so why should I care? I mean, I guess I get paid to protect it, but not enough to risk my neck.~
