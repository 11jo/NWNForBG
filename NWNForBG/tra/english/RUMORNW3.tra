@0 = ~MT: Rumor has it that Kurt's soldiers are making their way here through a breach in the wall to the west of the district.~ /*I could use a good soldier. Welcome aboard, Vanya.*/
@1 = ~MT: It is said that Baram infects all his soldiers with lycanthropy and after that they can turn into rats. He probably thinks rats fight better than humans.~ /*They say Baram's down in the sewers... but I know for a fact that the place is full of monsters, so that can't be true.*/
@2 = ~MT: They say that the mages in Hozyan's Tower recently also all fought among themselves. But now they have chosen a new Arcane Archmage. His name is Maugrim.~ /*They say it is better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. I never used to believe that... until now.*/
@3 = ~MT: Baram is said to have made an alliance with the necromancers, who summon hordes of ghouls to him.~ /*Do you know what happened to the kobolds that attacked you?*/
@4 = ~MT: They say that Kurt made an alliance with the priests of Auril, they help him with their magic.~ /*I found Evaine in Kurth's fortress, but she isn't with me at the moment.*/
