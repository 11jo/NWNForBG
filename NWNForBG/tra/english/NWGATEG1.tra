@0 = ~Hold! Passage from the city of Neverwinter is forbidden. We cannot risk the plague being spread to the surrounding countryside.~ [NWGATE50]
@1 = ~I just have a few questions.~
@2 = ~I serve Aribeth and Lord Nasher. Let me pass.~
@3 = ~Anyone get let out in last little while?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I am trusted with the grave duty of keeping the whole of the North free of plague and you want to chat me up? Please, just leave me to my duty. I can't lose focus. I can't let anyone gain my favor. Everyone is to be treated the same. Nobody gets out.~ /*Please, just leave me to my duty. I can't lose focus. I can't let anyone gain my favor. Everyone is to be treated the same. Nobody gets out.*/
@6 = ~Well, has anyone been allowed in, then?~
@7 = ~I don't care if you're the bloody avatar of Ilmater himself, you're not getting through this gate. Nobody passes this point until a cure is found.~
@8 = ~What, did you not understand what I just said? Passage outside if forbidden. That means no one, and I mean NO ONE gets out.~
@9 = ~Well met, citizen.~
@10 = ~NP: Ð­... I'm not forbidden to let people into the city. They're warned of the plague, they can enter at their own risk. I think only Dester and his Helmites would dare to do that, the plague had just begun. They have been tirelessly helping everyone ever since. It's a huge sacrifice on their part to risk themselves like that.~ /*That being said, nobody has entered the city recently. In fact, I believe only Desther and his Helmite brethren have dared risk it, and that was shortly after the plague began.*/
