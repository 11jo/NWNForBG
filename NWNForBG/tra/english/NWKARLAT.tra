@0 = ~Judge? Judge, is that you? I don't remember -- it's so hard to string my thoughts together one to the next...~ [NWKAR050]
@1 = ~Are you Karlat Jhareg?~
@2 = ~Why do you sound so confused?~
@3 = ~Be at peace. I am the Judge you seek.~
@4 = ~Why is this tower so full of fire?~
@5 = ~Back to the grave, you undead beast!~
@6 = ~Yes. Yes, that's my name... It's been so long since I've heard someone speak it! The last one to do so was my... my brother...~
@7 = ~I just don't know whether or not we've spoken before. I live in a constant daze. Everything's come undone since my brother... since that night...~
@8 = ~Yes. Yes, I seek an end to this torment of unknowing! I do not even know if we have spoken before... Everything's come undone since my brother...~
@9 = ~Fire? I - I was doing research once, trying to find something... And I found it - I did but... then my brother took it from me...~
@10 = ~No, I have forgotten many things but not my power. The last time I used it was that night... the night my... my brother...~
@11 = ~Quint! Yes, it was him! He was responsible! He invited all the children of the village to his tower and he began to read to them...~
@12 = ~Tell me more...~
@13 = ~Get to the point.~
@14 = ~It was horrible... The blood, it was everywhere. Every one of them died, every child... He's gone mad, you know. My younger brother has gone mad... I arrived there too late. I rebuked him and he groveled there before me. He said he did it for me, all for me, all for the love of an older brother!~ 
@15 = ~I unleashed the fire against him but he fled and stole my most powerful artifact, my phylactery, and made use of it. Now we are all stuck here because of him, pressed like flowers between the pages of the Book of Time.~ 
@16 = ~I've got a few more questions.~
@17 = ~Will you give that as a written oath?~
@18 = ~I've spoken to Karlat. He tells a different story.~
@19 = ~This your journal?~
@20 = ~It was horrible... Quint killed the children and when I rebuked him, he wrested my phylactery from me, cursing us all to be trapped here forever.~
@21 = ~I have the time, Judge, if not always the memory. Ask what you will.~
@22 = ~A lich's phylactery, huh? Aren't liches evil?~
@23 = ~Why would Quint do such a thing?~
@24 = ~Who has the phylactery now?~
@25 = ~What about Lathander and the Guardian?~
@26 = ~All right, enough questions.~
@27 = ~I have suffered here too long, tormented by forgetfulness amidst this endless pall of smoke. I would only be too glad... Here, take it: my written oath of every word that I have uttered here. Present it to the Guardian and let us have our Judgment.~ 
@28 = ~Of course he does! Did you expect him to confess? No doubt in his madness and shame, even he no longer knows the truth of things. I have given you my story. Let him give you his. You are the Judge, not us.~ 
@29 = ~Why yes. Yes, the hand is mine. What does it say? I have half forgotten...~
@30 = ~You tricked your brother into the crime.~
@31 = ~You sought undeath out of a greed for knowledge.~
@32 = ~You acted on the advice of someone named Belial.~
@33 = ~Nothing. It doesn't say anything of note.~
@34 = ~I once had half-elven blood in my veins. Among the elves, some called Baelnorns seek lichdom that they might stand watch over their families. I would have preserved our family had not my brother first destroyed it. When he interfered, I became but a half-lich, somehow.~ 
@35 = ~If only I can recover the phylactery he stole, I can finish the ceremony and become what I was meant to be... It would free us all from this wretched place.~
@36 = ~He was young and foolish, with no understanding of the arcane arts, no understanding of the world in which we wizards operate... We consort with demons and keep imps as our familiars but does that make us evil?~ 
@37 = ~Perhaps he performed the unspeakable act in an effort to earn my respect, my affection. Perhaps he wanted to prove himself before his brother.~
@38 = ~Lathander gave it to the Guardian for safekeeping and she has kept it ever since. If only I can recover it, I can finish the ceremony and become what I was meant to be... It would free us all from this accursed place.~ 
@39 = ~What good is a god of the dawn if he traps us in this eternal night? My brother prayed to him before the madness came on... The Guardian may claim Lathander did not stand in Judgment, yet Quint wanders the village freely while I rot in here forever, in this wretched half-form!~
@40 = ~Yes, my Judge...~
@41 = ~I... I needed the blood. It was necessary. Without it, how could I protect the village? It was a high price but it would have meant a bright future...~
@42 = ~That's all it said. Will you give that as a written oath?~
@43 = ~Is a greed for Knowledge any different than a greed for Love, a greed for Justice? Before you Judge me, Judge yourself...~
@44 = ~Belial? I - I know that name... Yes, he was a demon I consorted with. He was the one who gave me the phylactery and taught me to use it... Why, the summoning room is just down the hall... Maybe he would know the truth of things!~
@45 = ~Of course. Is that everything, then? Do you want my oath?~
@46 = ~We await your decision, Judge.~ [NWKAR054]
@47 = ~Greetings, Lady Guardian. Greetings, Judge.~
@48 = ~Our souls long for rest, Lady Guardian, and our hearts for justice.~
@49 = ~At last! What was stolen from me has been returned and I may finally shed this half-dead form!~
@50 = ~I made it quick, just a moment of pain. I was told that they would be returned to life as soon as I finished my ceremony but... I never finished...~
@51 = ~No!!! The phylactery is everything!~
