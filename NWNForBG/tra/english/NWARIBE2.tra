@0 = ~It is good to see you here in Port Llast, my friend. If we are to have any luck in tracking down this strange cult behind the plague, it will be with your aid I am sure. I do not know how much you have been told about Lord Nasher's orders. I shall help you understand whatever I can, certainly.~ [NWARI292]
@1 = ~What exactly are Lord Nasher's orders?~
@2 = ~I am more concerned about how you are holding up.~
@3 = ~What do you think I should do now?~
@4 = ~You know, of course, that Desther and... and Fenthick... were associated with some manner of religious cult that was behind the Wailing Death in the city. We know so little about this cult... and it would be foolish in the extreme to suppose that simply because their activities in Neverwinter have been stopped, that they have been defeated.~ [NWARI294] 
@5 = ~How I feel is... unimportant, <CHARNAME>, next to the mission we have been given. Please, allow me to explain what is required of us.~ [NWARI472]
@6 = ~Lord Nasher commands that we track down the headquarters of this cult, and discover their plans... and stop them, before another atrocity is committed. Aarin Gend, Lord Nasher's spymaster, is here in Port Llast to help us do this... and has brought reports of many strange activities throughout the northern lands.~ [NWARI296] 
@7 = ~It is possible that agents of the cult may be behind some of these activities. If so, we may be able to find them and discover where their base is located. Your aid in this, <CHARNAME>, will prove invaluable.~ [NWARI298]
@8 = ~I have some questions about this mission.~
@9 = ~I have located some information about the cult.~
@10 = ~You look tired. Have you not been sleeping well?~
@11 = ~You said I should ask you how you became a paladin.~
@12 = ~You seem angry. Is something wrong?~
@13 = ~Do you have any advice for me?~
@14 = ~Fine, I'll go.~
@15 = ~Of course. Ask what you will of me, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI299]
@16 = ~What are you and Aarin Gend going to be doing here while I search?~
@17 = ~How do you propose I look for this cult?~
@18 = ~What should I do if I discover something?~
@19 = ~Why are we not searching more in Neverwinter?~
@20 = ~Just what do we know about this cult?~
@21 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@22 = ~All right, I'll be going.~ 
@23 = ~What do you wish to know?~ [NWARI312] 
@24 = ~This is good news. What have you discovered?~ [NWARI313]
@25 = ~Show her Ganon's journal.~
@26 = ~Show her the letter to Solomon.~
@27 = ~Show her the letter to Neva.~
@28 = ~Show her Relmar's journal.~
@29 = ~Show her the Charwood cultist's journal.~
@30 = ~Show her the letter to Vardoc.~
@31 = ~Nothing yet.~
@32 = ~So the cult was responsible for stirring up the humanoids in the hills? You are to be commended for putting an end to that danger, indeed. While this information you bring is incredibly valuable, it still does not tell us where the cult is based. We need that information if we are to strike at them.~ [NWARI314]
@33 = ~Fortunately, it does mention where more cultists may be found. Charwood and the Neverwinter Wood. Search those places, perhaps, for the information we seek. Have you found any other information?~ [NWARI631] 
@34 = ~The cult sought to strike against you through an agent, did they? Fortunate for us that their efforts proved fruitless. Have you found any other information?~ [NWARI633] 
@35 = ~This Maugrim grows desperate, I see. They fear you... and well they should. Have you found any other information?~ [NWARI634] 
@36 = ~One can only wonder what this cult might have done had their plans in the Neverwinter Wood been successful. Well done. This information suggests that this Maugrim and his cult are to be found within Luskan. I do wonder, however, if this is not some attempt on their part to deceive us. Perhaps they meant for you to find this? No, I don't have any proof.~ [NWARI635] 
@37 = ~Thank you. I'll return shortly.~ 
@38 = ~Hmm. The ramblings of a madman. One has to wonder what this cult hoped to achieve in that haunted place. Have you found any other information?~ [NWARI639] 
@39 = ~So the cult sought to strike at you again! And this time they have given themselves away in the process. Well done! This information suggests that this Maugrim and his cult are to be found within Luskan. I do wonder, however, if this is not some attempt on their part to deceive us. Perhaps they meant for you to find this? Prompt On Replace~ [NWARI640] 
@40 = ~Thank you. I'll return shortly.~ 
@41 = ~This information confirms it, then... the cult is located within Luskan. Excellent work, <CHARNAME>. You have justified Lord Nasher's faith in you and more. You will need to get into Luskan and enter the Host Tower, itself. Speak to Aarin... hopefully he will have some ideas on how you can go about this.~ [NWARI636] 
@42 = ~That sounds like a dangerous task.~
@43 = ~Can I expect some help? Will you be coming with me?~
@44 = ~How will I get into the tower?~
@45 = ~Okay, I'll go to Aarin.~ 
@46 = ~Without a doubt. You have faced tasks of similar danger, however, and excelled... and will no doubt face much worse before this threat is ended. You did agree to aid Lord Nasher, did you not? Whatever your reasons, I find it hard to believe that you expected this to be very simple.~ [NWARI317] 
@47 = ~Both Aarin and I will join you in Luskan, of course. Aarin will be there to help you enter the tower, <CHARNAME>. As for me, I have... other plans.~ [NWARI319]
@48 = ~Speak to Aarin Gend, as I said. With luck, he will have a plan to not only get you into the city but into the tower, itself.~ [NWARI323]
@49 = ~I am here to see that Lord Nasher's commands are carried out, while Aarin continues to use his network of spies to gain more information beyond Neverwinter's walls. Admittedly, my own role seems sparse. Part of me thinks that my Lord Nasher simply wishes someone he trusts in this role... while another believes he does not wish to be reminded of Fenthick or my pain. Regardless, we will do all that we can to help you, <CHARNAME>. Do not think your efforts go unrecognized.~ [NWARI300]
@50 = ~Aarin has several ideas on places where the cult may be hidden. Currently he is working on finding a way into the city of Luskan... its gates have been sealed since the plague in Neverwinter began. I suggest you talk to Aarin about where these places might be. Search for any clues about the rise of ancient cults or odd activities. Once a way into Luskan is found, you can search there, as well. If we are fortunate, you will perhaps encounter some part of the cult and gain information as to who they are and where they are based.~ [NWARI303] 
@51 = ~Any information you discover should be brought to Aarin and myself. Once we know more about the cult, Lord Nasher can decide what to do next.~ [NWARI306]
@52 = ~The search does continue within the city, <CHARNAME>. Indeed, Lord Nasher is having Neverwinter scoured thoroughly for more traces of the cult. It is his feeling, however, that the true force of the cult lies outside of Neverwinter... and that it is your efforts here that will prove the most valuable.~ [NWARI307] 
@53 = ~Desther appears to have been their link in Neverwinter, as you discovered, but of the cult itself we have been able to ascertain little. Aarin is positive that its true heart lies outside of Neverwinter, and that it has yet to show us the extent of its strength. The task ahead of us will, no doubt, be most dangerous... but that makes it all the more necessary that we do not remain ignorant of what this cult is and what it intends.~ [NWARI309] 
@54 = ~Why do you ask me that, <CHARNAME>? The spymaster put you up to this, didn't he?~ [NWARI362]
@55 = ~No, he didn't.~
@56 = ~Yes, he did, actually.~ 
@57 = ~No, he didn't.~ 
@58 = ~Yes, he did, actually.~
@59 = ~I see. I suppose my state is obvious enough. Aarin is far more concerned than is warranted, however... certainly a few bad dreams are not a reason to become alarmed. The servants claim I speak in my sleep and say frightening things. They creep about me cautiously like I have gone mad, and Aarin pays their superstitious twitterings far more heed than he should. After all that has happened with the plague and... and Fenthick, I think a disturbing dream or two is not so surprising, wouldn't you agree, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI363]
@60 = ~No, it's not surprising at all.~
@61 = ~These dreams are disturbing enough to keep you from sleep?~
@62 = ~Perhaps you've gone mad. Completely cracked.~
@63 = ~Finally, someone with some sense! I keep telling Aarin that these strange dreams are nothing to be concerned over, but he insists on treating me like an invalid. These dreams shall... they shall pass, in time. There are far more important matters to worry over than how I am sleeping.~ [NWARI366]
@64 = ~You don't sound very convinced.~
@65 = ~Now you, too? Has the world gone mad, or is it me? These dreams are... disturbing and frightening, but... they shall pass! They are my burden to bear and no one else's.~ [NWARI371]
@66 = ~Why don't you tell me about these dreams? Maybe it will help.~
@67 = ~Have you considered that maybe it's more serious than that?~
@68 = ~The dreams are simply dreams, no doubt caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear. I will not discuss them... especially not with you. Let us return to the topic of your mission, <CHARNAME>, and speak of this no more.~ [NWARI369]
@69 = ~*Sigh* Perhaps you are right, <CHARNAME>. Having the perspective of another on these dreams may not be a bad idea.~ [NWARI372]
@70 = ~I... I am falling, in the dream. Always falling. Surrounded by a heavy blackness which chokes and drowns me. Grasping hands reach out to me, and the voices... a cacophony of whispers that plead to me for help. And... and then I see a shrouded figure. It is Fenthick. He is walking away from me and I run to catch him, but always he eludes me in the darkness. The voices get so much louder. They are accusing me, blaming me, and I... I feel ashamed, though I do not know what I am being blamed for. I cry out for help, for them to stop their assault, but I go unheeded.~ [NWARI373]
@71 = ~And then I catch up to the figure... and I see that it is not Fenthick. He turns and gazes at me with sad eyes... and I know it is Tyr... and then my god turns his back on me. These... these are my dreams, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps now you can understand why I have not wished to discuss them. I am... frightened... of what they may mean.~ [NWARI376]
@72 = ~That's understandable. They would frighten me, as well.~
@73 = ~It is only fears and worries dredged up by your mind, Aribeth.~
@74 = ~I don't know what to say about that.~
@75 = ~It's all right, <CHARNAME>. There isn't much that can be said, is there? But... I am glad I told you. It makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, somehow. I do feel better for it, thank you. Hah... I am reminded, a little, of how I was introduced to the paladin life. You should ask me to tell you the tale, sometime. Until then, however, let's return to the subject of your task. That is something we can focus on, at least.~ [NWARI386]
@76 = ~Gone mad, have I? Some restless nights caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear and suddenly I am some raving harpy to be handled with padded gloves? I should have known better than to discuss such a matter with you. Let us return to the topic of your mission and speak of this no more.~ [NWARI389] 
@77 = ~I did say that, didn't I? Are you sure you wish to hear the tale? It is not an exciting one, and I would not wish to bore you, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI392]
@78 = ~No, I want to hear it.~
@79 = ~Maybe some other time, then.~
@80 = ~As you wish. Do not complain later, however, if you find the tale does not live up to your expectations. I am, after all, no bard. Do nothing.~ [NWARI393] 
@81 = ~That would probably be best. What can I do for you, then?~ [NWARI431]
@82 = ~Where should I begin? My family lived in a human village in the wildlands of the northern mountains, and I once longed for nothing more than to be a skilled hunter, as my father was. The village was destroyed when the orcs massed and attacked the southlands. My family was killed, though I survived. For years, I thought of little but wreaking bloody vengeance upon the orcs. I stalked the crags with my bow, mercilessly killing all I crossed.~ [NWARI394] 
@83 = ~That doesn't sound like you at all.~
@84 = ~How did you become a paladin after that?~
@85 = ~Okay, getting bored now...~
@86 = ~Indeed, I was much different then. My vengeance consumed me, and I dealt death at every turn... but I had no peace.~ [NWARI397]
@87 = ~It was not an easy thing. My lust for vengeance consumed me. I was no better than the beasts I hunted, to be truthful.~ [NWARI428]
@88 = ~Shush, <CHARNAME>. I have barely begun my tale. Control your attention span for a moment.~ [NWARI429]
@89 = ~On the fifth winter of my hunt, I stalked an orc tribe deep into the Spine of the World and encountered a blizzard so terrible I could do naught but camp and pray. The blizzard was merciless and lasted days, and as I lay dying in the snow and wind I spotted a human man approaching. I thought I was mad. He was tall and strong, though I noticed he was missing his right hand. The cold did not seem to affect him... and he looked down at me kindly and picked me up from the snow without effort.~ [NWARI398]
@90 = ~I remember nothing beyond that. When I awoke, I found myself at a small Ilmateri monastery near the city of Silverymoon. The monks told me I had nearly died.~ [NWARI401]
@91 = ~Who was the man who saved you?~
@92 = ~The man who saved you... that was Tyr?~
@93 = ~You're right, this is a long story.~
@94 = ~I have often thought that he was none other than an avatar of Tyr, himself, the Lord of Justice. Though perhaps that is presumptuous of me. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater had not seen him bring me... and I never saw him again. Or perhaps I should say I never saw him in person. He came to me time and time again in my dreams for many months afterwards, telling me that my vengeance would bring no true justice. I refused him at first, determined to return to my bloody hunt. The dreams came more frequently, and the man grew more stern with me. The path lay elsewhere, I was told, and reluctantly I left the mountains and came to Neverwinter and entered the service of Tyr. The dreams never came again.~ [NWARI402] 
@95 = ~What happened then?~
@96 = ~You became a cleric, then, like Fenthick?~
@97 = ~So you think Tyr, himself, commanded you to worship him?~
@98 = ~I have often thought him thus. An avatar of the Maimed God, himself. Though perhaps that is presumptuous of me. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater had not seen him bring me... and I never saw him again. Or perhaps I should say I never saw him in person. He came to me time and time again in my dreams for many months afterwards, telling me that my vengeance would bring no true justice. I refused him at first, determined to return to my bloody hunt. The dreams came more frequently, and the man grew more stern with me. The path lay elsewhere, I was told, and reluctantly I left the mountains and came to Neverwinter and entered the service of Tyr. The dreams never came again.~ [NWARI402] 
@99 = ~(sigh) You did ask to hear this, <CHARNAME>. Do you want me to stop?~ [NWARI426]
@100 = ~No, I'm only joking.~ 
@101 = ~Yes, maybe I'll hear this later.~
@102 = ~Very funny. Perhaps I am just not in the mood for levity. Let me return to the topic of the man who saved me. I have often thought that he was none other than an avatar of Tyr, himself, the Lord of Justice. Though perhaps that is presumptuous of me. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater had not seen him bring me... and I never saw him again. Or perhaps I should say I never saw him in person. He came to me time and time again in my dreams for many months afterwards, telling me that my vengeance would bring no true justice. I refused him at first, determined to return to my bloody hunt. The dreams came more frequently, and the man grew more stern with me. The path lay elsewhere, I was told, and reluctantly I left the mountains and came to Neverwinter and entered the service of Tyr. The dreams never came again.~ [NWARI427] 
@103 = ~Tyr's clerics took me in and over time I learned their ways and grew to admire the Maimed God. I chose to champion justice instead as his paladin, and found peace at long last. My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last...~ [NWARI407] 
@104 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sadden you.~
@105 = ~You're not going to cry again, are you?~
@106 = ~Okay, story over. Let's talk about something else..~ 
@107 = ~No, I... thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you for listening to my tale. You have been a great comfort to me. I would be glad to call you a... a friend, <CHARNAME>. Tyr only knows that finding a friend in times like these is difficult enough. I hope you feel the same.~ [NWARI409] 
@108 = ~Yes.~
@109 = ~I don't need another friend.~
@110 = ~Whoa... slow down there, lady! Does this mean we can go to bed soon?~ 
@111 = ~I am glad, my friend. Let us return to the subject of your mission, then.~ [NWARI412]
@112 = ~I... I see. That is too bad, then, for a true friend is a grand thing to have. Let us return to the topic of your mission, then.~ [NWARI413]
@113 = ~... I shall forget you said that, sir. Perhaps we should forget that I said anything, either. Let's get back to discussing your task.~ [NWARI415] 
@114 = ~Not right away. I did not meet Fenthick until later, in fact. Tyr's clerics took me in and over time I learned their ways and grew to admire the Maimed God. I chose to champion justice instead as his paladin, and found peace at long last. My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last...~ [NWARI423] 
@115 = ~I do not know. I did not worship him at all, at first. I was resentful of the dreams and bitter over giving up my hunt of the orcs. Tyr's clerics took me in and over time I learned their ways and grew to admire the Maimed God. I chose to champion justice instead as his paladin, and found peace at long last. My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last...~ [NWARI424] 
@116 = ~No. No... I am done with crying. Thank you for listening to my tale. You have been a great comfort to me. I would be glad to call you a... a friend, <CHARNAME>. Tyr only knows that finding a friend in times like these is difficult enough. I hope you feel the same.~ [NWARI409]
@117 = ~Let us talk of something else.~ [NWARI422]
@118 = ~Aye, I am angry. I have been thinking more and more of how Fenthick met his end... and how I did nothing to stop it... and I grow even more angry! Fenthick devoted his entire life to the service of justice and the performance of his duty, just as I have. And what did he get for it? Discarded. Discarded by his liege lord to appease the witless masses, discarded by his god for one foolish mistake. Tell me why I shouldn't be angry, <CHARNAME>!~ [NWARI432]
@119 = ~But Fenthick was involved in the deaths of thousands of people!~
@120 = ~Perhaps it's Fenthick you should be angry at.~
@121 = ~Perhaps you are right. You have reason to be angry.~ 
@122 = ~I don't like hearing you talk like this.~
@123 = ~You make him sound like a murderer! It was not Fenthick who created the plague, nor Fenthick that betrayed the city! He was merely too trusting and too devoted to duty!~ [ARIBE434]
@124 = ~Aye. Fenthick deserves plenty of my ire, as well. The stupid, stupid fool! If only he had been less trusting, less devoted, he never would have ended as he did!~ [NWARI458]
@125 = ~Aye. I should be angry at those who condemned Fenthick for the wrong reasons. I should be angry at Fenthick, too, for being a good man and a trusting fool!~ [NWARI460]
@126 = ~And why shouldn't I talk like this? If Fenthick had questioned more and been less trusting, less devoted, perhaps he would be alive today!~ [NWARI461]
@127 = ~And so Fenthick got his final reward. Thank you, Tyr, Lord of Justice, for aiding your faithful servant! Shall I be next, then? Shall I, too, end my life a traitor, executed for being too adhered to my duty to question an injustice when I see it? Will Tyr abandon me then, too?~ [NWARI436] 
@128 = ~You sound as if you're losing your faith.~
@129 = ~Don't talk like that! Stop it, this isn't like you!~
@130 = ~Finally I think you're seeing the light!~
@131 = ~I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>. Tyr brought me here, put me on this path. I want to know why. Why teach me true justice and then throw it in my face?~ [NWARI438]
@132 = ~And what *is* like me, <CHARNAME>? Tyr brought me to this place and put me on this path and taught me the meaning of justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!~ [NWARI456]
@133 = ~I have had no revelation... only questions upon questions. Tyr put me on this path, taught me true justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!~ [NWARI456]
@134 = ~All I know is that... I am tired of being sad. I am tired of feeling helpless. I feel guilty for questioning myself... but I feel I must be questioned. Vengeance is not Tyr's way, but I... I fear I see no justice being done, here. There is no justice to be had for Fenthick, only vengeance... and I cannot do it. Perhaps it is just... the dreams. They continue to come, and get worse each night, <CHARNAME>. I hear voices crying out, so many voices...~ [NWARI439] 
@135 = ~The dreams have gotten worse?~
@136 = ~This is bad. Perhaps we should return to Neverwinter.~
@137 = ~I think you really may be going mad!~
@138 = ~Aye. I see Fenthick killed before me, over and over. I hear laughter, and so many crying out to me for help. I almost cannot bear it.~ [NWARI442]
@139 = ~No. No, there is nothing for me there. And doing so would only hinder your mission... and I will not do that.~ [NWARI452]
@140 = ~Perhaps I am, at that. I can think of only one thing that would soothe my thoughts.~ [NWARI452]
@141 = ~Promise me, <CHARNAME>... promise me as my dearest friend that you will find this cult and visit upon them the vengeance that I cannot!~ [NWARI443]
@142 = ~I promise.~
@143 = ~I can't promise that, Aribeth.~
@144 = ~I don't think that will help you.~
@145 = ~You are mad!~
@146 = ~Thank you, my friend. It... it is all I can think of to silence the dreams. I must do something, and to have you help me brings me great relief.~ [NWARI444]
@147 = ~I see. It is all I can think of that will silence the dreams. Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps all I need is some rest to put this into proper perspective.~ [NWARI451]
@148 = ~And I thought you were a friend. I see that no one understands what I am going through... aye, so be it. Leave me be, then, <CHARNAME>, and return to your mission. We need discuss my feelings no further.~ [NWARI454] 
@149 = ~You have been a fine friend, <CHARNAME>. Here... take this. It is a ring that belonged to my father. I want you to have it. Let it symbolize our friendship. Perhaps if... something were to happen to me... it would remind you of me in days to come...~ [NWARI445] 
@150 = ~What do you mean?~
@151 = ~Very well, I will take it.~
@152 = ~No, I don't want it.~
@153 = ~I don't mean anything, my friend. It is... simply fatigue and worry that make me speak such. Please... take the ring.~ [NWARI447]
@154 = ~That makes me glad. You do me a great honor by carrying it. Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.~ [NWARI448]
@155 = ~Then throw it away, if our friendship means nothing to you. I hope that is not the case. Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.~ [NWARI450]
@156 = ~Your information tells us that the cult likely lies within the Host Tower in Luskan. You need to find a way to gain entrance into Luskan and into the tower, itself. Aarin should be able to help you toward that end. We will both meet you in the city, afterwards, to help you further.~ [NWARI462]
@157 = ~I wish there were better leads we could send you on, <CHARNAME>, to track down the cult... but Aarin's information is the best we have. All I can suggest is that you visit the locales Aarin has mentioned and keep your ears open for unusual activities. Not everything that is unusual will be the doing of this cult, obviously... but they are out there, and active, so there is always a good chance you will discover them if you are alert.~ [NWARI464] 
@158 = ~I would suggest you speak to Aarin Gend and find out where to focus your efforts in finding evidence of the cult.~ [NWARI467]
@159 = ~It is of vital importance that you complete Lord Nasher's mission, <CHARNAME>. Much depends on you discovering what else Desther's allies have planned. Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?~ [NWARI474] 
@160 = ~I'm going now.~
@161 = ~I am pleased to see that you remain safe, my friend. Lord Nasher tells me he is confident of your success, though I do worry at the danger in which you place yourself. Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?~ [NWARI475] 
@162 = ~It is good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. At times I worry that you have taken on too much responsibility yourself, yet always you surprise me with your resourcefulness and success. Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?~ [NWARI476] 
@163 = ~I am sorry, but I cannot discuss Neverwinter's business with you. Let <CHARNAME> come to me. I will only talk to them.~
