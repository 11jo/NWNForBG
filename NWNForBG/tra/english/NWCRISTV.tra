@0 = ~Hmm? Leave me be, I got nothing to say. Can't be seen with the likes of you.~ [NWCRIS51]
@1 = ~I just need some information about the auction.~
@2 = ~Aribeth and Lord Nasher compel me to investigate here.~
@3 = ~NP: Then I will, sorry to bother you.~ /*Fine, sorry to bother you.*/
@4 = ~I said I can't be seen speaking with you. Get lost.~
@5 = ~NP: Jalek put on a good show. He's a little crazy, even for the Blood Sailors, but he's a good guy. Smarter than it seems at first glance. Well, you've gained his trust, which means I can take the risk of talking to you, but try not to make any noise, okay? The absence of Vengaul makes everyone nervous.~ [NWCRIS53] /*You've gained his confidence, though, and that means I can risk talking to you, but keep your questions quiet, all right? Vengaul's absence has everyone on edge.*/
@6 = ~I have questions about you.~
@7 = ~I have questions about this place.~
@8 = ~I need to ask about the Bloodsailors and Vengaul.~
@9 = ~It's time for me to leave.~
@10 = ~NP: I trust you. True, I will not answer most of the questions, but you can still ask them.~ /*I'm sure you do. I won't be able to answer most of them, but you may ask.*/
@11 = ~Who are you? Why are you here?~
@12 = ~Why are you nervous about who you speak to?~
@13 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@14 = ~Ask what you will, though you have probably already figured out most of what I might say.~
@15 = ~Is the Seedy Tavern well guarded?~
@16 = ~Why are so many people here?~
@17 = ~My mission within the Bloodsailors is not focused on what you seek, but I will try to answer.~
@18 = ~If Vengaul is their leader, where is he?~
@19 = ~Do the Bloodsailors approve of this public auction?~
@20 = ~Very well, but take this key to get downstairs. It is the only copy I have. You'll still have to get by the Chef, though.~
@21 = ~NP: These are reasonable questions, as long as you don't answer them out loud. I'm Kristov, and I'm here for the same reason you are: I want to learn more about the Blood Sailors. In truth, I'm not from Neverwinter, and the people I represent hope to find old allies among the Blood Sailors. A vision for the distant future. You have more pressing matters than mine, and I will try not to disturb you if you do the same for me.~ /*In truth, I'm not from Neverwinter, and the group I represent is hoping to locate some old allies of the Bloodsailors. Longterm goals.*/
@22 = ~NP: Jalek has been assigned as my caretaker, which means he oversees everything I do. It's part of the Blood Sailors initiation. If I start talking to someone he does not know, he will try to find out where this acquaintance came from. And politely he will not ask. Basically, I'm more concerned about others. I know that you do not need extra attention. I really understand it.~ /*If I struck up a conversation with someone he didn't recognize, he would have to determine how I knew the other person. He would not ask gently.*/
@23 = ~Ask what you will, but do not speak too loudly.~
@24 = ~NP: Fine. I think you're safe here, but if you go downstairs, the Blood Sailors guards will immediately attack you. Now no one is allowed downstairs. Something is happening. Maybe we should talk more about this.~ /*Well enough. I think you will be fine in the main area here, but if you go downstairs Bloodsailor guards will attack on sight.*/
@25 = ~NP: Most of these people came to the auction, which was supposed to take place here. Vengaul spread rumors that one of the ingredients for a pestilence cure would be exhibited. It seems to have been canceled and I think I know why. You must go down if you want to know more. This case concerns the Bloodsail.~ /*Most of the people here came for the auction that was supposed to happen. Vengaul apparently spread rumors that he had part of a plague cure.*/
@26 = ~NP: Vengaul is not here yet, and I doubt he will come. Perhaps he just wants to stir up interest, but heating up the crowd is not in his habit. Vengaul is an artist by nature. He wouldn't disappoint people, especially after his efforts to make the auction known to everyone.~ /*Vengaul is a showman. He does not like to disappoint, especially after taking such pains to make sure the auction was well-known.*/
@27 = ~You think he deliberately spread word of it?~
@28 = ~NP: Vengaul is an old school adventure lover. He loves to be famous in well-staged performances. Some of his people really don't like it. You see, some of them think that their actions would be much more effective if they stopped worrying about public opinion and stuff.~ /*You see, some of them feel that they could be far more effective if they stopped worrying about public opinion and such.*/
@29 = ~You are talking about a revolt.~
@30 = ~NP: Maybe. If the rumors turn out to be true and he does have the cure, he wants to gain attention so he can increase his price. Either this is the case, or he wanted someone specific to know about it. He had been trying to hook Lord Nasher for a very long time to get him going. Despite this, it seems his plans have changed. I don't think Vengaul is in complete control of the situation now.~ /*That, or maybe he wanted someone very important to hear of it. He's had a long history of trying to bait Lord Nasher into action.*/
@31 = ~NP: I don't know... His lieutenant Kallik is an impatient and greedy man... I can't say anything more about this. Perhaps some measures were taken to get rid of the old man. You should look for answers below. I'm sorry, but there's nothing more I can tell you.~ /*There may have been some... steps taken to try and oust the old man. You should seek your answers downstairs. I'm sorry, I can't say anymore.*/
@32 = ~Hello. I've said too much already, but I suppose I can risk answering a few questions if you really need the information.~ [NWCRIS52]
@33 = ~Very well. I've already given out the key I had for downstairs. If you don't have it, you'll have to find another way past the door, and deal with Chef.~
@34 = ~Looks like things are settling down. There's no reason for you to talk to me. Good job, but please leave.~ [NWCRIS50]
