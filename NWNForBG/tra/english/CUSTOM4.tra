@3 = ~NP: Hey, buddy, don't get your blood in my beer.~ /*Whoah, don't get your blood in my beer, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
@4 = ~Must you brandish that thing about up here? Save it for the cellars!~
@5 = ~NP: Yeah, you'd be fun to watch in the ring. The crowd would love it.~ /*Aye, you'd be a good one to watch in the ring. Just enough panache to win the crowd.*/
@6 = ~That must have been some fight you were in. Did you take the prize?~
@7 = ~NP: Stop waving your weapons around. This is no place for that up here.~ /*Stop waving that about, will you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? Upstairs ain't the place for it.*/
@8 = ~NP: Greetings, <LADYLORD>! How are things going at the tavern?~ /*Good <DAYNIGHT> to you, <PRO_LADYLORD>! How runs the tavern?*/
@9 = ~Well, wonderful. More <PRO_RACE> scum wandering about. If that isn't all we need.~
@10 = ~NP: Be careful of the people in this town. All they think about is ripping someone off. No kidding.~ /*Be wary of the humans in this town. They'll tax you extra for your <PRO_RACE> blood, I'm not joking.*/
