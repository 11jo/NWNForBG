@0 = ~MT: I will only speak to you if you have an important matter. I've got good drinks here and the waitress is making eyes at me. And they are not like yours!~ /*This better be good. I've got a fine drink going and that waitress is makin' eyes much prettier than yers.*/
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose. Make it quick, though. I have ever so many places to be. Yeah, right.~
@4 = ~Where can I go to get some action?~
@5 = ~Aribeth tolerates mercenaries when Neverwinter has a standing militia?~
@6 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@7 = ~Get on, then. I've drinking to get to.~
@8 = ~But you know all this. I see you've got a pass for the Gauntlet in the Board Laid Bare tavern already. It's in the Blacklake district.~
@9 = ~MT: Now, we speak the same language. There is one place... Hmm... Yes, you are good with weapons. Just don't talk about it. You don't need everyone to know. There is a club for battles. It's called &quot;Glove&quot;. If you want to relax, go there. I can sell you a pass, it costs 250 gold.~ /*It's a club for fighting. We call it the Gauntlet. If you want action, that's where you go. I can sell you a pass, if you want. 50 gold.*/
@10 = ~Here's my 50 gold.~
@11 = ~MT: I don't have that kind of money, I'll come back later.~ /*"I don't have that much."*/
@12 = ~No, thanks.~
@13 = ~MT: Now, we speak the same language. There is one place... Hmm... I was going to say &quot;The Glove&quot;, but you have a fourth round medal! You've made it to the end, my friend. They defeated everyone.~ /*I was gonna say the Gauntlet, but you got the fourth round medal on you right now! That's it for you, friend. You're at the top.*/
@14 = ~I don't know. This place is pretty much just for weapon fighting. No fancy stuff, just straight out brawling.~
@15 = ~You can tell me. I'm up for it.~
@16 = ~Come now, there shouldn't be secrets among <PRO_RACE> kind.~
@17 = ~Tell me or I will get violent!~
@18 = ~MT: Watch your language, mate! Do you think no one noticed that when several guards died, she hired outlanders like you instead of contacting us? Just because we work for the highest bidder doesn't mean we wouldn't help the city.~ /*Watch your mouth, friend. It hasn't gone unnoticed that when a few of the city guards died, she hired outsiders like you instead of coming here.*/
@19 = ~I know a sword can't stop it, and that makes me worthless right now. No one is hiring, except the odd noble trying to prevent looting.~
@20 = ~MT: And here is your pass. Don't say where you got it, though you're unlikely to be asked. Nobody talks about The Glove, but people find it anyway. The Naked Board tavern is located in the Black Lake area. Give the pass to the bartender. Good luck. You will need it.~ /*And here's your pass. Don't say where you got it, although I doubt they'll ask. Nobody talks about the Gauntlet, but people show up anyway.*/
@21 = ~No, it's better if I don't say anything. There's a rule about the Gauntlet. I forget what it is, though, because nobody talks about it.~
@22 = ~Would I be a mercenary if I scared that easy? Right. Just back away, friend. You don't want trouble here.~
@23 = ~Here there, friend. I suppose I got time to chat. Trade o' Blades ain't very busy today, and I'm gettin' nowhere with this waitress.~
@24 = ~What does you want, ha? Come on, you don't interrupt a Trade of Blades merc without good reason.~
