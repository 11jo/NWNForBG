@0 = ~Hmm... I recognize you. You are one of the new recruits under Aribeth, are you not? I'm sorry, but this is the spellcasters' guild. It will not interest you.~ [ELTUR050]
@1 = ~I need some spellcasting equipment.~
@2 = ~Farewell, then.~
@3 = ~Yes, this will do quite well. Come, let us take a look at what we have to offer you then, shall we?~
@4 = ~MT: I wish you have a good time<DAYNIGHT> ,<SIRMAAM> . Please come again.~ /*I wish you a good <DAYNIGHTALL>, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Please come back again.*/
@5 = ~Well, hello, <CHARNAME>. I had heard there was a new magic adept in service to the city. The guild of the Many-Starred Cloak welcomes you.~ [ELTUR052]
@6 = ~What kind of guild is this?~
@7 = ~I would like to join the guild.~
@8 = ~MT: I didn't give my name, how do you know it?~ /*Me not tell name. How you know?*/
@9 = ~I must be on my way.~
@10 = ~MT: I thought it was obvious. This tower contains the entire heritage of Neverwinter, the invaluable experience of practicing the magical arts. We are the Starcloak, and our goal is to unleash the full potential of each of the students. We provide access to our magical inventory and free passage to the Cloak Tower. Do you want to join our guild?~ /*We provide access to our magical inventories, as well as free passage throughout the Cloaktower. Would you care to become a part of our guild?*/
@11 = ~MT: Well, I'm glad to hear it. But before joining a guild, you need to show that you have some important abilities to a sufficient extent. In the first test, you must show that you yourself can get the necessary knowledge and apply it in a completely different area. I'll help you, tell you where to start. Find these four things and then bring them to me.~ /*Well, I'm glad to hear that. But before you can join the guild, you have to be able to show competence in several important areas of ability.*/
@12 = ~Well, if *that's* the greatest of your curiosities, then this is going to be an interesting conversation - of that I am certain!~
@13 = ~Well, far be it from me to keep you from your duties. Visit again when you have need of us. Farewell.~
@14 = ~MT: You must find the following four things: a piece of clay, a flask of water, a patch of fog and a little splinter. Remember the order well. These items can be found in the Starcloak's hidden labs throughout the city. These buildings are marked with special signs. Take this key. Be careful, the laboratories are protected from those who are just preparing to enter us. Come back to me when you get all four items.~ /*Take this key. Beware, as the laboratories are guarded against would-be initiates. Return to me when you have the four items.*/
@15 = ~MT: Cloak Tower Challenge I'm trying to join the local Starcloak Mage Guild. In the shimmering main hall of the Cloak Tower in the Heart of the City, Guildmaster Eltura Sarptil gave me the key to the guild laboratories scattered throughout the city, from there I need to bring four items: a piece of clay, a vial of water, a patch of fog and a torch. She warned me about the dangers that await me on my way, as all these items are well guarded. Once I have obtained all four items, I will need to report to Eltura to pass whatever final test she deems necessary for me.~ /*I have applied for membership into the local guild of magic, the Many-Starred Cloak. In the Cloaktower, their glistening guild hall in the City Core, the guild leader, Eltoora Sarptyl, bestowed upon me a key to the guild's various laboratories throughout the city. Each is marked with a sundial and from them I am to retrieve four items: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. She said to mark well the order, whatever that may mean. She also warned to expect dangers along my path, as the four items do not go unguarded.
Once I have obtained all four items, I am to present myself to Eltoora for whatever other tests she may deem necessary.*/
@16 = ~Hello, <CHARNAME>. Are we back to continue on with our next round of challenges? Or did we have something else in mind?~ [ELTUR051]
@17 = ~Evaluate me for guild membership.~
@18 = ~You were sent for four reagents and you have them. Well done. Now you shall face a test of mind and body.~
@19 = ~MT: You will be teleported to a room where you will need to destroy one of my mechanisms. You will find the tools there, it will make your task easier. Use the knowledge gained in the first test, and the next stage will be easier, if you leave without destroying the mechanism, it will be counted as a failure. When you're ready, tell me about it, I'll teleport you to the testing room.~ /*Use the knowledge from my first task and this test will be simple, but if you leave before the automaton is destroyed, you have failed. Are you ready?*/
@20 = ~Yep.~
@21 = ~MT: Cloak Tower Challenge I'm trying to join the local Starcloak Mage Guild. In the shimmering main hall of the Cloak Tower in the Heart of the City, Guild Master Eltura Sarptil took four items from me: a piece of clay, a vial of water, a patch of mist, and a torch. Now another test awaits me - to destroy the golem.~ /*I have applied for membership into the local guild of magic, the Many-Starred Cloak. In the Cloaktower, their glistening guild hall in the City Core, the guild leader, Eltoora Sarptyl, took from me four items: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. She said to mark well the order, whatever that may mean. With that done, she has directed me toward a magical portal within the tower. My test, it seems, continues on the other side...*/
@22 = ~No.~
@23 = ~MT: You have to test the body and mind. You will be teleported to a room where you will need to destroy one of my mechanisms. You will find the tools there, it will make your task easier. If you leave without destroying the mechanism, it will be counted as a failure. Ready?~ /*You will be teleported to a room where you must destroy one of my automatons. Tools will be found there that will simplify the task.*/
@24 = ~MT: You were sent for four components, and you don't have them. Come back when they are. You must find the following four things: a piece of clay, a flask of water, a patch of fog and a little splinter. Remember the order well.~ /*The four items that you must find are: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. Mark well the order.*/
@25 = ~MT: You tried to destroy the mechanism and failed. There is a penalty for failure, but this is more of a sign that you want to continue. If you want to pass the test again, the fine will lighten your wallet. A &quot;donation&quot; of 500 gold for the guild is fine.~ /*You have tried to destroy the automaton and have failed. There is a penalty for failure, but it is more a token gesture of your intent to continue.*/
@26 = ~Here is my 200 gold. Let me take the test again.~
@27 = ~MT: I'll try later.~ /*I will attempt it.*/
@28 = ~MT: Congratulations! You have shown great ingenuity! For destroying my mechanism, you get a place in the Starcloak guild. I give you the symbol of the guild. Wear this cloak with pride and know that the guild will be ready to help you from now on.~ /*Congratulations. You have shown great ingenuity. By destroying my automaton you have earned a place in the Many-Starred Cloak.*/
@29 = ~Having passed Eltoora's test, I have now received the mantle of the Many-Starred Cloak and have become a member of the guild. Aside from the prestige and other benefits, it will also grant me more complete access to their stores of magical supplies, that I might make a better practice of my craft.~
@30 = ~Then return when you are.~
@31 = ~MT: You have to test the body and mind. You will be teleported to a room where you will need to destroy one of my mechanisms. You will find the tools there, it will make your task easier. If you leave without destroying the mechanism, it will be counted as a failure.~ /*You will be teleported to a room where you must destroy one of my automatons. Tools will be found there that will simplify the task.*/
@32 = ~Welcome, member. What do you require?~ [ELTUR053]
@33 = ~Have you special equipment available for guild members?~
@34 = ~MT: Yes, there are special equipment for sale for guild members. Here, take a look.~ /*You are unable to view this companion's inventory.*/
@35 = ~MT: Congratulations! You have shown great ingenuity! For destroying my mechanism, you will receive a place in the Starcloak guild. I give you the symbol of the guild. Wear this cloak with pride and know that the guild will be ready to help you from now on. You can also use the laboratory on the top floor of the tower.~ /*Congratulations. You have shown great ingenuity. By destroying my automaton you have earned a place in the Many-Starred Cloak.*/
