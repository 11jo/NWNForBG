@0 = ~Aye? I s'pose yer here for the bloody dungeon, too, eh?~
@1 = ~What... dungeon?~
@2 = ~Yeah, that's me: here for the dungeon.~
@3 = ~No, I'm just passing through the area.~
@4 = ~Yes, of course. It should make for an interesting challenge.~
@5 = ~I will leave.~
@6 = ~What do you know? You don't know nothin'. Hmph. Pay me a hundred gold an' I'll tell you what's what, if yer interested.~
@7 = ~All right, here. 100 gold.~
@8 = ~MT: I will give you 100.~ /*I'll give you 50.*/
@9 = ~You *will* tell me. NOW!~
@10 = ~Forget it.~
@11 = ~MT: It’s even interesting where this Mutamin advertises his competition. All the local rich people will come to watch us risk our asses and crawl through the dungeon. You and I both know that it takes a good thief to see through all these traps. And this is *me*. So you can go straight home.~ /*One 'as to wonder where Mutamin's been advertisin' his contest. Nobles here from all over the place come to watch us crawl through a dungeon.*/
@12 = ~MT: You don't have to worry. I will do it.~ /*You need not worry of me. Me do this.*/
@13 = ~Oh, please. I've spit out the likes of you for breakfast.~
@14 = ~That sounds like a horrible contest!~
@15 = ~Izzat so? Pardon me if I don't believe you. A rogue can't be too careful when he's about to come into a big reward, ye know.~
@16 = ~MT: Hm. 'Fun test,' oh my ass. Do you know how much the bigwigs will pay Mutamin to watch us die, huh? Well ... let's see, then, who will get the jackpot from Mutamin, and who will be gutted to the delight of a few filthy aristocrats, mm?~ /*Hmph. 'Interesting challenge,' my arse. You knows how many nobles Mutamin charges a fortune to watch us die, eh?*/
@17 = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just don't get too drunk or I'll be pullin' off yer boots for you later. Ha!~
@18 = ~MT: Well, do you see the owner? This is Mutamin. A former adventurer, and I'll tell you, he was lucky. He doesn’t peck money now, people say. And he made a contest. There is a dungeon under this place, and the dungeon is full of all sorts of critters and traps. Whoever goes through the dungeon will receive a reward.~ /*He's put on a contest. There's a dungeon below this place, filled with monsters and traps. If someone gets through it, they gets the reward.*/
@19 = ~It's all illegal as hades, but the nobles love comin' fer a good watch. Everyone knows a thief will take it, an' that's *me.* So you should run home, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.~
@20 = ~I thinks you be needin' to clean out them <PRO_RACE> ears o' yours. I said 100 gold, not 50. You want to know or not?~
@21 = ~What? Unless I tell you about this dungeon? You wouldn't dare touch me: not here, not down below. Bugger off already.~
@22 = ~Have it yer way, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Best be runnin' home to yer mother, I can hears her teats leakin'.~
@23 = ~Well... we'll jus' see who makes it through an' gets Mutamin's reward an' who gets gutted fer the pleasure o' a few jaded aristocrats, mm?~
@24 = ~Har har! Now *that's* the kind o' spirit I like to hear in a competitor! Har har! Ye'll never get the reward with that attitude, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.~
@25 = ~MT: You again? You want to know about the dungeons, right?~ /*What you want know about caves, yip?*/
@26 = ~MT: I already know everything.~ /*I don't think so.*/
@27 = ~Git along. I've got me own troubles.~
@28 = ~Bah! Yer not good enough by half, <PRO_GIRLBOY>! Ye best not get in me way in yon dungeon, or I'll treat ye like any other beastie I encounter! Got that?~
@29 = ~Ha! I told ye not to enter the bloody dungeon, fool! An' now I be forced to hack ye down where ye stand. So be it!~
