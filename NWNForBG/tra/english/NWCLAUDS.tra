@0 = ~NP: Newbie? Fine! Remember: you go through one round at a time, and for each victory you get a medal. Its just for the glory. No cash rewards. Of course, if you pass all three rounds, you will have to fight me. Then you can win this whole bar! Trust me, this wont happen.~ [NWCLAUD5] /*New blood? Good! Remember, you fight one round at a time and get a medal for each victory. It's for glory alone. There's no prize.*/
@1 = ~NP: Have you defeated Hrask? Not surprising. Hes been here for weeks and hasnt won a single round. He led the rounds but didnt win a single one. He cant beat me, and no one can. Thats why I bet the bar. Nobody even wants to try.~ [NWCLAUD4] /*You beat Hrusk, eh? Not surprising. He's been here weeks and hasn't got out of round one. He's ruled it, but he hasn't gotten past it.*/
@2 = ~NP: You... Defeated Fashi, huh? You probably think that you are the strongest?! Shouldnt be recognized. Agar will put you in your place. And if not him, then me. Nobody can beat me. If you think you will walk out of here as the owner of MY bar, you are wrong!~ [NWCLAUD3] /*And if he doesn't, I will. Nobody beats me. If you think you'll walk out of here with MY bar, you are mistaken!*/
@3 = ~That's it for you! You got past Agar, but it stops here. No one beats Claudus. Just ask! No one beats me! This place is mine!~ [NWCLAUD2]
@4 = ~Damn you! Damn you all! Fine! You won! So what! Proves nothing! I was Champion for months! Everyone knows that! Everyone knows...~ [NWCLAUD0]
@5 = ~Take the place. Go on, you are the owner now, but I've told my friends to leave. The Gauntlet goes with me! BAH!~
