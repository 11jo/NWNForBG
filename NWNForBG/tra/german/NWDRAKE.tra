@0 = ~Greetings. Harben told me to expect additional troops arriving. Let me tell you, you are much needed here. I've never seen an infestation like this. Undead fester over time, but here, they rise before a corpse even cools.~ [NWDRA050] 
@1 = ~I've seen how dangerous the undead can be.~
@2 = ~Maybe somebody less squeamish should replace you.~
@3 = ~I will lend my assistance where required.~
@4 = ~What we need right now is some order in the streets. People need help, first and foremost. We need you. Once people are safe we can find the source of these undead and get down their throats. I'm sure Harben agrees and will reward people accordingly for helping.~
@5 = ~Tell me of any people that need immediate help.~
@6 = ~I'll poke around on my own without your guidance.~
@7 = ~Where do you think the threat originates from?~
@8 = ~Ha! I wish that were possible. I fight undead. If you can add to my experience, then good, but we gain nothing as adversaries. What we need right now is some order in the streets. People need help, first and foremost. We need you. Once people are safe we can find the source of these undead and get down their throats. I'm sure Harben agrees and will reward people accordingly for helping.~
@9 = ~The lad Krestal and the lad Jemanie were spotted barricaded in their homes. More houses may be overrun. Krestal and Jemanie may also know of some strange happenings in the area, but we have not been able to interview them as yet.~ 
@10 = ~Tell me of Krestal.~
@11 = ~Tell me of Jemanie.~
@12 = ~I will look into it.~
@13 = ~If you learn anything, keep us informed. We must know what we're dealing with, and if it's connected to the plague.~

@15 = ~Unknown. We don't have the men for simple information gathering. It's vital we find out what is going on, and if it's plague-related.~
@16 = ~His house is located in the eastern part of the district center. He is usually with a gang but they appear to have disappeared.~ 
@17 = ~Jemanie's home is in the west central section of the district. He has a brother too, but I have no news of him.~
@18 = ~Ah, I have heard of the impact you are making in Neverwinter. Good to know you are on our side today. I've never seen an infestation like this. Undead fester over time, but here, they rise before a corpse even cools.~ [NWDRA051] 
@19 = ~Ahh, you have returned to me. Do you need me to repeat my earlier information, or have you something else?~ [NWDRA052]
@20 = ~Go over what is required.~
@21 = ~Have you found any new information?~
@22 = ~We need people safe, first of all. We also need to find out what is causing this infestation. The undead don't simple get up. Something has to drag them back from the other side.~
@23 = ~Anyone need immediate help?~
@24 = ~I've heard a thing or two about the Sword Coast Boys and a Snake Cult, though you probably already know this. It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.~ 
@25 = ~Tell me about the Sword Coast Boys.~
@26 = ~Tell me about this Snake Cult.~
@27 = ~Goodbye.~
@28 = ~I've heard a thing or two about the Sword Coast Boys, though you probably already know this. It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.~
@29 = ~I've heard a thing or two about a Snake Cult, though you probably already know this. It was probably your efforts that brought this information to light. Forgive me if I repeat something you know all too well.~
@30 = ~I haven't heard anything new. Sure could use someone out there to poke around and get some answers.~
@31 = ~Krestal in the west, north of the Helmite shrine, and Jemanie in the center of the east edge of the district. Their homes are in overrun areas, and we don't know if they are alive or not. Hopefully something can be learned from the people we save. I have runners in the area that may be able to inform us if guards like you find anything. Just ask if we've found anything new.~
@32 = ~Krestal in the west, north of the Helmite shrine. His home is in an overrun area and we don't know if he's alive or not. Hopefully something can be learned from the people we save. I have runners in the area that may be able to inform us if guards like you find anything. Just ask if we've found anything new.~ 
@33 = ~Jemanie in the center of the east edge of the district. His home is in an overrun area and we don't know if he's alive or not. Hopefully something can be learned from the people we save. I have runners in the area that may be able to inform us if guards like you find anything. Just ask if we've found anything new.~ 
@34 = ~I think most people have been secured here or in the Helmite shrine. Now all that is left is to find what is behind all of this. I hope I can provide you information to help in the investigation.~
@35 = ~Something was corrupting the young. A creature named Gulnan offered power in exchange for complicity. Whoever she is, she will have needed access to the warehouse. Search for passages, and take the fight to her lair. You know the area now, so you spearhead the effort. She has taken advantage of a plague-ravaged city, and must be stopped.~
@36 = ~An organization of malevolent fanatics, following someone named Gulnan. They are entrenched in an estate in the northwest of the Beggar's Nest. She will have needed access to the cult, so there may be passages that lead to her or her lair. You know the area now, so you spearhead the effort. She has taken advantage of a plague-ravaged city, and must be stopped.~
@37 = ~Well, I must say that whatever you did in that bloody graveyard, it seems our immediate troubles are over. There's still the plague, of course, but the undead threat seems to be on the wane in this district.~ [NWDRA054] 
@38 = ~You should report to Aribeth with whatever you found. Oh, Harben may give you something special as well as reward.~
@39 = ~I knew we could count on you to repeat your success in this district. I had heard good things about you. There's still the plague, of course, but the undead threat seems to be on the wane in this district.~ [NWDRA055]
