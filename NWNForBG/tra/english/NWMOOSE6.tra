@0 = ~Thanks for freeing me. I was afraid Zokan would never let me out of that cage!~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~How did you get captured?~
@3 = ~Can you tell me anything about Zokan and the Uthgardt Elk tribe?~
@4 = ~Can you get away from here safely on your own?~
@5 = ~I think it might be fun to slaughter you like a hog.~
@6 = ~My name is Arden. I'm a soldier with the Lords' Alliance. At least I was until Zokan's people captured me.~
@7 = ~I was on a scouting mission when I stumbled onto a group of Elk warriors. I was outnumbered four to one. Lucky for me they decided to show mercy and took me prisoner instead of simply killing me.~
@8 = ~NP: They treated me all right, but I was afraid I would catch the plague. It seems the whole tribe had caught the plague. Their chief, Zokan, came to talk to me. I expected to see a brutal savage, but he seemed a reasonable enough man. Zokan asked if I knew Commander Damas of Fort Ilkard. I didn't know, but it was clear that Zokan hates him. He blames Damas for the epidemic that is killing Utgardt.~ /*They treated me okay, though I was a little worried about catching the plague. Seems the whole tribe is infected. Their chief, Zokan, came and spoke to me a bit. I expected some kind of violent savage, but he seemed like a reasonable man.*/
@9 = ~Why does he blame Damas for the plague?~
@10 = ~Most of the Uthgardt are too sick with plague to even try and stop me. I'll get out of here okay. I wish I had a reward for you, but all I can do is thank you again before I go. So... thanks.~
@11 = ~What? No - I won't die without a fight!~
@12 = ~I don't know why Zokan hates Damas so much. You'd have to ask the Uthgardt chief, I guess. Like that would happen!~
