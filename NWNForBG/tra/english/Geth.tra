@0 = ~What are you doing here? Why have you come? I do not wish to be bothered.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Excuse me. I will leave.~
@3 = ~Geth - at one time a normal man, and not a horrific beast - who hails from Port Llast. Why do you care?~
@4 = ~MT: У меня есть серебряные обереги от Ньюрика.~ /*I have silver charms - from Neurik.*/
@5 = ~What makes you become werewolf?~
@6 = ~MT: Меня послали покончить с оборотнями. Если ты отдашь мне свое кольцо, я уйду и тебя больше не будут искать.~ /*I've been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.*/
@7 = ~I'll try to find some help for you. Stay here.~
@8 = ~I'm here to kill you, Geth. Are you ready?~
@9 = ~Thank you...~
@10 = ~Silver? I might be despondent about my future, but I do not wish it prematurely ended, either.~
@11 = ~If you want to change the future, you must do it yourself.~
@12 = ~This charm comes from Neurik. It is safe.~
@13 = ~Take the charm, or I'll see you dead myself.~
@14 = ~I don't care. I'm killing you now.~
@15 = ~MT: Каратис привел сюда меня и несколько моих друзей: Урта, Брана и Эндера. Он хотел, чтобы мы помогли ему убить оборотня. Звучало все весело, и вот как закончилось. Все побежали. И все мы стали оборотнями, кроме Эндера. Насколько я знаю, его не поймали.~ /*It sounded fun, but this is how it ended. Everyone ran. We all became werewolves except for Ander. As far as I know, he wasn't caught.*/
@16 = ~Do you know where I can find any of them?~
@17 = ~Fine, take it. I need it not. It will not change the course of my life.~
@18 = ~As if I have any interest in going elsewhere. But you wouldn't understand. Fine, farewell - just leave me alone.~
@19 = ~I do not fear death - not as a beast as I am now. If you come for death, then I shall make sure you have it.~
@20 = ~I suppose you're right. If I sit here and do nothing, then nothing will change, right? Fine, give me your silver charm.~
@21 = ~I felt a - flicker of hope. Could it be truth, then? Fine, give me the charm and we will see what happens.~
@22 = ~Karathis told me that I would be safe at his side, and look at me now. No, I think I'll pass on your offer.~
@23 = ~Well, if those are my choices, then I suppose I will take the charm. Death this way or death that way - what does it matter?~
@24 = ~No, I don't. And I grow weary of this conversation. Perhaps we can put it to an end, yes?~
@25 = ~I - am human again! Is this a joke? A dream that I will wake from? Let it be truth! Oh, take my ring, and bring it to Neurik.~
@26 = ~I am overjoyed. I am human again! Thank you, stranger, thank you. I am forever indebted!~
@27 = ~MT: Я - опять человек! Это что - шутка? Или все это видится мне во сне? Хотел бы я, чтобы это оказалось правдой!~ /*I - am human again! Is this a joke? A dream that I will wake from? Let it be truth! Oh, take my ring, and bring it to Neurik.*/
@28 = ~Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can't control... Myself!~
@29 = ~Stop hurting me! I will no longer attack you!~
