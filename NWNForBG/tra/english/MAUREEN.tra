@0 = ~MT: I apologize for the impolite reception,<SIRMAAM> but now I don't care. The plague is taking us one by one, and I can't even hide at home. The peninsula is full of fugitives. They have now taken over all our possessions. Why is nobody doing anything?!~ /*Pardon my improper greeting, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, but I really can't muster the interest today. The plague picks us off one by one, and I can't even hide in my home.*/
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~What can I do to be of assistance?~
@3 = ~Ah, go away. Your weakness disgusts me.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I can't talk to anyone. I don't want to. I just want to be able to go home. Ah, why am I telling you this? You can't take on the whole Peninsula district.~
@6 = ~MT: I... I don't know. You can't handle them all alone... can you? We need a hero... I don't know, maybe it's you. If there is anything you can do to improve the situation on the peninsula, I beg you, do it.~ /*I... I don't know. You can't take on the whole district by yourself... can you? I guess we need a hero... I don't know if that's you.*/
@7 = ~Fare you well. I will be here. There's nowhere else for me to go. Definitely not home.~
@8 = ~MT: I don't need to be reminded how little we can do on our own. We've already been pushed away by so many... the whole peninsula has been taken... Then go, but... please... if you get a chance... please look at the peninsula... Everything we had was left there.~ /*Go then, but... please... if you have a chance... please look into the Penisula... It was all we had.*/
@9 = ~MT: What would you like? Please tell me you're not one of those scoundrels who kicked us out of our homes. I have nothing to steal. I can't even get into my house! The peninsula is full of fugitives. They have now taken over all our possessions. Why is nobody doing anything?!~ /*What do you want? Please tell me you're not one of the thugs that forced us out. I've nothing left to steal. I can't even huddle in my own home anymore.*/
@10 = ~(sob) What are we to do?~
@11 = ~I can't believe someone took the time to help us. Thank you for all you have done. It may not be much, but the Peninsula is where our homes are.~
