@1 = ~Where are the Uthgardt now?~
@2 = ~How did you survive the attack?~
@3 = ~Are you hurt? Is there anything I can do to help?~
@4 = ~NP: We heard their war cries and were able to escape before they found us. But we had to leave our wagons and they stole our goods. We need a helper to get our caravan in order.... OH NO!!! Utgardts are back! Save who can!~ /*We heard their war cries and we were able to run off before they found us. But we had to leave our wagons behind and they looted our goods.*/
