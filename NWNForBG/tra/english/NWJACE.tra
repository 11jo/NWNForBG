@0 = ~Gone... all gone... There's nothing left.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~What happened here?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Does my name matter? I was Jace, but I'm nothing now. It's all gone. My home, my family. They burned it.~
@5 = ~They were sick, you see. They got the Wailing. I took every precaution, but they still got it. I couldn't do anything to help. My children. My wife. All dead. My home? Diseased. What could I do? I burned it. I burned it all.~ /*They were sick, you see. They got the Wailing. I took every precaution, but they still got it. I couldn't do anything to help.*/
@6 = ~You burned down your own home?~
@7 = ~Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8 = ~That's tough luck, all right.~
@9 = ~There's nothing left here... all gone...~
@10 = ~Should I sleep in the bed they died in? Live in the walls that saw them wither? I don't know much about plagues, but I know they spread. We stayed sheltered, gave all the proper offerings, and my family still died. It got in somehow. How could I live there? Even if I didn't get it... I saw my family in every shadow. How could I live there now?~ /*Should I sleep in the bed they died in? Live in the walls that saw them wither? I don't know much about plagues, but I know they spread.*/
@11 = ~No... I don't know. Cure the Wailing Death? How about that? Heh... wouldn't that be something... if it were cured now... too late. No, you can't do anything for me. I've nothing left.~ /*No... I don't know. Cure the Wailing Death? How about that? Heh... wouldn't that be something... if it were cured now... too late.*/
@12 = ~So you have absolutely nothing left at all?~
@13 = ~Yes, that's what I get. Indifference. Who cares about my life... my family, when the whole city is plagued. The Wailing... it's everywhere. This is nothing... we're all nothing. What is my suffering compared to that? It means nothing.~ /*Yes, that's what I get. Indifference. Who cares about my life... my family, when the whole city is plagued. The Wailing... it's everywhere.*/
@14 = ~Well... I guess I have the shirt on my back, but I should probably burn that too. I'll have to buy another at the Twenty in a Quiver, I suppose.~
@15 = ~Ah-HA! If you can buy a shirt, you've got gold! Give it to me!~
@16 = ~W-what?! Is that all you want? Filthy thief! No! I say no! What are you going to do, kill me? So what! I've got nothing to live for anyway! Go ahead!~
@17 = ~I won't kill you. I'll say you killed your family. You'll rot in prison for their murders!~
@18 = ~I'm sorry. I lost my head for a moment. I apologize.~
@19 = ~You... you monster! I'd never be able to prove I didn't do it, not with a guard like you saying I did. No one would let me mourn... no one would look at me the same again... Take it, you evil, evil piece of <RACE> waste. Leave me to my ashes... LEAVE ME!!~ /**/
@20 = ~Whatever. Look, why don't you just leave me alone. I don't really want to talk to anyone right now.~
@21 = ~Get away from me, you evil sack of filth! Get away from my ashes!~
