@0 = ~Well then, what would a person of your manners be doing here? I've only a minute, so your introduction must be quick. Too much to do.~ [HARBEN50]
@1 = ~<CHARNAME> is my name. I'm helping Aribeth.~
@2 = ~What is my name to you? Why should I tell you?~
@3 = ~I've no time to speak right now. Farewell.~
@4 = ~You're one of the new guards? Land and lord, why didn't you say so? Your job will be finding the source of the zombie infestation.~
@5 = ~NP: It is you? I thought they were going to send green recruits, but Ive heard rumors that youve already helped find those damned Waterdeep creatures! Nice to see you here. There is complete madness going on here. We are threatened by zombies, and your task will be to find out who is behind all this.~ /*That's you? I expected green recruits, but I've heard how you've been helping find those blasted Waterdhavian creatures already! Glad you've come.*/
@6 = ~And why wouldn't you? Goodness, you are making this unnecessarily difficult. Tell me or don't, but I have a lot to do.~
@7 = ~You've got no time? Well, join the bloody club. Go on then, and don't come back unless you're someone willing to help.~
@8 = ~We've been up to our necks in undead. Even deeper for short folk like me. The Beggar's Nest is just a mess, it is.~
@9 = ~Are the undead linked to the plague? When did this start?~
@10 = ~Is there an identifiable enemy behind this?~
@11 = ~Are there any safe locations in the district?~
@12 = ~A Waterdhavian creature was in another district. Think there's one here?~
@13 = ~Do you know anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~Who are you? What is your role here?~
@15 = ~NP: There are rumors about a local gang called the Sword Coast Boys. I dont know much, but I think theyre connected to this case. Perhaps I will tell you what you already know. I can only repeat what the guards say. Most likely, you have already heard it yourself.~ /*I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.*/
@16 = ~Tell me about the Sword Coast Boys.~
@17 = ~Go over the basic run down of the area.~
@18 = ~Goodbye.~
@19 = ~NP: There are rumors about a local sect, or something like that. I dont know much about it, but they seem to pose a threat. Perhaps I will tell you what you already know. I can only repeat what the guards say. Most likely, you have already heard it yourself.~ /*I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.*/
@20 = ~Tell me about this local Cult.~
@21 = ~NP: There are rumors about the Sword Coast Boys, a local cult or something. I think they have something to do with the undead. Perhaps I will tell you what you already know. I can only repeat what the guards say. Most likely, you have already heard it yourself.~ /*I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.*/
@22 = ~NP: I dont know if these events are related. Not all victims of the plague become undead, but some do not even have time to fall to the ground, as they turn into zombies. But the plague appeared here before the zombies, and in just a few days, a whole horde of the undead was here.~ /*Don't know if the two are linked. Not all plague victims become undead, but the ones that do hardly hit the ground before rising.*/
@23 = ~If I find out anything I'll let you know.~
@24 = ~NP: If only I knew. As I said, this will be your task. You find out who is behind this and destroy them. Of course, there are always rumors, but now nothing can be trusted, and I dont have time to chat with everyone.~ /*I wish I knew. Like I said, that will be your job. You find out who's behind this and take 'em out.*/
@25 = ~What rumors have you heard?~
@26 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@27 = ~NP: Well, you seem to be in one of them, smart guy. The Temple of the Helmites is also safe, but there you will have to listen to their tedious blessings. I have nothing against them. They give people hope, but all their attempts to sprinkle holy water so far have no effect on the plague.~ /*Well, you're kinda standing in one, smarty. The Helmite temple is another, though you have to suffer their soggy blessings.*/
@28 = ~NP: Aribeth sent you to look for these creatures, huh? Well, you shouldnt talk about it to everyone and everyone. If the people find out that we might lose the cure... Im sorry, but I dont know where they could have gone. Moreover, I canâ€™t say for sure that they ever existed at all. Im more worried about zombies now.~ /*I'm sorry, but I don't know where those things might have gone, and I ain't even sure what they were. I got zombies to worry about now.*/
@29 = ~NP: I? Harben Ashensmith. I have an unofficial title because the locals respect me. A long time ago I did something and made some friends. Someone had to show up to help people. Maybe I dont have a uniform, but things are going well for me. So whats your business?~ /*Someone had to step up and help. I may not have a uniform, but I get things done. Now, what's on your mind?*/
@30 = ~NP: A guy named Crestal is afraid that the Sword Coast Boys have made a deal with some unusual creature. Their leader, Drol, has turned into a powerful undead creature. These are disturbing rumors, but I dont have enough men to send them out to search the warehouse the gang is using as a base. Maybe you will agree to do it? Its in the north central part of the Beggars Nest, but be careful. Drol apparently killed all of his rivals... including many members of his own gang.~ /*A lad named Krestal fears that the Sword Coast Boys have made a deal with a strange creature. Their leader, Drawl, has become a powerful undead.*/
@31 = ~NP: It seems to be a cult of snake worship. They are in league with a being named Gulnan. Gulnan... How do I know this name... Oh my God. It was written on one of the boxes that came from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures there. In the name of the abyss, what could we bring that would cause such turmoil? I will ask about it when they open Nevers Castle, by all means!~ /*Gulnan... Where have I heard that... Oh boy. That name was on one of the crates brought from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures.*/
@32 = ~Careful out there. And remember, I'll make your efforts worth your while.~

@35 = ~NP: Thats the way things are. I understand that you should just maintain order, but we are in a stalemate. You find out whats going on, and Ill reward you generously, and even help you complete Aribeths quest. Then go. And dont forget to talk to Drake if you havent already. He is an old undead hunter.~ /*Here's the thing. I know you're just supposed to keep the peace, but we're up against a wall here.*/
@36 = ~NP: I repeat. I dont have time to talk to everyone. But there are a couple of people who say they know something. Their names are Crestal and Jemani. I dont know much about them. Crestal lives west of the Helmite Temple. Jemani lives in the northwest. I think Drake will tell you about them too. Hes trying to organize a rescue operation. Thats all I know.~ /*Like I said, I haven't had time to talk to anyone about it, but a couple of boys have said they heard things. Krestal and Jemanie.*/
@37 = ~What do you need to know?~
@38 = ~Seach that estate top to bottom. This Gulnan creature had to contact them somehow, and it wasn't by knocking on the door.~
@39 = ~Is the creature justified? Neverwinter would've used it in a spell.~
@40 = ~NP: You shouldnt regret it. Of course, some creatures were somewhat... more sensitive than others... but thats not all. The cure pestilence spell isnt supposed to be lethal, and some of these creatures are said to have come of their own free will, out of mercy. Of course, there are rumors that one of them was imprisoned in Waterdeep, and perhaps the trip was a chance for him to escape. But I dont know anything more about it.~ /*Of course, rumors say one was imprisoned in Waterdeep, and probably saw the trip as a chance to escape. Don't know any more than that, though.*/
@41 = ~Who might you be, then? Speak up, speak up, I can't spend much time on pleasantries right now. Too much to do.~ [HARBEN51]
@42 = ~What manner of malcontent are you? Say who you are and why I should bother with you. I've got a lot to worry about right now.~ [HARBEN52]
@43 = ~Back again, hmm? Need a recap?~ [HARBEN53]
@44 = ~Have you had any updates? Any new information?~
@45 = ~Not as such. We're still up to our armpits in dead things. You find anything out, let me know.~
@46 = ~Tell me about this Snake Cult.~
@47 = ~NP: It seems Drol, the leader of the Sword Coast Boys, has turned into some kind of powerful undead. Killed all his rivals... even some members of his gang. Something called Gulnan is behind it all... Gulnan... How do I know that name... Oh my god. It was written on one of the boxes that came from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures there. In the name of the abyss, what could we bring that would cause such turmoil? I will ask about it when they open Nevers Castle, by all means!~ /*Seems Drawl, the leader of the Sword Coast Boys, has become a powerful undead. Killed his rivals... some of his own gang too. Something named Gulnan was behind it...*/
@48 = ~You'd better check the Sword Coast Boys' warehouse in the Beggar's Nest north central. This Gulnan contacted Drawl somehow, and not by walking the streets openly.~
@49 = ~Now, who might you be, then? I don't have a lot of time to talk. We're busy with clean up now that the zombie threat seems to be over.~ [HARBEN55]
@50 = ~Who are you?~
@51 = ~I found the Waterdhavian Yuan-Ti creature. It raised the zombies.~
@52 = ~I killed the creature that caused the undead.~
@53 = ~NP: I? Oh, Im nobody, really. people here think Im some kind of militia leader, but Im not a guard. My position is unofficial, so to speak. However, I am loved enough here to be able to do business. Its valuable, isnt it? Much more valuable than uniforms and everything else. So whats your business?~ /*Still, they like me well enough that I can get things done. That's valuable, you know? More so than uniforms and whatnot. So, what's on your mind?*/
@54 = ~NP: Yuan-ti? Apparently, the search for a cure had reached a dead end if they decided to risk contact with one of these creatures. I cant tell you what to do with it. I advise you to take this to Aribeth. She wants to see it.~ /*A Yuan-Ti? The search for a cure must not be going well if they are willing to risk dealing with one of those.*/
@55 = ~Am I to be rewarded for my efforts?~
@56 = ~Reward time. Cough something up or I get nasty.~
@57 = ~NP: I want to talk about the reward.~ /*Me want talk about reward.*/
@58 = ~NP: Was it Yuan-ti? Apparently, the search for a cure had reached a dead end if they decided to risk contact with one of these creatures. I cant tell you what to do with it. I advise you to take this to Aribeth. She wants to see it.~ /*A Yuan-Ti? The search for a cure must not be going well if they are willing to risk dealing with one of those.*/
@59 = ~Yes, I know, and I have already given you the reward that you deserved. We cannot afford any more.~
@60 = ~And thank you again. Good luck.~
@61 = ~NP: Goes. I know that Aribeth considers the task itself to be the reward. As for me, I prefer coins. Heres 800 gold for you, and the item Ive saved for the right person. You are a hero... and very sympathetic to me.~ /*Here's 500 gold for you, and an item that I was saving for just the right person. Yer a hero... and likable, too.*/
@62 = ~Come now. Don't I deserve more than that?~
@63 = ~Me tough and scary. You give more!~
@64 = ~Thanks. Farewell.~
@65 = ~NP: No need to be rude. I have gold set aside for the one who helped us. You will receive your share. Heres 800 gold for you, and the item Ive saved for the right person. You are a hero... and very sympathetic to me.~ /*Here's 500 gold for you, and an item that I was saving for just the right person. Yer a hero... and likable, too.*/
@66 = ~I have already given out a reward. I am very grateful for any assistance, but we can afford no more.~
@67 = ~All right, but don't go wearing out your welcome. This is coming out of my own pocket. Beat it.~

@69 = ~I don't think that would be very fair. I've paid what I can and there's not much more.~
@70 = ~NP: Well, you know, I CAN do it, but Drake and I have something against bullies. We dont like them. We lacked people, and you helped us. Youve got your share, and now its time for you to leave.~ /*Well, you know, I WOULD do that, but there's this thing me and Drake have about bullies. We don't appreciate 'em.*/
@71 = ~Thank you. Be safe out there.~
@72 = ~NP: We knew youd help us, I swear by Willikers sideburns. We heard rumors about your exploits, and we knew that you could solve our problem. If you find anything worthwhile in this turmoil, let Aribet know about it. She keeps a record of it, or something like that.~ [HARBEN56] /*I knew you'd help us, by Whilliker's whiskers. I heard about what you did before, and knew you'd take care of business.*/
