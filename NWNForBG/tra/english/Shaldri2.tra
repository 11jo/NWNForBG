@0 = ~I'll be good! Please don't hurt me!~ [SHALD058]
@1 = ~Shaldrissa, right? I'm <CHARNAME> and your father sent me to rescue you.~
@2 = ~NP: Shaldriss, right? Your father sent us to rescue you.~ /*Shaldrissa, right? I'm <CHARNAME> and your father sent me to rescue you.*/
@3 = ~NP: I will save you.~ /*I hear you.*/
@4 = ~NP: Wait here.~ /*Wait right here.*/
@5 = ~NP: Save? (sobbing) Wait, you... you saved Neverwinter. Have the gods taken pity on me? Is it possible, in spite of all my stupidity? I shouldn't have believed him! The whole thing was supposed to be a wonderful adventure, and I am a great heroine... like you. Oh Gods! I will never be able to return home.~ /*I shouldn't have believed him! It was going to be a grand adventure and I would be a true hero... like you. Oh, gods! I'll never be able to return home.*/
@6 = ~Settle down and tell me what's going on here.~
@7 = ~Save the story for your father. You must go now.~
@8 = ~I will. (sob)~
@9 = ~*Sob* I'm sorry. I'm calm now and I'll tell you what happened.~
@10 = ~NP: When you started bringing the ears of the prisoners, a man in a raincoat approached me. He said he knew that I dreamed of adventure. He spoke a little strange, but he was very kind to me. It was all so mysterious and interesting. He gave me some wine and told me that he was an Earl of Waterdeep and had been accused of a crime he did not commit and had escaped from prison.~ /*After you started returning with the ears of the other prisoners, I was approached by a man in a cloak. He said that he knew I was looking for adventure. He talked strangely but he was nice to me.*/
@11 = ~You fell for that old story?~
@12 = ~Do you think you've had enough mystery in your life now?~
@13 = ~(sob) I'm so afraid to face my father. I... I wish I had listened to him in the first place. Thank you for rescuing a foolish child. Goodbye and good luck <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@14 = ~NP: I don't know why I believed him. Maybe it's because of the guilt. I think he just fit my childhood idea of a noble hero. At night we ran away and went to the mines. There were already these terrible orcs waiting for us, and when I began to ask him what was happening, he just laughed and knocked me down. Then he... he... I... I can't talk about it.~ /*I don't know why I believed him. Maybe it was the wine. I guess he just fit my childish image of a noble hero. We snuck away at night and travelled to the mines.*/
@15 = ~NP: I realized who he was. I heard my father talking about him. Ezgar said that he was going to demand a ransom for me, and when there was no money left in the town, he would take me away and sell me into slavery. I shouldn't have gone with him! Dad must have been so worried! (sobbing) I'm sorry... so sorry. (sobs)~ /*I figured out who he was. I had heard my father talk about him. Yesgar told me that he was going to hold me for ransom and once he had bled the town dry, he was going to take me away to sell into slavery.*/
@16 = ~It's all over now. You should be safe to go home.~
@17 = ~Yesgar told me that you were the one who planned this and wanted the money.~
@18 = ~Oh, yes. I want to be back in boring, old Port Llast. I like boring now. I'll never want mystery again.~
@19 = ~What?! I would never do something like that to my father or to Port Llast! I know I had a bad attitude, <CHARNAME>, but they are still my family and friends. I would never wish them ill.~
@20 = ~Hmm. Well, you seem sincere, but it's your father's problem now. You can go home to him.~
@21 = ~I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt! I just want to go home! (sob)~ [SHALD055]
@22 = ~I must be going. My father wishes me to stay in our house for awhile. I can't really say I blame him. Goodbye!~ [SHALD060]
@23 = ~Home! This town means everything to me! Thank you for saving me, <CHARNAME>. I will never do anything so foolish again!~ [SHALD056]
