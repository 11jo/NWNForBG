@0 = ~MT: There are more people in the sewer these days than garbage. Uh-uh... but it's not a sewer. No,<SIRMAAM> ! Aqueducts! Clean and tidy! Please forgive my confusion. I still can't get used to this new city beautification program the city council has started. Her best side seems to be giving everything beautiful new names.~ /*Please pardon my confusion. I'm still getting the hang of this new beautification program the city council put in place. The finer points of it seem to be giving things pretty names.*/
@1 = ~You know: sewers become aqueducts, waste becomes surplus resource, and my cushy job at the castle becomes tour-guide to the FREAKIN' SEWERS! BUT I'M NOT BITTER!~
@2 = ~Has anyone else passed by this point?~
@3 = ~Where do these Aqueducts go?~
@4 = ~Can you take me downstream?~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~MT: Well, I saw several groups of people who went downstream. It seemed a little odd to me, but they didn't bother me. First, a man walked by, sort of by himself. Such an old man, and his dress is rich. I thought he knew where he was going. Then a whole crowd of thugs passed here, it looked like what they had in mind - a bloody affair. However, they were not so sure where to go.~ /*Well now, actually there were a couple groups that I saw heading downstream. I thought it was a bit odd, but they didn't bother me.*/
@7 = ~MT: Well, they're connected to the old sewer down there. There used to be warehouses, but the city has not used them for many, many years. The area has grown, and the passage to these old dungeons has been built up. Few people know the location of the old tunnels. However, sometimes I hear voices down there.~ /*As the districts expanded, access to those old areas got built over. Not a lot of people know the layout of those old tunnels. I hear voices down there on occasion, though.*/
@8 = ~MT: No, I can't leave my post. At any moment, an unforeseen situation may arise and then my qualifications will be needed. THIS COULD HAPPEN! I can send you alone. This is not dangerous. In any case, I think so. Just say the word and you can swim.~ /*Well, I can't leave my post here. An emergency might arise and my special expertise might be needed. IT COULD HAPPEN!*/
@9 = ~MT: Send me downstream.~ /*Send me downstream.*/
@10 = ~You sure you won't stick around? I found some hors d'oeuvres. I think they're little wieners. Uh... okay, bye then.~
@11 = ~Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>, merrily merrily! Here you go.~
@12 = ~You're back again? Some people just can't get enough of the sewers. Aqueducts! I meant Aqueducts! Nothing sewer-ish about it! No <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@13 = ~I guess things will be getting back to normal. Just me and the sewers. Aqueducts! I meant to say Aqueducts! Pure and clean! Yes indeed!~
