@0 = ~Greetings, I am Master Ford, head archeologist of Neverwinter. Lord Nasher mentioned someone might be coming to investigate the Source Stone. <CHARNAME>, isn't it?~ [ARCHEL057]
@1 = ~The Source Stone is truly a remarkable discovery, I must say. Fascinating. I've been an archeologist for nearly half a century and I've never come across anything like it before. I tried to pry some of its secrets from Haedraline - the lizard creature Lord Nasher has imprisoned in the dungeons. But she didn't seem to trust me.~ /*I tried to pry some of its secrets from Haedraline - the lizard creature Lord Nasher has imprisoned in the dungeons. But she didn't seem to trust me.*/
@2 = ~I need to see the Source Stone.~
@3 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Uh... yes. Yes, of course. Why should I be the only one allowed to see it? It isn't mine, after all. Go right in and take a look if you want. I doubt it will do you much good, however. There doesn't seem to be any way to unlock the secrets of the stone. I thought the Words of Power might be the key, but they haven't done anything so far.~
@6 = ~Don't you think it might be dangerous to unlock the secrets of the Source Stone?~
@7 = ~How come nobody noticed this stone down here before?~
@8 = ~Of course, I'm happy to share my knowledge with you. I feel my theories on the secrets of the Source Stone are somewhat wasted on my students. Esmerelda thinks we shouldn't be tampering with the Source Stone. And Cletus is as ignorant as he is arrogant. I gave him some old texts to read to keep him out of my hair.~ /*Esmerelda thinks we shouldn't be tampering with the Source Stone. And Cletus is as ignorant as he is arrogant. I gave him some old texts to read to keep him out of my hair.*/
@9 = ~Who are you again?~
@10 = ~What do you know about the Source Stone?~
@11 = ~Where are the Words of Power?~
@12 = ~Feel free to speak to me again anytime, <CHARNAME>. I'm always eager to discuss the Source Stone.~ 
@13 = ~You sound like my assistant Esmerelda. She wants nothing to do with the stone. But I am well aware of the risks involved. And yet... I cannot leave the stone alone. When awake it consumes my thoughts and at night it haunts my dreams. It calls to me... it *wants* me to unravel the mysteries contained within!~
@14 = ~You feel the call of the ancient evil that dwells within the stone, Master Ford. Beware lest it consume you.~ 
@15 = ~It was only after that lizard creature Haedraline told us of the Source Stone's existence that we began to search beneath the dungeons of Castle Never for hidden passages. We found the secret door easily enough, then. It was almost too easy, considering nobody ever noticed it before. It's almost like the Source Stone itself *wants* to be found now.~ 
@16 = ~I am Master Ford, Neverwinter's foremost expert in ancient artifacts and historical treasures. In short, an archeologist. When the Source Stone was discovered here beneath Castle Never, Lord Nasher wisely appointed me to investigate its secrets. What I have uncovered so far has been fascinating!~ 
@17 = ~The stone radiates a magical heat strong enough to keep the entire city warm even in this chill climate, yet gentle enough that you can actually go right up and touch the stone itself. That is all we really know for certain. However, I have several theories based on my own examinations and extensive research into ancient manuscripts.~ 
@18 = ~Tell me your theories.~
@19 = ~I'm not interested in your theories.~
@20 = ~They're with the Source Stone. I thought they might be the key to unlocking it's secrets, but they didn't work. Perhaps something is missing. The Source Stone is surrounded by four pedestals. I placed a Word of Power on each pedestal, but of course there were only three Words.~ 
@21 = ~My research indicates that there is an entire extra-planar realm within its gleaming crystalline surface; a nexus of many parallel worlds, a conduit linking alternate planes and universes with each other. And something lives within the Source Stone as well. Of that I'm certain. A powerful life force emanates from the stone - probably from the inhabitants of the extra-planar realm.~ 
@22 = ~Ah, well. Perhaps some other time, then. Is there something else you need?~
@23 = ~I suspect there is a fourth Word that is necessary to unlock the Source Stone. Four pedestals, four Words of Power. Just a theory, of course, but a fairly logical conclusion.~
@24 = ~That lizard creature Haedraline could probably tell you more, if she wanted to. But when I tried to speak to her she refused to answer my questions. I don't think she trusts me.~
@25 = ~Back again, <CHARNAME>? Is there something I can do for you?~ [ARCHEL056]
