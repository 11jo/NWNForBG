@0 = ~With Kurth dead, we'll... well, we don't know what. Got an army now with nobody to lead it.~
@1 = ~Ye're one o' Kurth's, aye? Aye, I think ye are. Good. If Kurth's going to be the true High Captain, he needs all the recruits he can get.~
@2 = ~What're you? One o' Baram's, I expect? Kurth will kill you all, I bet.~
@3 = ~We've driven Baram an' his men down to the sewers. They should stay there, if they're smart.~
@4 = ~Word in the Bloody Hands is that even though Kurth is dead, we ain't disbanding. Someone else is gonna lead us... don't know who, though.~
@5 = ~Those curs of Baram's are going to pay for burnin' down our tower, they will!~
@6 = ~Stand off, ye bloody cur.~
@7 = ~I gotta go back to West Harbor soon. Maybe I'll take the short-cut in that hole in the wall by the old tower.~
@8 = ~Kurth's dead! I wonder who had the guts to do that...~
@9 = ~Heh. Look at Baram's men cowering over there. Kurth'll have mopped the floor with them in no time.~
@10 = ~Go on, get out of here. You're not one of Kurth's, which means ye're less than spit to me.~
@11 = ~Baram's men shouldn't even be allowed in here...~
@12 = ~I'm gonna find the fool who killed Kurth and make them pay, I will! Right after that fool o' Baram's over there...~
@13 = ~There's been hordes of them... creatures in the streets. I thinks Baram's in league with necromancers, summonin' ghouls an' such.~
@14 = ~I'd smash yer face in... but we ain't allowed, in here.~
@15 = ~Huh. Who are you supposed to be?~
