@0 = ~Spare a coin, friend?~ [NWFEST50]
@1 = ~Here's a couple gold for you.~
@2 = ~I cannot afford to give you anything. I am sorry.~
@3 = ~I don't give out charity.~
@4 = ~Ah, you are generous. Someone that knows the value of a coin to a stranger. A stranger that might know something. I'm not really interested in coin, but I'm interested in you. What do you need here? This isn't a friendly place.~ 
@5 = ~I am here to keep order. I can say no more.~
@6 = ~Do you know how to enter the Seedy Tavern?~
@7 = ~Why is this district so dangerous?~
@8 = ~None of your business, fool.~
@9 = ~Ah, I don't know if you can afford it or not, but your rebuff was polite. You treat knowledgeable strangers well. I'm not really interested in coin, but I'm interested in you. What do you need here? This isn't a friendly place.~ 
@10 = ~Ah, you waste nothing on those that don't serve, but how can you know my worth, hmm? Perhaps I know things... I'm not really interested in coin, but I'm interested in you. What do you need here? This isn't a friendly place.~ 
@11 = ~Ah, but how will you keep that order? Will you kill, or bully... or cure? Yes, you would want a cure...~
@12 = ~Ah, you need the cure, and the auction is what you seek. The streets are mine from the underside. I know things...~
@13 = ~Dangerous? No longer. The pirates are gone, and the prize, the cockatrice, is back where it needs to be. There is little to do here now. the Docks are quiet.~
@14 = ~But my business is the streets. I keep low to them, and hear much. A pity you do not value this. Very well, I say nothing and do nothing. But...~ 
@15 = ~It is gone from here. The pirates are defeated and the prize, the cockatrice, is back in the proper hands. The Docks are done and quiet.~
@16 = ~Have you the currency of thieves? Or the garb of a guild? Old Seedy's tavern will not open without. But what do I know of these things? Merchants quiver with currency, and pirates keep their uniforms as close as their ships. I am but a beggar among kings... and in the service of both. Good day to you.~
@17 = ~A show, a challenge, but the players are in revolt. You willl want to attend. The market holds what you seek.~
@18 = ~There is no need. The pirates have been put down, the prize, the cockatrice, returned to where it needs to be. There is little in the Docks for you. It's a quiet place now.~
@19 = ~I was treated rudely, so I will say little. Bridges have been burned with me. To walk amongst pirates you must look the part. How to do that? Well, you are big and strong. Go ask them.~
@20 = ~Back again to Festiliard? I am popular tonight. Do you seek knowledge from the beggar about the path ahead?~ [NWFEST51]
