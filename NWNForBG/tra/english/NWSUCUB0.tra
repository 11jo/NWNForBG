@0 = ~A visitor? This is unexpected. Please, do not let the old tales of demons dissuade you from... talking. There is much help I can give you.~
@1 = ~Who are you? What are you doing here?~
@2 = ~How can you help me?~
@3 = ~Sorry. I'm not talking to a demon. Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Revealing my true name to a mortal is how I was bound into the service of the mage Layenne and stripped of my power; I will not make that mistake again. All you need know is that even after her death I am still bound to Layenne's service, trapped in this tomb, unable to retreat and too weak to break free of my magical bonds.~ 
@5 = ~Why, I can give you so many things. And I can do things for you, too. I can... help you. But you will need to help me, too. You will need to bring me... things. Things that I need to restore my lost power so that I can... help you.~ 
@6 = ~Do I need to sell my soul or something?~
@7 = ~What do you want from me?~
@8 = ~Tell me more about how you can help me.~
@9 = ~I'd rather not have you help me. Goodbye.~
@10 = ~The choice is yours mortal, though you know not what you refuse. Should you decide to accept my offer I shall be here, waiting to... help you.~
@11 = ~But if you would let me help you, and you would help me in return, I could escape this bondage and return to my home plane. Let me... help you.~
@12 = ~I have no interest in your soul, mortal. My only desire is to escape the spell that binds me to this tomb. For this I need your help... and I offer my own help to you in return.~
@13 = ~Scattered about this tomb are... talismans... of my power. A ring, a necklace and a gem were taken from me when Layenne bound me to her service. With these talismans back in my possession my lost power will be restored and I can escape this prison. For each piece of my jewelry you bring me, mortal, I will... help you.~ 
@14 = ~I have one of your talismans here.~
@15 = ~Fine, I will do this.~
@16 = ~So without those talismans you're trapped here?~
@17 = ~I will not do this for you!~
@18 = ~I am a succubus, a demon. I have power, mortal. Do you want magic? I have great magic to give you. Or I can perform a service for you. There are doors within this temple, doors that cannot be easily opened. I will open them, if you wish. If you help me, mortal, your reward will be great. This I promise you.~ 
@19 = ~Then you must give it to me, so that I might regain some of my lost power so that I might... help you. Please, give me what is rightfully mine.~
@20 = ~Take the ring. Now, how will you help me?~ 
@21 = ~Take the necklace. Now, how will you help me?~ 
@22 = ~Take the gem. Now, how will you help me?~ 
@23 = ~Thank you, mortal. I will be waiting here for you to return with the talismans so that I might free myself... and help you.~
@24 = ~Layenne imprisoned me so that I might serve her, as mages are wont to do to my kind. Even her death long ago did not free me from this prison. But if you were to bring me my jewelry, the talismans of my power, I could escape this servitude. In return, I could use my power to... help you.~ 
@25 = ~How do I know I can trust you?~
@26 = ~My promise to serve you binds me even as I am bound to this tomb. This single talisman cannot free me, but it gives me enough power to serve you. Tell me, mortal, what would you have me do? I can make you stronger. Or I can give you powerful magic of the kind you mortals so desire.~
@27 = ~I want to become stronger.~
@28 = ~Give me a powerful magical item.~
@29 = ~I don't want you to do anything for me.~
@30 = ~My power is fully restored! I am free from this wretched prison and the oaths that bind me! Now, foolish mortal, your soul is mine to devour!~
@31 = ~I am bound to honor my word, just as I am bound to this prison. I have promised to help you and so I must do as I have sworn. Bring me my talismans and I will... help you. This is my solemn vow.~ 
@32 = ~So shall it be done. Take this book. My power is not yet fully restored. I am still bound to this place. Bring me the rest of my missing talismans so that I may be free and I shall grant you an even greater reward.~ 
@33 = ~Yes, you wish for great power. I will summon forth an item from my plane to... help you. Take this item, mortal. My power is not yet fully restored. I am still bound to this place. Bring me the rest of my missing talismans so that I may be free and I shall grant you an even greater reward.~ 
@34 = ~Are you certain? I am bound to your service, mortal. I merely wish to... help you. The choice is yours mortal, though you know not what you refuse. Should you decide to accept my offer I shall be here, waiting to... help you.~ 
@35 = ~I don't know you, but I heard that you work with <CHARNAME>, right? You're that <RACE> who's working for Aarin Gend, aren't you?~
@36 = ~Greetings once more, mortal. Have you brought me my missing jewelry? I need the precious talismans if I am to use their power to help you.~
@37 = ~No, I won't give you the talisman you want.~
@38 = ~But without the talisman, I haven't the strength to... help you. Do not forsake me to this prison. If you help me, mortal, then I can help you. Please, I beg you for the talisman.~
