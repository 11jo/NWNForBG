@0 = ~You are welcome in this house of Tyr, <BROTHERSISTER>... or what remains of it. I am afraid many of my brethren have either been killed or have abandoned us.~
@1 = ~I am in need of healing.~
@2 = ~NP: Do you have any healing supplies for sale?~ /*Do you have any healing or clerical supplies that you could sell?*/
@3 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~You have survived some battle in our streets, have you? Then you have earned Tyr's blessing. It is the least that I can do to aid you.~
@6 = ~When the temple was attacked, much of our supplies were taken. The acolytes who remain have helped me gather some tinctures and potions and such... come, I will show you.~
@7 = ~I will answer you what I can. What do you wish to know?~
@8 = ~What has happened here?~
@9 = ~Tell me about what's going on in Luskan.~
@10 = ~Farewell Tyr grant you justice.~ /*Tyr grant you justice.*/
@11 = ~There is not much of a temple left, though once this was once a fine temple to the Just God in the north. Nowhere was a champion of justice needed more. When the High Captains began their war against one another, each expected the warrior priests of our temple to aid them. We sought to help all and not ally ourselves only to one... and therefore met only suspicion. We were attacked several times, but only recently did the temple fall. I was away from the temple, but upon my return I was told that sorcerers and soldiers had suddenly appeared and slain most of my brethren and looted the temple.~ /*We were attacked several times, but only recently did the temple fall.

@12 = ~That is a very large question, friend. What is it about the city that puzzles you?~
@13 = ~What is all the fighting about?~
@14 = ~Do you know of any cults active in the city?~
@15 = ~Is there no one who can stop all the fighting?~
@16 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@17 = ~What few survived the battle had been taken prisoner. I know naught what has been done with them. Perhaps they have been pressed into service as the High Captains wished. I can only pick up what pieces remain with the few acolytes I have left and push on. Fortunately your Lord Nasher has been very kind in his donations... housing Aarin Gend and you others is the least we can do.~ /*I can only pick up what pieces remain with the few acolytes I have left and push on.

@18 = ~Nobody is sure. There were five High Captains who ruled the city... at the bidding of the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, perhaps, but all five of the pirate lords held power. Several weeks ago, without warning, the High Captains began a war to eradicate each other. Our temple is not the only casualty in the strife that ensued.~ /*Nobody is sure. There were five High Captains who ruled the city... at the bidding of the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, perhaps, but all five of the pirate lords held power.*/
@19 = ~Hmmm... cults, do you say? I was told of any one of a number of small sects that were active in Luskan. None of any true importance. My master did express concern, once, that several of the High Captains were associating overmuch with a cult dedicated to the evil goddess Auril... but I know little more of it.~ /*My master did express concern, once, that several of the High Captains were associating overmuch with a cult dedicated to the evil goddess Auril... but I know little more of it.*/
@20 = ~Nobody except for an invasion by the Lords' Alliance... or the Arcane Brotherhood's intervention, perhaps. For whatever reason, they remain unmoved by all the violence.~
@21 = ~Why do you think that is?~
@22 = ~Who can say? The Brotherhood have always kept to themelves in the Host Tower. No-one but the High Captains themselves ever sees them.~
@23 = ~Welcome, <BROTHERSISTER>. You are welcome in the house of the Maimed God. Few of us remain here due to recent hardships... I only ask that you do not add to them.~
@24 = ~The Maimed God bids welcome to a proud defender of good, my <LADYLORD>. Would that our temple were in a condition to give you proper hospitality... few of my brethren remain here, now.~
@25 = ~Greetings. This is the house of Tyr, the Blind Overlord... or perhaps I should say it was. We have been robbed of much and most of my own brethren no longer remain here.~
