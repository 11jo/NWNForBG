If you'd like, I'll look at your equipment and duffel bag, see if there's anything suitable for me to make you a really dangerous weapon or powerful armor.

@72 = ~Always a pleasure doing business with a fine <PRO_MANWOMAN> such as yourself. Stand back - you don't want to catch a hammer in the head.~
@73 = ~MT: Fair enough - but I don't do charity work. No money - no item.~ /*Fair enough - but this isn't a charity I'm running. If you don't have the gold, you don't get the item. Anything else I can do for you?*/
