@0 = ~Why my children, huh? Why couldn't the Wailing have taken someone like you, instead?~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I can spare a few moments. Perhaps the idle chatter will clear my thoughts.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Would you buy a cure if it was offered?~
@8 = ~Thanks for the distraction from my troubles - I hope your kin don't fall prey the same as mine...~
@9 = ~Neverwinter... This city was a good place once. Now it's nothing but burning bodies piled in the streets. I don't even have a family anymore.~
@10 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@11 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@12 = ~MT: There is another question.~ /*I want to ask something else.*/
@13 = ~I know I don't want to get it. The Wailing took my entire family, one after the other. I watched 'em die, every one - They shriveled up from the inside.~
@14 = ~Do you mean physically or spiritually?~
@15 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@16 = ~MT: Like I care about anything! I'm afraid to go home and look at these corpses. I am also afraid that I myself can catch this disease. If you want to find out some details, I will not interfere. I'll stay here: on the street and out of trouble.~ /*As if I care about anything else right now. I'm scared to go home, to see the bodies. I'm scared maybe I'll catch it too.*/
@17 = ~A... a cure? There were rumors that one was in the works, but nobody believed us common folk would get it any time soon. W-why do you ask if I would pay for it?~
@18 = ~I have the cure! Give me all your gold and you can have it!~
@19 = ~To find out if you have gold! Hand it over, now!~
@20 = ~Nevermind. I just have a few other questions.~
@21 = ~Don't you go starting that kind of crap with me. I've already been took for everything I've got. Ask your questions and get lost!~
@22 = ~MT: The heart of the city is like an eye, and you and I are right in its pupil. There are other areas around... And through all this flows a river full of tears. Can I tell you about the Beggar's Nest? About the port area? Black lake? Peninsula? The heart of the city? Take your pick, I have my whole life ahead of me. Not long, really.~ /*Do you want to hear about the Beggar's Nest? The Docks? The Blacklake? The Peninsula? The City Core? Take your pick - I have a lifetime, however short.*/
@23 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@24 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@25 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@26 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@27 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula.~
@28 = ~That would depend on what you are looking for. I suppose I could make my best guess at what you want.~
@29 = ~MT: What's the difference? First, the eyes go blind, and then the whole body becomes paralyzed... This is how the Howling Death begins... Maybe these helmites are right. Maybe it's a mental illness. Maybe the gods are angry with us... I wonder how I managed to survive?~ /*Maybe those Helmites are right. Maybe it's a wasting of the soul. Maybe the gods are mad at us... My question is how come I survived?*/
@30 = ~MT: Heh, to us &quot;simpletons&quot;, you don't have to say that. They think we'll panic if there's no hope left, or raid if there's a cure. I haven't heard anything and probably won't. I don't know if this is a blessing or a curse, but as long as I'm alive...~ /*Bah, won't tell us "simple people." They think we'd panic if there was no hope or stampede if a cure was announced.*/
@31 = ~W-what? You... you would rob me in the street in full view of anyone walking by? Are you insane? What about guards? What about watchmen?~
@32 = ~I'm a guard and you are nobody. Hand over your gold or die like a dog!~
@33 = ~Ahh, I was just joking around. Sorry about that.~
@34 = ~MT: We are here now. All necessary services are provided here. Many people live here... But there are fewer of them every day... Nevers Castle is located in the west, where all our &quot;enlightened elite&quot; do business. I myself buy everything I need abroad. Of course, because of the Howling Death, there's not much to get now...~ /*That's where we is now. Got all your basic services as such. Lots of different kinds of people make their home here... Less every day, mind you...*/
@35 = ~Beggar's Nest? Don't let anyone sour you on that place - Good honest poor people live and die there. Not like Blacklake or the Docks.~
@36 = ~MT: To me, it's no coincidence that the plague started in the Beggars' Nest! The rich needed an excuse to destroy him. And now these zombies or whatever... Even if my relatives weren't among them, I don't want them to become like that.~ /*Now there's even some zombies or something... I hope none of them are my family - I wouldn't want them to have to be like that.*/
@37 = ~MT: Yes, and things are getting better. The plague is still rampant, but someone destroyed all the zombies or whatever was the source of these problems. I hope there were no members of my family among these zombies. And if they were, I would be grateful to anyone who finally allowed them to find peace ...~ /*I hope none of them zombies were my family - Though if they were, I'd like to thank whoever did the clearing for giving them their due rest...*/
@38 = ~I used to do the occasional odd job in Docks district, but not any more. Didn't like working for pirates.~
@39 = ~MT: Last I heard, this place is full of thieves. For some reason, these people really need money. Stay away from the docks. Having lost your family, you should not lose your wallet either. And the guards will not help, if anything.~ /*Stay clear of the Docks. Losing your family is worry enough without losing your purse, too. The guards are no help neither.*/
@40 = ~MT: They say things are getting better. There was some fight, or something like that, but now it's over. And there are fewer bullies. Maybe you have heard about it, or maybe you yourself participated? I don't know, but the area is quieter now... Except for this Howling Plague.~ /*Maybe you heard about that, or maybe you had a part in it? I dunno, but the area seems much more calm... aside from the Wailing, of course.*/
@41 = ~Bah! Bunch of stuck up nobles. The Wailing has them tied in knots - Kills them just the same as any commoner, and that fact drives 'em nuts.~
@42 = ~Apparently they're even seizing resources meant for us poorer folk. My brother wouldn't have passed away so easy if he only had a little food in him.~
@43 = ~What do you know about that?~
@44 = ~MT: It was even said that they tried to hide provisions and part of the medicine! But someone interrupted them. Maybe it was you? Well, I'm glad they got theirs. They deserved it, and here it became calmer.~ /*Maybe that was you? Well, I'm glad they got shook up. They deserved it and it quieted things down out there, too.*/
@45 = ~MT: It doesn't concern me, so I'm safe. I don't know much. You see, the aristocrats from the Black Lake and someone else, I don't know who, are stockpiling provisions. This way they made a lot of enemies. I heard that there were some riots because of them. I don't know how it ended there. It's none of my business. I was the last of the family left, I have something to fill my head with.~ /*Last I heard there was rioting because of them. Don't know how it turned out. Not my business. Being the last left of my family, I've got other worries.*/
@46 = ~It's not for me to say. I'm not involved and I don't know much, anyway. Being the last left of my family, I've got other worries.~
@47 = ~MT: You really don't know the city if you ask. Nobody goes to the peninsula. There is a prison there. The prison is usually very strict, but I have no idea what the plague has done to her now. I was told - but I won't say who - that several prisoners and guards were killed. I wonder what's going on there...~ /*I even heard -but I ain't saying from who- that some prisoners and guards have been killed. Wonder what's going on in there...*/
@48 = ~MT: You really don't know the city if you ask. Nobody goes to the peninsula. Now things have calmed down a bit. I heard that there were casualties, and even the chief there died. It's none of my business, but I'm glad the situation has been brought under control. And did you get to participate in it? Well, you are great!~ /*Not my business, but I'm glad they sorted it out. You have something to do with that? Good on you if you did.*/
@49 = ~MT: Are you doing something illegal? Don't be afraid, I'm dumb like a fish! But I can tell you something interesting... Near the main exit from the city - it's in the Heart of the city, in the southeast, there is a place - Moonstone Mask. There are a lot of interesting things. And if you need a simpleton who will turn his throat for you - go straight to the Sword Fair, this is a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.*/
@50 = ~MT: Are you one of those nature lovers, forest vagrants, right? Perhaps you should visit the Druid Tree, it is in the southwest of the district, next to the gate. And if you need a simpleton who will turn his throat for you - go straight to the Sword Fair, this is a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*You one of them nature-talking forest-walkers, aren't you? I suppose you might visit the Druid Tree in the City Core upper square east.*/
@51 = ~MT: Are you looking for a temple or something? Then you need to go to the temple of Tyr, it is in the western part of the Heart of the city, north of the main square. And if you need a simpleton who will turn his throat for you - go straight to the Sword Fair, this is a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.*/
@52 = ~MT: Are you by any chance a spellcaster? The Cloak Tower is the right place for you, it is in the east of the district .. And if you need a dupe who will turn your throat for you - go straight to the Sword Fair, this is a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.*/
@53 = ~MT: Are you looking for good steel or something like that? It's all in Shining Knight Arms and Armor, in the Heart of the City, just south of the main square. And if you need a simpleton who will turn his throat for you - go straight to the Sword Fair, this is a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.*/
@54 = ~MT: You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to &quot;Shining Weapons and Armor for Knights&quot;, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Well, thieves are welcome in the Mask of the Moonstone. And if you need a simpleton who will turn his throat for you - go straight to the Sword Fair, this is a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.*/
@55 = ~But... no, please! I... I just want to get through all of this alive! Here... take it! Take all the gold I have! Take it and... and get out of my sight... just go...~
@56 = ~I... I don't understand what you are talking about. Ask your questions and leave me be.~
@57 = ~MT: A cure for the Howling Death? Do you really have a cure?! Gods! I... I need it! Please... please, I'll give you all my gold... It's all I have... and... you're smiling... Why are you... You don't have any medicine... It's a lie.. .~ /*A cure for the Wailing? You actually have a cure?! Gods! I... I have to have it! Please... please, I'll give you all the gold that I have...*/
@58 = ~HAHAHA! What an idiot!~
@59 = ~Don't take it too hard. It's just business.~
@60 = ~You evil piece of garbage... you took all I had left. Get out of my sight... get out!!~
@61 = ~Leave my sight you evil creature. Leave my sight and never return!~
@62 = ~MT: What you need? I have my own worries, you know, enough ...~ /*What is it you need, then? I have worries of my own, you know...*/
