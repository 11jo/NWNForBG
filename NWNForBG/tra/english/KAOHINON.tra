@0 = ~NP: Kaoquinon from the Abyss welcomes you. No need to be afraid of me, I do no harm to anyone, only good. You are not the one who called me. Maybe... Maybe you can complete the ritual they didn't finish?~ /*You are not those who summoned me. Perhaps... perhaps you would finish the ritual that they have let lapse?*/
@1 = ~What ritual you mean, beasty?~
@2 = ~Speak, but no tricks!~
@3 = ~I will not speak with such as you, demon.~
@4 = ~A simple matter, well within your capability. You are far superior to those who brought me here.~
@5 = ~Well, you are a bright one, but it is well within your capability. You are better than those who summoned me.~
@6 = ~As you will. I have patience. Someone will listen. I am but a minor evil.~
@7 = ~NP: You see, they let their petty quarrels get in the way of much more important things. They never completed the calling procedure. I needed to crush the guardian spirit of this place, and I succeeded. For this I was promised freedom. If you're interested, there's a book on the ritual in the office to the south. Black Tome. Complete the ceremony and I will be free.~ /*If you are willing, there is a book of ritual in the study to the south. A Black Grimoire. Complete the ceremony and I shall be free.*/
@8 = ~I will think about it.~
@9 = ~If I did this, you would be in my debt.~
@10 = ~So you can add to the havoc? Never!~
@11 = ~If you must, but actions lead to glory far more often than mere thoughts.~
@12 = ~It stands there, flaunting its evil, with all the time in the world. Chaohinon of the Void is the name of it. Apparently the False Helmites summoned it to crush the Guardian Spirit that watches over Helm's Hold. The demon has done just that, but has not been set free, and now wants someone to find a Black Grimoire and finish the ritual to set it loose upon the world. It promises adequate reward, but they always do, don't they?~
@13 = ~I see you are familiar with these sorts of transactions. Free me and I will reward you well. Do it.~
@14 = ~I languish here. Am I not pathetic? Will you not help me free myself of these bonds? Complete the ritual...~
@15 = ~Me not deal with demons!~
@16 = ~Free... FREE!!! HAHAHAHHAAAA!!!! Now... what to do on my first day out... hmm....~
@17 = ~Me promised reward?~
@18 = ~Now you die, evil beastie!~
@19 = ~WHAAAAHAHHAHAAAA!! Now that IS funny. You are not worth my time! Goodbye, fool!!~
@20 = ~NP: Deal with the Devil Kaoquinon from the Abyss was released into the world to bring evil and destruction. This step will undoubtedly entail certain consequences.~ /*If you need curative scrolls or potions of different sorts, they are the steel of the finest priests...*/
@21 = ~NP: Hmm? Oh yes, my... little... friend. Let me ask you what you want from me. Something... appropriate. Yeaaaaaa... Shall I tease you? A magical cloak, an enchanted double axe, or a taste of power for a VERY short time?~ /*Hmm? Ah yes, my... little... friend. Let me ask what you wish of me. Something... appropriate. Yessssss...*/
@22 = ~NP: I need a magical cloak.~ /*I want the magic item.*/
@23 = ~NP: I'll take the enchanted axe.~ /*I will take the gold.*/
@24 = ~Grant me some of your power.~
@25 = ~NP: I don't need your help!~ /*I need a little help over here.*/
@26 = ~NP: Hmm? Oh yes, my... little... friend. Let me ask you what you want from me. Something... suitable. Yeaaaaaa... Anything for a black heart? Yes, we are similar in some ways. I'll suggest something... more. Name your price. A weapon, a magical item, part of my power for a VERY short time, or... my intuition?~ /*Hmm? Ah yes, my... little... friend. Let me ask what you wish of me. Something... appropriate. Yessssss...*/
@27 = ~I want the magic item.~
@28 = ~I will take the weapon.~
@29 = ~Grant me your insight.~
@30 = ~NP: Hmm? Oh yes, my... little... friend. Let me ask you what you want from me. Something... appropriate. Yeaaaaaa... I feel that you are trying to avoid extremes. Fi! Capricious creatures are not liked, unlike those with firm intentions. Maybe I should tease you? A magical cloak, an enchanted double axe, or a taste of power for a VERY short time?~ /*I sense that you distance yourself from extremes. Bah! Creatures of whimsy are no more welcome than those of pure intent.*/
@31 = ~NP: There will be nothing more. Use my gifts well, mortal. People like me are rarely generous. My obligations have been fulfilled. Nothing binds me to this place anymore. And you go for new challenges.~ /*My obligations are done. I am free of what tied me to this place. I leave you to your trials ahead.*/
@32 = ~NP: You have changed your mind? Great, don't take the reward, but I'm already free!!! Such deals are not so easy to terminate. Nothing binds me to this place anymore. And you go for new challenges.~ /*Changed your mind? Fine, accept no reward, but I am already free!! Deals such as this are difficult to rescind.*/
@33 = ~Ah, you seek knowledge from the infernal. I like that. I shall answer, and you may do what you will with the answers.~
@34 = ~Where is my enemy?~
@35 = ~What caused the plague?~
@36 = ~Who does Desther protect?~
@37 = ~I want ultimate power. How do I get it?~
@38 = ~NP: You are looking for Dester. It seems that he did not create the epidemic that struck Neverwinter, although he spread it and prevented the manufacture of a cure. He's in a cult, but they're just machines to serve your true enemy. The power behind them is... strange. Dester is here, easy to find. But his owner... I don't know. Power clouds my vision... It's so... strange.~ /*You seek Desther. You must suspect he did not create the Neverwinter plague, though he spread it and delayed the cure.*/
@39 = ~Maybe you answer more questions?~
@40 = ~NP: Envy. Anger. People go where they shouldn't. Everything as usual. The only thing that stands out is the CONSEQUENCES of the plague. Those who died from the plague cannot be resurrected, their souls have left their bodies. The healers could do nothing to help, because the body rots STARTING from the soul. This foundation of all things has not disappeared. Someone or something gained what the victims lost. The plague fed its master.~ /*Plague-dead could not be raised, their essense falling away. Healers could not help because the body rotted AROUND the soul.*/
@41 = ~NP: He is no longer needed by his master, whoever he may be. The plague has done its work. Your medicine is ready and in his hands. Now he does not want to submit to fate, and can succeed. The power he's linked to is... unpredictable, even to me.~ /*Himself. He is no longer useful to whomever was his master. The plague has run its course. Your cure is done and in his hand.*/
@42 = ~NP: Oh what ambition! Where I come from is full of people like you. We love to make you dance. So, you need ultimate power, right? Well, I guess you won't have to do much to get it. First of all, you need to get rid of the threat of Neverwinter. Otherwise, you will die, and this is not a good start, agree.~ /*First, you would have to destroy the threat to Neverwinter. You'll be dead, otherwise, and that wouldn't be a good start.*/
@43 = ~NP: No. I am not your personal source of knowledge, and I do not wish to do more for you than I have already done. But still, I like your scent. You have received what was offered to you, but let me give you something else.~ /*I do, however, like the taint of you. You have what I offered, but allow me to gift you with something more.*/
@44 = ~Where it truly came from is beyond my knowledge, a fact that disturbs me and should scare the hells out of you.~
@45 = ~NP: After that, kill the gods with your hatred, enslave hell with sheer willpower, and lead your legions of chaos to the very center of the universe. Of course, if you are unable to pick out details, you won't know what to do with the highest power even when you get it.~ /*After that, maybe slay the gods with your hatred, enslave the hells by will alone, and march your legions of chaos to the very heart of the universe.*/
