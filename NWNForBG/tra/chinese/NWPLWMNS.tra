@0 = ~My husband is going to sea right now. Please come back tomorrow morning, I'll have fresh fish.~
@1 = ~Want to buy fish? I always have the freshest fish on sale. Check out this bass right here, isn't it huge?~
@2 = ~I supply fish to the tavern here, I can sell to you too. Would you like to buy?~
@3 = ~Damn cats! They come to me from all over Port Llast at the smell of fish. They're always trying to steal my fish.~
@4 = ~These kids need an eye on them, always in trouble one way or the other. If I find my son in a fishing basket again, I'll smack him with a raw fish.~
@5 = ~Lately, my husband's catch has been a mess. It has become difficult for a poor fishmonger to make a living, that's the way things are.~
@6 = ~I'll tell in confidence... my man says he's been fishing all day long... but may I die on the spot, if he not in the Alliance Arms Inn all the time.~
@7 = ~Well, get outta here if you ain't buying anything. People will think you're buying up the whole lot from the way you're standing there. FISH! FREEEEESH FIIIIISH!~
