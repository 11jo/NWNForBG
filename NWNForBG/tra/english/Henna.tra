@0 = ~Hello there. My name is Henna. May I guide you along nature's path today?~
@1 = ~What do you mean?~
@2 = ~MT: Конечно. Могу я задать тебе несколько вопросов?~ /*"Can I ask you some questions?"*/
@3 = ~Only if it leads to a city. I can't stand nature.~
@4 = ~Nature has paths that we walk everyday. Some paths are more dangerous than others. Guiding you to the right path is my duty in life, just as others have guided me.~
@5 = ~All right then, guide me by answering some questions.~
@6 = ~What kind of people have guided you in the past?~
@7 = ~I don't see why that would be a duty.~
@8 = ~What questions would you like answered?~
@9 = ~What's going on here?~
@10 = ~What do you do around here?~
@11 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@12 = ~MT: Мне все ясно. До свидания.~ /*That is all. Goodbye.*/
@13 = ~MT: Тогда твой путь очень печален и пуст. На какие вопросы ты хочешь получить ответ?~ /*What questions would you like answered?*/
@14 = ~There have been many, including Aawill, the Archdruid and Jaer, Aawill's second-in-command. There have been... others, as well. But that is really none of your concern.~
@15 = ~Why are you suddenly so uptight? I was just trying to be polite.~
@16 = ~Fine. Maybe you could answer some other questions.~
@17 = ~Is that what you meant by guiding me down the right path? Telling me to mind my own business?~
@18 = ~Whatever. Goodbye.~
@19 = ~When other people help you out, it becomes your duty to help others. At least that is what others have taught me, and I believe it.~
@20 = ~MT: Больше всего нас сейчас беспокоит беда, случившаяся с Духом Леса. В эти дни любой, кто проходит через лес или рядом, подвергается опасности. И никто в точности не понимает, что происходит. Я думаю, архидруид Аавилл знает об этом больше. До меня доходят лишь слухи. Если тебе нужны факты, поговори с Аавиллом.~ /*The biggest problem we face right now is the trouble with the Spirit of the Wood. Anyone travelling near or through the woods is in danger right now. No one is exactly sure what is going on.*/
@21 = ~What kind of rumors?~
@22 = ~I am the defender for the third circle of the grove. I also act as a counselor for troubled minds.~
@23 = ~What sort of counselor?~
@24 = ~What do you mean defender?~
@25 = ~Let me ask you another question.~
@26 = ~MT: Если ты имеешь в виду общее руководство, тогда это архидруид Аавилл. Однако, те, кто собирается пройти испытания на место в круге друидов, должны говорить с Джаэр. Что-нибудь еще?~ /*That depends on what you want. If you mean overall, then Aawill the Archdruid is in charge. If you refer to the challenges for entrance into the druid circle, however, then you should speak to Jaer. Anything else?*/
@27 = ~Be careful. There is always danger and the potential for tragedy on the paths you walk.~
@28 = ~I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped like that. You just touched on a sore topic. I just don't like people prying into my past.~
@29 = ~I understand, but sometimes it helps to share your pain.~
@30 = ~That's okay. Why don't you just answer a different question?~
@31 = ~Missing druids, evil spirits, angry gods - you name it, people have speculated about it. None of it is worth repeating. You should talk to Aawill.~
@32 = ~Just as I needed guidance in the past, so too do others. I try to assist them when they have difficulties.~
@33 = ~MT: Друид из нашей рощи может вызвать меня, но лишь если он входит в четвертый круг и имеет достаточно опыта. Поединками руководит Джаэр, но вы вряд ли сможете вызвать кого-то из наших друидов на поединок, вы здесь чужаки. Я могу тебе еще чем-нибудь помочь?~ /*A druid may challenge me, but only if they are a member of the fourth circle and have sufficient experience. You should speak to Jaer if you have further questions about the challenges. Is there anything else I can help you with?*/
@34 = ~Maybe you're right. You seem trustworthy. I was the spoiled child of a noble family. When I turned twelve I decided that my parents' rules were too strict, so I ran away from home. I knew nothing of the world and all its dangers.~
@35 = ~For food, I began to pawn some jewelry that I had brought with me. The first piece brought me more than I had expected, so like a fool I ran out and stayed at an expensive inn, eating and drinking like a queen. The next day I woke up to find everything was gone.~
@36 = ~That's terrible. What did you do?~
@37 = ~That happens a lot, especially to foolish people.~
@38 = ~MT: Я жила на улицах, питалась объедками на постоялых дворах и спала в заброшенной хибаре вместе с остальными бродяжками, пока меня не нашел Кенд. Кенд был друидом, он увидел меня на улице. Ему стало жалко такое юное, несчастное создание, и он убедил меня пойти с ним, взял под свое крыло как подопечную. Когда я подросла, я влюбилась в него, а он в меня.~ /*I was living on the street, eating scraps from inns and sleeping in an old shanty with some other homeless people, until Kend found me. Kend was a druid who saw me on the street.*/
@39 = ~Yes, I was foolish. But then, most young people are. We make bad choices and we pay the penalty. My path was dificult, but not the worst.~
@40 = ~He taught me the ways of nature and how to choose the right path. We spent many years together. He... he died last year and I buried him in the woods. I hope that someone helps save the Spirit soon. I would like to go and visit his grave again.~
@41 = ~What do you mean, the Spirit?~
@42 = ~Maybe you could answer some other questions now?~
@43 = ~Thank you for telling me your story. Take care and farewell.~
@44 = ~The Spirit of the Wood is causing creatures to attack anyone in or near the forest. You should talk to Aawill if you are interested in helping.~
@45 = ~I see you have returned. What may I do for you?~
@46 = ~MT: Вы согласились помочь нашему лесу? Это трудная задача, удачи вам. Да пребудет с вами Сильванус.~ /*Better safe than sorry. Have a potion, then, and Tyr be with you.*/
@47 = ~MT: Благодаря тебе наш лес снова живет прежней жизнью. Благодарю тебя, пусть тебе всегда сопутствует удача!~ /*You haven't saved me yet. I'll thank you when you have.*/
@48 = ~MT: Благодаря тебе наш лес снова живет прежней жизнью, а я наконец смогу сходить на могилу Кенда. Благодарю тебя, пусть тебе всегда сопутствует удача!~ /*The leopard swishes its tail agitatedly and watches you with wary eyes, obviously not caring for your presence.*/
@49 = ~MT: Дух леса мертв! Наш лес никогда не станет прежним, это огромная потеря!~ /*I work on a farm and I never expected to see someone who is dirtier than me!*/
