@0 = ~Hello! I come from Neverwinter for help. A plague is rampant in my city and it is clearly not of natural origin. Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher have sent me to Ascathla to find heroes to help Neverwinter. Perhaps you can help.~
@1 = ~I'm not interested. Find someone else.~
@2 = ~Well, I guess I'll try to help. Where is this city located?~
@3 = ~It's north of Athkatla. If you agree to help, I will teleport you to Lady Aribeth at the Neverwinter Academy.~
@4 = ~Not now.~
@5 = ~Yes, I'm ready.~
@6 = ~Well, I'll be waiting for you here.~
@7 = ~Then get ready, now you will find yourself in the Neverwinter Academy. Lady Aribeth will explain everything to you in detail.~
@8 = ~You're back. Does that mean you're going to help us?~
