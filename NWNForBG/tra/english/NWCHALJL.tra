@0 = ~Welcome to the Cracked Anvil. I'm Haljal Throndor, and I reckon you're here to dither and bargain me right out of business, aren't ye, stranger?~
@1 = ~What can I purchase here?~
@2 = ~Let me see what I can buy.~
@3 = ~I have some questions about the surrounding region.~
@4 = ~I've got what I need. See you around, Haljal.~
@5 = ~NP: Well, we have a wide range of products, considering we're a general store in a nice town like Port Llast. Why don't you see with your own eyes?~ /*Well, our selection of goods run the gamut, being as that we're the general store for the good town of Port Llast. As well, my smith over there can show you a wider selection of weapons if you wish. Why don't you take a look yourself?*/
@6 = ~NP: Not a problem, old man. Not a problem at all. Here, choose.~ /*No. That trouble be too much... trouble.*/
@7 = ~NP: Well, come on in<SIRMAAM> . It's always a pleasure to do business with you.~ /*Be stopping back again, good <PRO_LADYLORD>. Your business is always welcome.*/
@8 = ~Sometimes I hear stories about an area, sometimes I don't. Though when I do, it's usually about a place like the Neverwinter Wood, Charwood, or even Luskan sometimes.~
@9 = ~Have you heard any news from Charwood?~
@10 = ~Have you heard any news from the Neverwinter Wood?~
@11 = ~Have you heard any news from Luskan?~
@12 = ~NP: Thanks, next time.~ /*Another time, perhaps.*/
@13 = ~NP: Yeah, this place has always been strange, but recently some adventurers passed through here, so their story was even stranger. It seems that the people in the city are now wandering like ghosts, everyone is experiencing some kind of past horror. It seems like, if they are to be believed, all those souls are now at peace, one way or another.~ /*Aye, the place has always been strange but some adventurers came through recently with a tale that was stranger yet.*/
@14 = ~NP: Thanks, I'll go.~ /*Thanks, byes.*/
@15 = ~To be true, there hasn't been much coming from Charwood in quite some time. Perhaps it's for the better, too. I hear tell it's a spooky place.~
@16 = ~NP: Here a group of adventurers stopped to replenish supplies, and they said that someone had poisoned, they say, the Forest Spirit. They didn't say how the problem was solved, they just said that they sorted it out one way or another.~ /*An adventuring group stopped by to re-equip and mentioned that someone had poisoned the Spirit of the Wood out that way.*/
@17 = ~Not a peep coming out of them woods, so far as I were to say, though I haven't spoken with many who'd been through there.~
@18 = ~Know someone who might have gone there recently?~
@19 = ~NP: In fact, Ballard goes there all the time. Maybe you need to talk to him. He's hanging around in a grove to the northeast of Port Llast. You have to go beyond the walls of the city to get into the grove.~ /*Actually, Ballard goes out that way now and then. You might want to talk to him. He's in the northwest section of Port Llast. You'll find him in a small grove of trees.*/
@20 = ~Well, I heard word from a merchant friend about... well, what am I saying? I wouldn't want to get my friend in trouble, repeating tales meant for my ears alone.~
@21 = ~Can't you just tell me without mentioning names?~
@22 = ~NP: Oh. Okay... so be it. You can probably tell. You are a reliable person, right? Yeah. It is said that there was a big quarrel between the High Captains, and this greatly damaged the trading operations. A brave hero like you may find a way to turn this situation to his advantage, and solve local problems at the same time.~ /*A brave hero like yourself might be finding a way to exploit that situation to his own benefit, and resolve the problems therein at the time.*/
@23 = ~I'm sorry, but my friend is one I cannot risk hurting. Not for a situation such as this would be, at any rate.~
