@0 = ~MT: Be careful not to go down into the sewers - I have heard stories about some crazy people.~ /*Stay here, Sir Karathis. Perhaps I can help you yet.*/
@1 = ~MT: Recently, Kallik's men dragged a woman into the basement of a tavern. Looks like she's still there.~ /*Don't talk like that! Stop it, this isn't like you!*/
@2 = ~MT: I heard that there was a split among the bloody sailors who settled in this region. Some support Vengaul, while others have defected to Kallik.~ /*She was a hero of our people, once. Until she fell and betrayed us to Morag.*/
@3 = ~MT: On the second floor, some strange gnome settled with us. All the time he sits in his room, even asks to bring food to him there.~ /*Through the flames, some other strange place can just barely be seen. You can tell nothing else from your examination.*/
@4 = ~MT: Vengaul spread rumors that one of the ingredients for the pestilence cure would be up for auction. It seems the auction has been cancelled, I know why.~ /*I don't spread rumors. Besides, Meldanen is not known for his patience or gentle business acumen. I do not wish to be on his bad side.*/
@5 = ~MT: Lieutenant Kallik is an impatient and greedy man... Perhaps he has taken... some measures to get rid of the leaders of the bloody sailors of old Vengaul.~ /*I don't know. I have heard rumblings... His lieutenant Callik is an impatient and greedy man... I can't say much more about this.*/
@6 = ~MT: This guy, Kristov, is kind of weird. He stands at the bar all the time, and he drinks almost nothing. And Jalek seems to be following him.~ /*This object appears to be some manner of lever or handle, oddly sculpted and made of a bluish marble material.*/
@7 = ~MT: If you meet priests of Helm on the street, don't trust them. All these blessings of theirs are worth nothing, and the priests themselves are somehow suspicious.~ /*If you are threatening me to get gold, someone already beat you to it. I've nothing, no matter what you do. Just ask your questions and go.*/
