@0 = ~How in the name of the gods did you get in here?! Prepare to be destroyed, utterly!~ [NWWAN050]
@1 = ~Please! Attack no more! I am defeated!~ [NWWAN051]
@2 = ~Perhaps I was too rash in attacking you. Please, accept my apology.~ [NWWAN052]
@3 = ~Perhaps you had better answer my questions before I finish what you started.~
@4 = ~Apologies won't save you now, mage! Die!~
@5 = ~I should like to counter that with a question of my own. Why are you in my home?~
@6 = ~Who are you, exactly?~
@7 = ~That isn't how it works. You answer my questions or I kill you.~
@8 = ~Then I shall blast you into dust!~
@9 = ~I am Wanev, a man well-versed in the magical arts and of no small renown. I am somewhat displeased at being defeated by you. My idiot friends will have many a jest at my expense.~
@10 = ~I have been sent here to take a magical gem from you.~
@11 = ~I want your valuables. Anything and everything of value.~
@12 = ~I don't have any questions.~
@13 = ~There's a staircase to the upper floors, but for some reason I can't get through it.~
@14 = ~You are of no use to me. Die!~
@15 = ~What questions do you have?~
@16 = ~(sigh) I've been defeated by a common houseburglar? Fine, take my gold you barbaric leech!~
@17 = ~Come on, you must have more than that. Hand it over!~
@18 = ~That is not enough! Give me more or I'll feed you a foot of sharpened steel!~
@19 = ~I appreciate not being killed. Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be.~
@20 = ~I appreciate not being killed.~
@21 = ~Will you not even leave me enough to feed myself?! Take it and begone!~
@22 = ~Stop, please! If you are so vey desperate take this and begone!~
@23 = ~There is no more gold. I shall be henceforth known as 'Wanev the Idiot Pauper' by those bastards in the Gibbering Twelve! My reputation is ruined!~
@24 = ~So the Serpent still seeks an easy way home. Well, he shall have to become used to disappointment. He cannot have the gem.~
@25 = ~I have been hired to get the gem and I intend to get it. Hand it over now!~
@26 = ~You don't understand! I have lost the gem and am quite unable to retrieve it, despite my powers. You would be wise to forget about this job and leave now.~
@27 = ~That is not acceptable. Tell me what happened to the gem.~
@28 = ~I do not care to listen to your excuses. Tell me where the gem is or suffer the consequences.~
@29 = ~Well, if you wish to get yourself killed, why should I care?~
@30 = ~No need to get nasty. I'll tell you.~
@31 = ~I had heard that Elaith intended to take this gem and prior to receiving that information I had taken little interest in the bauble. I wondered why he intended to steal it. To be honest, I am not a patient man. I had better things to do than search through my library trying to match the description of the gem to one of the artifacts in the books. So, I thought it wise to summon an imp or some sort of lesser demon and make him do the legwork. There was, uh, a bit of a setback.~ 
@32 = ~I was somewhat less than careful with the preparations and the little fiend escaped the summoning circle. Let this be a lesson about casting when drunk. The wretch expanded the portal and began to bring forth his demonic minions. I sealed off the area as fast as I could and sobered up.~ 
@33 = ~And the gem?~
@34 = ~I don't care. Goodbye.~ 
@35 = ~In my haste, I left the gem in my summoning chamber. So you see, the area is quite full of demonic adversaries and the gem lies within, most likely stolen by that spiteful imp!~
@36 = ~Where is this area and how do I get there?~
@37 = ~You can go there by that ladder behind you, though I sealed it with my magic for safety's sake.~
@38 = ~Break the magical seals and I shall get the gem myself.~
@39 = ~Is there anything in the area that could help me get through without becoming demon fodder?~
@40 = ~Take this scroll. The spell written on it will remove the magic seal from the stairs and know this: if you should be able to close the demon portal, I would be most grateful. The gem is yours regardless. What say you?~
@41 = ~I will attempt to close the portal as I search for the gem.~
@42 = ~If the reward is good.~
@43 = ~I'm not interested. I just want the gem.~
@44 = ~If there was a trick to it, I could have pulled it off myself.~
@45 = ~It's too dangerous. Goodbye.~
@46 = ~You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash. Please return to me when you have closed the portal for I shall try to find a suitable reward in the meantime.~ 

@48 = ~Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be.~
@49 = ~I'm sure I can dig up some magical equipment of no small worth while you try to set things right.~
@50 = ~Very well. If you change your mind, I would be grateful. Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be.~
@51 = ~Very well. If you change your mind, I would be grateful.~
@52 = ~I sealed it with my magic. I thought it wise to summon an imp or some sort of lesser demon and make him do the legwork. There was, uh, a bit of a setback.

The wretch expanded the portal and began to bring forth his friends. I sealed off the area as fast as I could and sobered up.~
@53 = ~I'll help you solve this problem, for a fee of course.~
@54 = ~All right! Take this scroll. The spell written on it will remove the magic seal from the stairs and know this: if you should be able to close the demon portal, I would be most grateful. You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash. Please return to me when you have closed the portal for I shall try to find a suitable reward in the meantime.~
@55 = ~I'll do it. I hope the reward is worthy!~

@57 = ~What do you want now? Don't be rash and attack me again.~ [NWWAN053]
@58 = ~You mentioned that you had lost the gem?~
@59 = ~I think it's time for you to say goodbye to life. Die!~
@60 = ~I don't want anything. Goodbye.~
@61 = ~Indeed. I made a mistake when summoning that imp and he opened up a demonic portal in my summoning chambers.~
@62 = ~Goodbye. Try not to break anything here.~
@63 = ~Greetings. Have you changed your mind about attempting to close the portal?~ [NWWAN054]
@64 = ~Hello, again. Have you managed to kill the imp and close the portal?~ [NWWAN055]
@65 = ~I haven't closed the portal yet.~
@66 = ~What was I supposed to do again?~
@67 = ~The portal has been closed.~
@68 = ~Please return to me when you have closed the portal.~
@69 = ~You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash.~
@70 = ~Ah, excellent. Here is a reward for your troubles. A bruised ego and the loss of a couple of magic items are a small price to pay for having my summoning chamber back.~
@71 = ~We are both of the same race. Surely you could take that into consideration and offer a bit more.~
@72 = ~I've just saved your home from a demon infestation. I want a bigger reward.~
@73 = ~Why don't you throw a little extra in so I won't have to hurt you again?~
@74 = ~That is sufficient. See you later!~
@75 = ~Why not, my friend! Here is some extra coin!~
@76 = ~Hmm. You have saved me a great deal of trouble! Here is some extra coin!~
@77 = ~The reward I've given you is quite valuable and quite sufficient.~
@78 = ~Calmly, friend. There is no reason for violence. Take my last coins, then!~
@79 = ~Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you'd like.~
@80 = ~Sure. That would be good.~
@81 = ~I'll find my own way out.~
@82 = ~Very well. Goodbye.~

@84 = ~The portal has been closed.~
@85 = ~Hmm. You have saved me a great deal of trouble! Here is some extra coin! Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you'd like.~
@86 = ~The reward I've given you is quite valuable and quite sufficient. Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you'd like.~
