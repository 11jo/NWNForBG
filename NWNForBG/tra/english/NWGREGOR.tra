@0 = ~Hail! You don't look like one of Kurth's or Baram's soldiers. Best stay off the streets if you can, then, stranger... it's not safe, as you can plainly see.~
@1 = ~What do you mean? Kurth's? Baram's?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Hmm. You really are a stranger, then, if you don't know what I speak of. Most sane folk of Luskan stay indoors, now, if they know what's good for them.~
@6 = ~Me? The name's Gregor. I was hired by the brothel, here, to try and keep some of the worse elements roaming the city from making their way to our doorstep.~
@7 = ~What brothel?~
@8 = ~Who do you have to fight? What are these elements?~ 
@9 = ~If you like, go ahead.~
@10 = ~Do you know anything about cults in the city?~
@11 = ~What is going on in Luskan?~
@12 = ~I am new to the city. I need directions.~
@13 = ~Aye, be safe.~
@14 = ~Miss Bela's, of course, on the island here. Kurth and Baram both have an interest in keeping it open... but there are enough vandals and thieves about, regardless.~
@15 = ~Hmmm. Can't say that I do. The Arcane Brotherhood is quite thorough in ensuring there's no groups of great power other than themselves.~
@16 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@17 = ~You haven't been here for the fighting? It's been going on for, oh, a couple of weeks now. Out of the blue the High Captains started trying to kill each other. Nobody knows why... most think they've gone insane. Each of the High Captains has their own army, however, and they've been tearing Luskan apart.~ 
@18 = ~What they do to city?~
@19 = ~Can nobody stop the fighting?~
@20 = ~Tell me about these High Captains.~
@21 = ~Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn't it? Where do you need to go?~ 
@22 = ~Where is the nearest inn?~
@23 = ~Where is the nearest temple?~
@24 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@25 = ~Just give me an overview of the area.~
@26 = ~Actually, I'd rather ask you about something else.~
@27 = ~Wererats. Lycanthropes. Baram's men. Seems like all of his soldiers are infected, now. Kurth's men have looted the city of enchanted weapons just to fight them.~
@28 = ~A group of wizards who hole up in the Host Tower and control the city. Or, at least, they used to. They aren't telling the High Captains anything, now, as far as we can tell.~
@29 = ~Where is the wizards' tower located?~ 
@30 = ~You don't think they rule the city anymore?~
@31 = ~Look around you. Many people have been drafted into their armies and killed... or just slaughtered in the streets. Homes have been sacked and burned. The ports are completely shut down, the gates have been sealed. We're all trapped here in this mess.~ 
@32 = ~Hmph. I'm sure the northern lords outside of Luskan are cheering all this on; they won't stop it. The Arcane Brotherhood might, but they haven't done anything.~
@33 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@34 = ~There were five of them, before... all pirate lords set up to rule the city together at the pleasure of the Arcane Brotherhood. Now it seems they're going to fight until there's only one left standing... or Luskan is in ruins, maybe. Just two are left, now, as far as anybody can tell... High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurth.~
@35 = ~Tell me about Baram.~
@36 = ~Tell me about Kurth.~
@37 = ~It's on an island to the northwest, by the mouth of the river. There's one bridge across, but nobody can cross it without the Brotherhood's leave... magical wards and all that, I suppose.~
@38 = ~Hard to believe that anyone rules the city anymore. The wizards don't come out... they could be dead, for all we know... and the High Captains have all gone mad.~
@39 = ~Baram is a sneaky one. I didn't think he'd make it this long... especially after Kurth torched his base down in the slums. Nobody knows where he is now. His wererats are everywhere, though... and everyone says he has more monsters and even demons under his control.~ 
@40 = ~He was the most powerful High Captain before, no surprise he still lives. Baram still managed to burn down his tower, though. People say he's gone and walled himself up in the West Harbor district, and nobody can get in or out of there. Don't know if that's true, though. What is true is that his men, the Bloody Hands, are vicious killers. If they see you on the streets, they'll think you're with Baram. Avoid them.~ 
@41 = ~The Cutlass Inn still operates, I think. It's just past the ford, north of here.~ 
@42 = ~Hmmm. I had heard the temple of Tyr was sacked, but that may not be true. Go to the east... The temple is there.~ 
@43 = ~Aye. There be a few merchants off in the west part of the district. They be poorly-equipped, though, and until the Mirabar district is opened up they'll stay that way.~
@44 = ~What's this Mirabar district?~
@45 = ~Well, let's see. You have Miss Bela's here, on the island. To the north is the slums. There are still some merchants to the west. Much of the remainder of the city is closed off. Most of the streets are dangerous... so be careful.~
@46 = ~It's the trade district on the other side of the river. The pirates have blockaded it right now... the river entry is closed, so you can't even get there. The High Captains burnt a lot of the warehouses down, there, until the pirates got mad and closed it off. Like I said, though, there's no way to go there until all this madness ends.~ 
@47 = ~Greetings, <SIRMAAM>! Did you miss old Gregor? What can I do for you?~
@48 = ~Thank you for the assistance. Bloody creatures seem to be everywhere, now. My advice is to stay off the streets like most everyone else.~
@49 = ~What are these elements?~
