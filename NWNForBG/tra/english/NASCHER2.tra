@0 = ~We meet again, <CHARNAME>. As you know, I am Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter. I was once an adventurer like you - though that was long ago.~ [NASHE115]
@1 = ~Aarin Gend tells me you have done much in the defense of our city. For this I thank you, though I fear it was all in vain.~ [NASHE116]
@2 = ~Aribeth knows our defenses too well, we could not stand against her forces. The enemy has breached our walls. All is lost.~ [NASHE117]
@3 = ~And what good has that done, Aarin? We have no way to use them. Whatever magic is locked within those stone tablets is of no use to us.~ [NASHE119]
@4 = ~I don't trust that creature, Aarin, and neither should you! We have done her no harm. If she was truly our ally she would tell us what she knows.~ [NASHE121]
@5 = ~And what good has that done, Aarin? That creature won't tell us anything about it. The Source Stone is as useless to us as the Words of Power.~ [NASHE123]
@6 = ~Enough, Aarin. <CHARNAME>, if you want to speak to Haedraline you are free to do so. But I will not release her from the dungeon while an enemy is within our city gates.~ [NASHE125]
@7 = ~Personally, I think this is all a waste of time: Words of Power, the Source Stone, Haedraline. What good is this against Aribeth's army? Our fate is sealed... we are all doomed.~ [NASHE126]
@8 = ~Lord Nasher, may I ask you some questions?~
@9 = ~I must be on my way.~
@10 = ~After all you have done for the city, the least I can do is answer your questions, <CHARNAME> - though Gend probably knows more than I do.~ [NASHE127]
@11 = ~What can you tell me about Haedraline?~
@12 = ~What can you tell me about the Words of Power that were brought here earlier?~
@13 = ~What can you tell me about the Source Stone?~
@14 = ~What's the latest news from the battle lines?~
@15 = ~I want to ask you about Aribeth.~
@16 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>, of course. But before you go... maybe Gend is right. Maybe you should go speak to this Haedraline creature.~ [NASHE175]
@17 = ~Come and go as you please, <CHARNAME>. You've earned that right. Perhaps if Neverwinter had more people like you things wouldn't look so bleak.~ [NASHE178]
@18 = ~We captured the lizardwoman slinking around the city shortly after Luskan attacked. After Aribeth's betrayal I'm not too trusting, so we keep her locked in a cell in the dungeon.~ [NASHE128]
@19 = ~I've given them to Master Ford, chief archeologist of Neverwinter. He seems to think there's some link between the Words and the Source Stone.~ [NASHE135]
@20 = ~When we first captured Haedraline she said something about the Source Stone and secret chambers beneath Castle Never. She sounded half crazy, but I though it was worth looking into.~ [NASHE139]
@21 = ~The reports are grim. In the initial assault Luskan overwhelmed us with sheer numbers and the unbridled ferocity of their attack. The defenders were forced to fall back to the City Core.~ [NASHE142]
@22 = ~I understand you have an interest in her fate, <CHARNAME>, and I see you will not be satisfied until I answer your question.~ [NASHE165]
@23 = ~I doubt it will do much good, but maybe - just maybe - she knows something that can save us. We're desperate, after all.~ [NASHE176]
@24 = ~Any important information you come across should be reported directly to Aarin Gend. I've placed him in charge of the defense of the city.~ [NASHE177]
@25 = ~She was hissing and babbling about Maugrim wanting the Words of Power and the Source Stone, but we couldn't get much else out of her.~ [NASHE129]
@26 = ~Initially, I hoped he could figure out how to unleash their power, but, even as wise as Master Ford is, he hasn't been able to learn anything more about the Words of Power or the Source Stone.~ [NASHE136]
@27 = ~Where can I find Master Ford?~
@28 = ~I would like to ask you something else.~
@29 = ~I put Master Ford, Neverwinter's leading archeological expert, in charge of the search. He unearthed a previously undiscovered chamber beneath the castle.~ [NASHE140]
@30 = ~Aribeth knew our defenses too well, we never stood a chance. My troops are loyal, but against such odds there's little hope. It's only a matter of time until Castle Never itself falls.~ [NASHE143]
@31 = ~What if I could kill Aribeth and Maugrim?~
@32 = ~Is there no one who will come to our aid?~
@33 = ~Even without Maugrim and Aribeth to lead them, the Luskan fury is unabated. We will never last long enough for the Lords' Alliance reinforcements to arrive.~ [NASHE149]
@34 = ~Even without Maugrim and Aribeth to lead them, the Luskan fury is unabated. We will never last long enough for the Lords' Alliance reinforcements to arrive.~ [NASHE149]
@35 = ~Aribeth? She is a traitor! The sentence for her crimes is death...~ [NASHE168]
@36 = ~But it is no easy question to answer. Aribeth has brought death to Neverwinter. For this the law states she must die.~ [NASHE166]
@37 = ~She's half mad, I fear, and doesn't seem to trust us. Gend seems to think she might trust you, though. You're free to speak with her in the dungeons if you wish.~ [NASHE130]
@38 = ~Where can I find Haedraline?~
@39 = ~Can you let Haedraline out of the dungeon?~
@40 = ~Since we discovered the Source Stone in the secret chambers beneath Castle Never, Master Ford has spent all his time studying it.~ [NASHE137]
@41 = ~Gend can probably answer your questions better than I, but I'll help you if I can.~ [NASHE134]
@42 = ~I'm interested in knowing more about you, Lord Nasher.~
@43 = ~Inside was an enormous crystalline boulder - the Source Stone. If you want to know more about it you should speak with Master Ford.~ [NASHE141]
@44 = ~It is too late for that I fear. Our defenses are already broken, the damage has been done.~ [NASHE144]
@45 = ~Reinforcements from the Lords' Alliance are marching, but they are too far away. By the time they arrive all that will remain of Neverwinter is burnt bodies and charred rubble.~ [NASHE148]
@46 = ~Some sinister power drives our enemies forward - I feel it in my weary old bones. Or perhaps this is simply justice for what I have done.~ [NASHE150]
@47 = ~What do you mean?~
@48 = ~I did not ask for your opinion on this matter, Gend. What do you know of such things?~ [NASHE169]
@49 = ~And yet I remember another who was sentenced by the same law to death. Fenthick, Aribeth's lover... I cannot help but wonder if there is a lesson to be learned there.~ [NASHE167]
@50 = ~The law is the law, Lord Nasher. Aribeth deserves death.~
@51 = ~There can be no forgiveness for what Aribeth has done, Lord Nasher. She deserves death.~
@52 = ~Her death will only continue the cycle of vengeance and bloodshed.~
@53 = ~She's locked away in the castle dungeon. Just head south and down the stairs.~ [NASHE131]
@54 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but I won't do that. Not while there's an enemy inside the city. She might be an ally, but it's just as likely she's a spy.~ [NASHE132]
@55 = ~You can go speak to him to see what he's discovered, if you wish - though you might have more luck getting information from that creature Haedraline, if you can get her to talk.~ [NASHE138]
@56 = ~Once I was an adventurer like you, <CHARNAME>. Were the situation not so desperate I would call upon the court bards to sing you tales of my exploits.~ [NASHE172]
@57 = ~If Aribeth and Maugrim were both slain, there is a chance it might break the spirits of the Luskan invaders. But I wouldn't count on it.~ [NASHE145]
@58 = ~The blood of Fenthick is on my hands. After the plague the mob cried for blood, and I gave it to them. Fenthick was guilty only of trusting Desther - he was no enemy of Neverwinter.~ [NASHE151]
@59 = ~You... you told me you would not serve a master who did not do what was right. Are you saying it was wrong to execute Fenthick, Gend?~ [NASHE170]
@60 = ~Besides, we aren't doing her any harm. Only keeping an eye on her. And if she has information to help us, she should be willing to share it whether we keep her in prison or not.~ [NASHE133]
@61 = ~But I am long since retired. I am ruler of Neverwinter now and my life is one of administrative duties and the delegation of responsibility. Hardly the stirring stuff of legends.~ [NASHE173]
@62 = ~I miss those days of glory and heroism, <CHARNAME>. But I gave them up to serve the city I love. Alas, my sacrifice was all in vain. Neverwinter will fall and I can do nothing about it.~ [NASHE174]
@63 = ~The Luskans attacked with a rage and ferocity I have never seen before. Some sinister force drives our enemies forward.~ [NASHE146]
@64 = ~And yet I saw him hanged for failing to protect the city, as was his sworn duty. Can we really be so surprised Aribeth betrayed us after we executed her lover?~ [NASHE152]
@65 = ~You followed the law, Lord Nasher. You had no choice.~
@66 = ~What is done is done, Lord Nasher. No sense dwelling on it now.~
@67 = ~Fenthick's execution may have been wrong, but it does not excuse Aribeth's betrayal!~
@68 = ~Perhaps you can atone for what you have done.~
@69 = ~I... I do not wish to discuss this anymore. Aribeth's fate is not ours to decide, and I have no time for philosophical debates. Is there more I can do for you, <CHARNAME>?~ [NASHE171]
@70 = ~Or perhaps this is justice, of a sort. Neverwinter may have brought this doom upon itself.~ [NASHE147]
@71 = ~That is what I tell myself over and over, <CHARNAME>. But the words are hollow to my own ears.~ [NASHE153]
@72 = ~You... you are asking me to show Aribeth mercy? After what she did? After raising an army against Neverwinter and slaughtering her people?~ [NASHE156]
@73 = ~You're right. She deserves death.~
@74 = ~I fear it is too late for that, <CHARNAME>. Fenthick is dead and Aribeth... Perhaps if I were given the chance to pass judgment again I would act differently. More mercifully.~ [NASHE163]
@75 = ~I only wanted to do what was best for Neverwinter, to heal the wounds left by the Wailing Death. Yet even as I passed sentence on Fenthick, I knew in my heart it was wrong. This was not justice.~ [NASHE154]
@76 = ~And so she shall have it, <CHARNAME>, but now is not the time. We are fighting a war, and Aribeth can give us much information about our enemy.~ [NASHE157]
@77 = ~NP: Aribet's crimes can't be dismissed out of hand. And yet. there is some truth to what you say.~ [NASHE160] /*Aribeth's crimes cannot simply be forgiven with a wave of the hand, <CHARNAME>. And yet... there is truth in your words.*/
@78 = ~But I fear that chance shall never come. I must live with the burden of what I have done, as must my city. Neverwinter will fall.~ [NASHE164]
@79 = ~Fenthick died to feed the city's lust for revenge. Now Neverwinter shall fall to an army that was raised to feed Aribeth's own vengeance. Perhaps that is justice.~ [NASHE155]
@80 = ~Maybe you got chance for make it all better.~
@81 = ~As long as we battle the Luskan forces, Aribeth is too valuable to be slain. However, if the walls of Castle Never fall I shall slay her myself rather than let her go free.~ [NASHE158]
@82 = ~I have often wondered if I made a mistake in Fenthick's sentence. Had he lived, perhaps none of this would have happened. At the very least he could have worked to atone for his mistakes.~ [NASHE161]
@83 = ~Rest assured, justice will be served when the time comes, <CHARNAME>. Is that all?~ [NASHE159]
@84 = ~Perhaps Fenthick deserved a second chance. Perhaps we all do. I... I must think carefully on this matter before my decision is made.~ [NASHE162]
@85 = ~By some miracle the city still stands, and Aarin Gend clings to the hope we may yet survive. But I am older and wiser; I harbor no such illusions.~ [NASHE113]
@86 = ~That is why I have placed Gend in charge of the defense of the city. Let him handle the reports flooding in - I have no stomach for it anymore.~ [NASHE114]
@87 = ~These are strange times, <CHARNAME>. My city is in ruins and all but overrun by Luskan forces, and yet Aribeth, the leader of our enemy, sits in our dungeons awaiting my judgment.~ [NASHE106]
@88 = ~Were things not so grim I might laugh at the absurdity of it all. (sigh) What is it you need of me, <CHARNAME>?~ [NASHE107]
@89 = ~What are you planning to do with Aribeth?~
@90 = ~Aribeth is in your dungeon? What are you talking about?~
@91 = ~NP: It is an honor to speak with you. You are now a hero of Neverwinter, your name will forever be written in the history of the city!~ /*Mommy says you're the hero of Neverwinter. I want to be a hero!*/
@92 = ~And what good will this Word do us? We already have three of the damn things!~ [NASHE179]
@93 = ~And just how are we supposed to do that, Gend? Do you know how to use them?~ [NASHE180]
@94 = ~You should quit wasting Gend's time, <CHARNAME>. Go speak with Haedraline if you think the Word is any use.~ [NASHE181]
@95 = ~While the war rages on, she will live. She can provide us valuable information about our enemy's tactics and numbers.~ [NASHE108]
@96 = ~As for her fate when this is all over... that is a matter I have not yet decided. Such matters are to be decided later.~ [NASHE109]
@97 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>. I assumed you would have heard the news by now. Aribeth has surrendered herself to us. She seeks atonement for her crimes against Neverwinter.~ [NASHE110]
@98 = ~At first I thought it was some trick, but she has given us valuable information about the Luskan army that has allowed many of our people to escape a brutal end.~ [NASHE111]
@99 = ~The city may not survive, but Aribeth's actions have spared the lives of many innocents. Though these must be weighed against the thousands she has helped slay.~ [NASHE112]
