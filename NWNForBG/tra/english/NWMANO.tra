@0 = ~NP: Greetings. You must be the new recruit. No one else has the stupidity to go near the Beggar's Nest gates. Uh... Uh, if you'll excuse me. one moment. The smell of burning corpses makes me sick... As if the plague wasn't enough on its own. And now the Beggars Nest has become a nightmare! Did you hear that?~ /*Ugh... I'm sorry... give me a moment. The smell of the burning corpses is getting to me... As if the plague isn't bad enough on it's own. And now the Beggar's Nest is even worse! Have you heard?*/
@1 = ~It's a nightmare in there. Zombies are everywhere. We're keeping the City Core secure, but damned if we can do much for the Nest.~
@2 = ~Is this area quarantined? Do you let anyone in or out?~
@3 = ~Beggar's Nest closed? You stop sick by stopping people?~
@4 = ~Have you heard anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@5 = ~Farewell. Wish me luck.~
@6 = ~NP: You're a guard, you'll have no problem getting in. We're keeping it closed. The pestilence situation in the Nest is worse than anywhere else, and now we have the undead. Because of the zombies, a lot of people stay indoors and don't go out, so there have been almost no clashes with the guards, and people don't try to break the quarantine anymore.~ /*The zombie threat is keeping people in their homes, so there haven't been many confrontations between the guards and people trying to break quarantine.*/
@7 = ~NP: Ah yes, they say you've made some progress in finding them. But beyond that, I can't say I know anything useful. Perhaps you can help us, but my hope is not as strong as it once was. It seems to me that all the creatures have died. Of course, death hasn't stopped all the zombies in the Nest. There's a lot of nonsense going on everywhere right now.~ /*Ah yes, I had heard you were making progress finding them. Aside from what you have done, I can't say I have heard anything good.*/
@8 = ~NP: Aribeth sent you to find them, didn't she? I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I don't know anything about them. They're probably all dead. Of course, death didn't stop all the zombies in the Nest. It doesn't make any sense right now.~ /*Aribeth has you looking for those, hmm? Sorry, I can't help you. I haven't heard anything about them. They are probably all dead.*/
@9 = ~I will, but I don't hold much hope for the district. It's the worst hit by the plague and now the undead are killing everything...~
@10 = ~The Helmites were allowed in to establish a shrine. I hear they continue to grant blessings. I doubt they counted on the undead infestation though.~
@11 = ~Is there anywhere I should go, specifically?~
@12 = ~Is this the last outpost of city guards?~
@13 = ~There's a tavern. The Shining Serpent. It's in the south central of the Beggar's Nest. Harben Ashensmith is there, organizing people.~
@14 = ~Who is Harben Ashensmith?~
@15 = ~NP: There are guards on the other side of the gate. They are supposed to keep order and stop unrest among the victims of the pestilence, but now they mostly fight the undead. It's a terribly difficult job. We don't have enough men to keep patrolling. I hope you can help us with that.~ /*There are some on the other side of the gate. They were supposed to keep the plague victims from rioting, but now they must contain the undead.*/
@16 = ~NP: He's a friend of the guards. I don't know what his official rank is. He doesn't like to use it. He prefers to operate unofficially. He can give you more information than I can. If he's still out there, that means he's still alive.~ /*He's a friend of the guards. I'm not sure of his official rank. He doesn't like to use it much. He prefers to stand with the rank and file.*/
@17 = ~You should speak to Harben Ashensmth. He's been organizing people to keep them safe. He's in the Shining Serpent tavern, south central area of the district.~
@18 = ~NP: <CHARNAME>, there are rumors everywhere of your exploits for Neverwinter. I think you'll solve the problems in the Beggar's Nest very quickly. Uh... I beg your pardon... one moment. The smell of burning corpses makes me sick.... As if the plague wasn't enough on its own. And now the Beggars Nest has become a nightmare! Did you hear that?~ /*Ugh... I'm sorry... give me a moment. The smell of the burning corpses is getting to me... As if the plague isn't bad enough on it's own. And now the Beggar's Nest is even worse! Have you heard?*/
@19 = ~NP: It is said that the Beggar's Nest is much safer thanks to your efforts, <CHARNAME>. Your actions will bring you deep respect here in Neverwinter.~ /*I am told the Beggar's Nest is significantly safer, thanks to your efforts, <CHARNAME>.*/
@20 = ~NP: They say the Beggar's Nest is much safer thanks to your efforts. Your actions will earn you deep respect here in Neverwinter.~ /*I am told the Beggar's Nest is significantly safer, thanks to your efforts, <CHARNAME>.*/
