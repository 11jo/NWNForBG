@0 = ~NP: I would be very grateful to you if you could give this note to my wife. If you don't agree to help me, I'll probably lose my farm. All because of that pompous, self-centered asshole Damas!~ /*I really appreciate you taking that note for my wife. If you hadn't agreed to help me, I might have lost my farm. All because of that arrogant, self-absorbed jerk Damas!*/
@1 = ~Wow! You really don't like Damas.~
@2 = ~You're pretty hard on your Commander. He's just doing his job.~
@3 = ~Do you want me to try and speak to Damas on your behalf?~
@4 = ~I'll be going now.~
@5 = ~Can you blame me? I finally get enough money to retire and buy a nice little homestead in the country and then BAM! I get conscripted into his army. Now I sit around in a suit of armor two sizes too big waiting for a Luskan soldier to split my skull. Hell of a retirement, huh?~ /*Can you blame me? I finally get enough money to retire and buy a nice little homestead in the country and then BAM! I get conscripted into his army.*/
@6 = ~Anything I can do to help?~
@7 = ~Well, he ain't doing it very damn well! The Uthgardt aren't normally on good terms with Luskan. If Damas wanted to I bet he could bargain a peace treaty and at least get the Uthgardt to call off their warriors. But he's too stubborn or too stupid or too arrogant or too blind or too bloodthirsty to even try and make peace. The guy's a complete moron.~ /*Well, he ain't doing it very damn well! The Uthgardt aren't normally on good terms with Luskan. If Damas wanted to I bet he could bargain a peace treaty and at least get the Uthgardt to call off their warriors.*/
@8 = ~NP: Surely you don't know anything about some ancient artifacts called Words of Power?~ /*You wouldn't happen to know anything about some ancient artifacts known as the Words of Power, would you?*/
@9 = ~No point in that. He doesn't listen to anyone smarter than he is, which means he doesn't listen to ANYBODY!~
@10 = ~I'd join you if I could, but until this war with Luskan is over all the conscripts have to stay here to defend Fort Ilkard. If you need anything else, you know where to find me.~
@11 = ~Nothing you can really do, unless you want to buy several hundred bushels of turnips. Wait a minute... there is something you can do! I could write up a note with instructions for my wife and a list of all the buyers she has to get in touch with to sell our crop. You could deliver the note for me!~ /*I could write up a note with instructions for my wife and a list of all the buyers she has to get in touch with to sell our crop. You could deliver the note for me!*/
@12 = ~Okay, I'll do it.~
@13 = ~I've got more important things to worry about.~
@14 = ~Oh, yeah - they're always telling us run of the mill soldiers about things like that. Hmph! Get serious. Commander Damas doesn't tell us anything. You can ask him about those Words if you want, but I don't know if he'd be any help. He's nothing but a pompous, self absorbed jerk!~ /*Oh, yeah - they're always telling us run of the mill soldiers about things like that. Hmph! Get serious. Commander Damas doesn't tell us anything.*/
@15 = ~NP: Thank you! You're gonna help me save a lot of money. Take this note to my wife and she'll know what to do. Don't worry, I'll make sure she rewards you well. My wife isn't hard to recognize - I don't think there are any other dwarves farming in that area.~ /*Thanks! This will save me a bundle. Take this note back to my wife and she'll know what to do. Don't worry, I've put down that she should give you a substantial reward for this.*/
@16 = ~Hey, I understand. It's only my living. It's only my entire life savings. Don't worry about it. Really.~
@17 = ~Hey, good to see one of my own kind here. We gnomes have to stick together! If we don't, pompous jerks like Commander Damas will just keep pushing us around.~
@18 = ~I may be just a simple gnome, but Commander Damas doesn't have the right to treat me like this! What a pompous, self-absorbed jerk!~
