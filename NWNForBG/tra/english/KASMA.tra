@0 = ~Oh, hullo. It's quite busy in here, isn't it?~
@1 = ~Probably people preparing for the competition.~
@2 = ~Yes, it is. Do you know why?~
@3 = ~It certainly is. Who are you?~
@4 = ~I will leave.~
@5 = ~Oh, yes. And people preparing to watch, as well. We should have quite a crowd. It's all very exciting! I can't wait to enter the dungeon!~
@6 = ~Aren't you nervous or afraid at all?~
@7 = ~A puny gnome like you is entering? You've no hope!~
@8 = ~MT: Все приехали из-за идеи Мутамина... искатели приключений, вроде меня, будут пытаться пройти через подземелье под таверной. Говорят, там полно ловушек и монстров... и первый, кто дойдет до конца, получит награду. Ну, и славу тоже, конечно. Насколько я понимаю, все это держится в тайне. Местные аристократы съехались сюда, чтобы полюбоваться насилием. Из этого может получится превосходная история.~ /*It's all very secretive, I understand. The noblemen are here because they like a good scandal and love to watch violence. It should make for a good story.*/
@9 = ~If you're truly interested, you might want to speak to Mutamin about it. He would know far more than I, of course.~
@10 = ~My name is Kasma. I'm a bard from Baldur's Gate. I've traveled quite a ways to take part in the competition. It's quite exciting!~
@11 = ~What's this competition you mention?~
@12 = ~All righty, then. Good luck to ya!~
@13 = ~No, not really. Just determined. I want to walk away from here with a tale to tell the countryside. Now *that* would be worth any price!~
@14 = ~If you say so. I wish you well, anyway.~
@15 = ~I wish you luck, friend! Whichever of us wins the prize, I hope you at least aren't hurt.~
@16 = ~Oh dear, this was harder than I thought.~
