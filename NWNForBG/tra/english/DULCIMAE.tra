@0 = ~Thanks for the help - I was trying to make my way safely home when those brutes found me.~
@1 = ~Who are you? What are you doing on the streets?~
@2 = ~Who says I rescued you? Hand over your gold...~
@3 = ~Do you need an escort to the district gates?~
@4 = ~You'd better go. Keep to the shadows.~
@5 = ~I'm a maid for Lady Tanglebrook. I was on my way home from my morning shift when all of... of *this* erupted!~
@6 = ~Your attackers, who were they?~
@7 = ~Are there not enough guards to keep you safe?~
@8 = ~What do you know about the prison?~
@9 = ~Wha!? Here, it's all I've got... Now leave me alone!~
@10 = ~Would you? I was thinking I'd never make it. I have to go right to Captain Kipp at the gates, though. I must tell him about what I have seen.~
@11 = ~Thanks again, I'll do that...~
@12 = ~Escapees from the prison. I heard one say that it was the Head Gaoler himself who freed them... I don't like the sound of it.~
@13 = ~The Head Gaoler, is it?~
@14 = ~With the quarantine to deal with, too? They've got their hands full, I'm afraid. Us folk have to fend for ourselves.~
@15 = ~Captain Alaefin, he's the Head Gaoler there. He runs a tight ship... or at least he used to. Some say he's the one who set these prisoners free.~
@16 = ~He's a good man, I swear he is. Why, he'd meet every afternoon in the tunnels with Lady Tanglebrook for a friendly game of chess... They're cousins, you know...~
@17 = ~Tunnels? What tunnels?~
@18 = ~With the Wailing, Lady Tanglebrook is too scared to walk the streets. Alaefin, to ease her fears, built the tunnels between the prison and her estate so they could continue their games there.~
@19 = ~Where's this estate?~
@20 = ~MT: Tanglebrook? It's at the far end of the peninsula. As I said, she is terrified of the Howling Death and locked the door behind me when I left. Maybe you could visit her, check if everything is all right. Although she is afraid, she leaves us a spare key under the rug on the lawn of her estate ..~ /*The Tanglebrook? It's at the far reach of the peninsula. As I said, though, she's right scared of the Wailing and she locked the door behind me when I left.*/
@21 = ~What, is there trouble about? I must get to the Peninsula gates and speak with Captain Kipp.~
@22 = ~Ssh, follow me.~
@23 = ~Just stay here for a moment.~
@24 = ~If you're leaving me here, oh please don't be long...~
@25 = ~There's the District gates! Thanks so much for your help, my friend.~
@26 = ~MT: Thank you so much for your help my friend.~ /*There's the District gates! Thanks so much for your help, my friend.*/
@27 = ~Bless Helm for adventurers! Things have gotten a lot better since the prison riots were finally put to rest!~
