@0 = ~Who... who are you? Look... I don't entertain here right now. I... am reserved to go elsewhere, whether I like it or not. So please leave me alone.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~You don't seem happy about that.~
@3 = ~Can I ask you a question?~
@4 = ~What you means 'elsewhere?'~
@5 = ~Bela told me to see you.~
@6 = ~Goodbye.~
@7 = ~Rhaine. My name is Rhaine. I... I have to go, soon. Could you leave, please?~
@8 = ~Can I ask you a question?~
@9 = ~I am no fan of the High Captains, and I would rather not serve their whims if I had a say in it. I do what I'm told, however.~
@10 = ~Why would you serve the High Captains if you don't want to?~
@11 = ~Why? Don't they pay well?~
@12 = ~Tell me what you know about these High Captains.~
@13 = ~Perhaps I can help you.~
@14 = ~Please, no. I'm not in the mood to talk. I have to leave soon and I... need to prepare myself.~
@15 = ~Somewhere else. Somewhere I don't want to go, but don't have a choice.~
@16 = ~She did? Why would she do that?~
@17 = ~Why do you think she'd send me to you?~
@18 = ~I said I thought the High Captains should be stopped.~
@19 = ~We were discussing the High Captains.~
@20 = ~All right, forget it.~
@21 = ~Thank you. All I wish is to be left alone.~
@22 = ~Look... I don't want to get into any trouble, and talking about the High Captains is nothing but trouble.~
@23 = ~I won't tell anyone what you say.~
@24 = ~A surer way to trouble is not to answer my questions... get it?~
@25 = ~I could pay you for the information, if you like.~
@26 = ~Nevermind, then.~
@27 = ~Hmph. You may think that a courtesan would do anything for money, but you'd be wrong.~
@28 = ~I bet some gold would change your mind...~
@29 = ~I want to know more about these High Captains.~
@30 = ~I don't speak for Miss Bela. Maybe she thinks you can help me, I don't know.~
@31 = ~Fine. I guess it doesn't really matter. I'll tell you what I know. High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurth hold us hostage, practically. Miss Bela has to do what they tell her, or they'd shut us all down... make us all slaves or worse. Oreth and I have to go to the High Captains' bases to put on a show... or do whatever else they want. We despise it, but there's nothing we can do about it.~ 
@32 = ~Yeah, right... Look, no offense, but I'd prefer it if you just left me alone, all right?~
@33 = ~(sigh) There's always one of your type about, isn't there? Fine, fine. I don't really care anymore. I'll tell you what I know. High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurth hold us hostage, practically. Miss Bela has to do what they tell her, or they'd shut us all down... make us all slaves or worse. Oreth and I have to go to the High Captains' bases to put on a show... or do whatever else they want. We despise it, but there's nothing we can do about it.~ 
@34 = ~You think I'm badly in need of gold, do you? (sigh) I suppose it doesn't really matter. I'll tell you what I know. High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurth hold us hostage, practically. Miss Bela has to do what they tell her, or they'd shut us all down... make us all slaves or worse. Oreth and I have to go to the High Captains' bases to put on a show... or do whatever else they want. We despise it, but there's nothing we can do about it.~ 
@35 = ~(sigh) I don't need any gold. I also don't need any trouble. Just leave me be, will you? I've certainly had enough of being questioned for one day.~
@36 = ~Miss Bela does her best to help us, but there's nothing she nor we can do about it. I just... I just wish someone would visit a painful, horrible death on those men. Then this would all be over.~
@37 = ~And if someone were willing to help you... ?~
@38 = ~Just what do they make you do?~
@39 = ~Who's this Oreth you mention?~
@40 = ~Can you tell me about the High Captains?~
@41 = ~Why don't you do something about it yourself?~
@42 = ~I'd gladly tell them whatever I knew, then, if it would mean those bastards' deaths.~
@43 = ~How do I find Kurth, then?~
@44 = ~How do I find Baram, then?~
@45 = ~Naw. Forgets it.~
@46 = ~Sometimes they throw me to their men. Sometimes they... I... would rather not talk about it.~
@47 = ~Who's this Oreth you mention?~
@48 = ~Aye. I know more about them than I would ever care to.~
@49 = ~Where do I find Kurth?~
@50 = ~Where can I find Baram?~
@51 = ~Tell me about Kurth.~
@52 = ~Tell me about Baram.~
@53 = ~Can they be reasoned with?~
@54 = ~I'd gladly kill them, if I could. I can't, however, and that would just get Miss Bela into more trouble than you or I could imagine... and I won't do that. Please... just leave me alone! There's nothing I can do and no one can help me!~
@55 = ~Bah! Get out of here! Get out of my room and leave me alone, already. I've had quite enough of people like you.~
@56 = ~Kurth is in the West Docks district. His men come out of a gap broken in the wall. I don't suggest that you use that. There is an opening in the ruins of his old tower. It's what I use when I must go and see him.~
@57 = ~Baram has a base within the sewers of the city, full of his troops and undead monsters conjured by his sorcerer allies. The main gate is through a sewer entrance to the north of here. His base is heavily fortified, but not impregnable. There is a back entrance that is not well-known about...~
@58 = ~Then... please just leave me alone.~
@59 = ~Oreth is one of the male courtesans that works for Miss Bela, of course. He hates it as much as I do. If you really want to talk to him, he has his own room, here.~
@60 = ~He's a madman. He's always been hungry for power, they say, but even his men think he's gone completely mad, now. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants. All he thinks about is killing Baram and taking over the city, talking about how glorious it will be. I don't believe he actually even thinks about what this all has done to Luskan.~ 
@61 = ~Baram is... a cunning man. He relies on guile more than strength, and doesn't consider any act too low or desperate to perform. He's allied with necromancers... there's undead all about his base, making his men nervous and jittery. Even Baram, himself, seems strange... I think he's done something to himself. Something unnatural.~ 
@62 = ~I don't know. They might make a deal with you, if they thought it would put them ahead of the other High Captain somehow. Whether they'd bother keeping that deal is another matter entirely.~
@63 = ~Baram has a base within the sewers of the city, full of his troops and undead monsters conjured by his sorcerer allies. The main gate is through a sewer entrance to the north of here. His base is heavily fortified, but not impregnable. There is a back entrance that is not well-known about... I have a key which could help you gain entrance... if you'd like it.~
@64 = ~That's all I can tell you about that, however.~
@65 = ~Kurth is in the West Docks district. His men come out of a gap broken in the wall. I don't suggest that you use that. There is an opening in the ruins of his old tower. It's what I use when I must go and see him. You need a key to get into his base through the tower door. To get to Baram, you also need a key, you can have them, if you wish. I don't know what you're plans are, but I bet you those bastards won't like them!~
@66 = ~Yes, give me the keys.~
@67 = ~No, I don't need any keys.~
@68 = ~You need a key to get into Kurth's base through the tower door. You can have it, if you wish. I don't know what you're plans are, but I bet you those bastards won't like them!~
@69 = ~Here... this should unlock the gratings there for you. It's well-watched, though, and using this key will ensure Baram thinks you're an enemy. I don't presume to know your business, but kill that little rat if you can. I'll be happy to know it when his days are at an end.~ 
@70 = ~Take this copy of the key to Khurt's base. Careful, however... if any of Kurth's guards see you entering there, they'll presume you're an enemy and try to kill you. Kurth deserves to die, friend... if you get the chance, don't hesitate. More Luskanites than I will thank you dearly for it.~
@71 = ~As you wish. Now leave me alone.~
@72 = ~Back again? Look, I've already told you what I have to do... what do you want from me?~
@73 = ~Can you answer some questions about the High Captains?~
@74 = ~I was hoping to hire you.~
@75 = ~I thought you should know: Baram is dead.~
@76 = ~I thought you should know: Kurth is dead.~
@77 = ~You men are all the same! Get out! Out!!~
@78 = ~Well that's a relief. Baram was almost worse than Kurth with his twisted little brain. I suppose you did the job? Of course you did, or you wouldn't know. Thank you for that, at least. You've done the city a favor. I don't suppose you might have gotten rid of Kurth while you were at it?~ 
@79 = ~Yes, actually. He's dead too.~
@80 = ~No.~
@81 = ~He is, is he? Well, that's good. That smug bastard deserves to suffer... I hope he was squealing for mercy in the end. I suppose I should thank you for getting rid of him. I don't suppose you might have gotten rid of Baram while you were at it?~ 
@82 = ~What? You... you're joking, right? No, you're not joking... I can see it in your face. That's wonderful news! Thank you, thank you! Finally I'm not under the thumb of either of those bastards! I wish I could give you some kind of reward! You've done us all a huge favor! May the gods bless you, my <LADYLORD>!~ 
@83 = ~Oh, well. I suppose things won't really change, then, once he discovers he's the only High Captain left... if he actually is. You can never tell. But thank you anyhow.~
@84 = ~Back again? I've given you a key. I hope you'll use it to kill the High Captains... or whatever it is you have planned. What else do you want?~
@85 = ~Whoever you are, miss, you've got the wrong room.~
@86 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@87 = ~My name is Rhaine. Look, miss... I don't entertain here right now, so please leave me alone.~
@88 = ~Why aren't you working?~
@89 = ~Please just leave me alone. Can't a girl just be alone in this place without being bothered? I am sure there are plenty of men about for you to talk to, miss... now get out!~
@90 = ~Somehow I think you've got the wrong room, sir. Please leave me be.~
@91 = ~I don't want to answer any questions. I'm asking you to leave me alone. Please go away.~
@92 = ~I'm sorry, but I really must go!~
