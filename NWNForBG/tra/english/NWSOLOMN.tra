@4 = ~Me no big hero...~
@5 = ~Don't waste my time.~
@6 = ~Oh, ah... pardon my rudeness, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I never meant it in that way, it's just that they didn't describe you well, is all...~
@7 = ~Why would you need my description?~
@8 = ~What?...uh, the folks around the inn, that's all I meant.~
@9 = ~Err... well, I suppose I should know for sure that you are who I think you are. I don't want to make a mistake, after all.~
@10 = ~Me <CHARNAME>. Why you want knowing?~
@11 = ~Is there a point to this?~
@12 = ~I beg to differ - you saved an entire city from a certain and horrible demise. Surely such a person deserves consideration as a hero.~
@13 = ~I'm sorry, I... just wanted to make sure it was really you. I want to thank you. I've family in Neverwinter, and you saved their lives when you cured the plague. I wanted to give you this ring as a token of my gratitude.~

It's my hope that it will bring you luck, as well... that's why I wanted to give it to you. At any rate, here... use it well, <CHARNAME>.~ /*It's my hope that it will bring you luck, as well... that's why I wanted to give it to you. At any rate, here... use it well, <CHARNAME>.*/

@23 = ~I... suppose. Here, take all the gold I have on me. It's not much, but I'm glad to give it to you along with the ring. I don't know if it is magical, but it's always brought me luck. I hope it brings you luck, too. Thank you again, <CHARNAME>... and farewell!~ /*I don't know if it is magical, but it's always brought me luck. I hope it brings you luck, too.

@33 = ~All I know is that you're in way over your head, <CHARNAME>. Consider yourself warned, 'hero'!~
@34 = ~You saved Neverwinter, you're the big hero, everybody loves you. Why gamble all of that away? The odds aren't in your favor, anyway.~
@35 = ~Don't be a fool! You've been nosing around, asking questions. The entire North knows what you're up to by now.~
@36 = ~You do that. Ignore my advice and suffer the consequences. Consider this your fair warning, 'hero'!~
@37 = ~Oh, it's very much my business, actually. We won't tolerate your interference any further. Consider this your fair warning, 'hero'!~
@38 = ~I warned you but you just wouldn't listen.~ [NWSOL054]
