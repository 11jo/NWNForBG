@0 = ~Y-you really shouldn't be here. I'm g-guarding this place, and I can't speak to you unless Oleff sent you to find the tombs of Never.~
@1 = ~What is this place?~
@2 = ~Who is Oleff?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~It is a holy place, but I cannot speak of it to you. Please, I guard this place for the church of Tyr. You should not be here.~
@5 = ~Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar. He directs the actions of we who follow Tyr. I can't allow access to anyone except those he has sent.~
@6 = ~T-thank you for leaving. This has been a difficult time for the Tyrran faith. I wish I was back in the Hall of Justice.~
@7 = ~I-I'm sorry, but you really shouldn't be in here. I'm waiting for word from Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar.~
@8 = ~I have a letter from Oleff. He sent me.~
@9 = ~Thank goodness you are here. The plague has not been kind to our number... but the work of Tyr must still be done.~
@10 = ~What can you tell me about these tombs?~
@11 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@12 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@13 = ~NP: I'm sorry, but I don't see any letter. Maybe you lost it. In any case, I can't do anything for you without Oleff's written permission.~ /*There does not appear to be any way to open this gate...and the use of force seems to do nothing.*/
@14 = ~NP: In this grave lies Miaslasnia Fairblade. She's been here a long time, though I can't tell you exactly how long. She was a loyal friend of Halueth Neverwinter, so this place may tell us where the founding father himself is buried. It's very close to the surface, meaning it's been moved at least once in Neverwinter's history, but there's no record of it.~ /*This one is very close to the surface, suggesting it may have been moved at least once in Neverwinter history, but no records tell of it.*/
@15 = ~What have you learned from this tomb?~
@16 = ~Where are the other tombs located?~
@17 = ~Did you find any artifacts in here?~
@18 = ~I have other questions.~
@19 = ~The Wailing has taken many, including my brethren that were digging here. Pity... they didn't have time to... well, I shouldn't speak of that.~
@20 = ~What a good looker like yous got to hide, hmm?~
@21 = ~NP: I've been guarding this, uh. hole for days now. All I hear is shuffling feet upstairs and screaming in my head. I'm sorry, but I haven't heard of any strangers or strange company. Personally, that would explain it all to me. All I can do now is sit back and hope I haven't gotten infected myself. I must trust in Tyr's wisdom.~ /*I'm sorry, I wish I knew of mysterious strangers or odd groups. It would put my mind at ease, and give reason to all of this.*/
@22 = ~NP: See you later. Look for Jacob's journal in the trunk. He may have left some important information in there before he, uh. you know. His blessed quill was used for good - writing down everything they found... That's odd... The quill isn't here.~ /*Another time. Remember to look at Jacob's journal in the chest. He may have included some valuable information before he... well.*/

@24 = ~NP: The plague killed everyone involved in the excavation. They took all their knowledge to the grave. There was a diary, though. Jacob the scribe was supposed to record what they found, but I haven't read his reports. It's in the chest. You can open it.~ /*The scribe Jacob was supposed to detail what they found, but I have not read his account. It is in the chest. You may open it.*/
@25 = ~NP: I don't know. Maybe it's in Jacob's journal, but I wasn't allowed to read it. Read it yourself, it's in the trunk. I hope this helps. It would be a shame if he died before he could share his knowledge.~ /*I don't know. Jacob's journal in the chest may say, but I was not instructed to read it, so you will have to examine it yourself.*/
@26 = ~NP: I don't think so. Of course, I didn't arrive until after everyone had died of the plague. I hope no one was shameless enough to disturb their bodies. There may be useful information in the diary, but I wasn't allowed to read it. It's in the chest.~ /*I don't think so. Of course, I only arrived after the team died of the plague. I hope no one had the gall to disturb their bodies.*/
@27 = ~I will answer what I can.~
@28 = ~NP: I don't want to speak ill of them, but the transgression was not that serious. They sinned a little. They-- Well, they began to doubt Tyr's power. I guess these are the times when faith is tested. They somehow contacted the Helmites and got a blessing. There are many gods, I know, and Tyr has always favored Helm, but it's still not good. Again, it's a minor sin. They did nothing wrong, and did their duty to the end.~ /*They consorted somewhat with the Helmites and accepted blessings. There are many gods, I know, and Tyr favors Helm well enough, but it didn't seem appropriate.*/
@29 = ~NP: It's a shame they'll never be absolved of that sin..... But, uh. It's not really your concern. They've left this world, and you have plenty to do.~ /*But... this does not really concern you. They have departed this mortal realm, and you have other duties to attend to.*/
@30 = ~Please, do not touch that. I've been instructed to only allow access to someone sent by Oleff.~
@31 = ~NP: Thank heavens you're here. I can leave my post now, farewell.~ /*Me got hair. You die now, bye-bye.*/
