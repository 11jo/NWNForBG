@0 = ~Welcome to the Alliance Arms Inn. It is a pleasure to serve a hero at my humble establishment. Is there anything I can get for you, <SIRMAAM>?~
@1 = ~What do you charge for a room?~
@2 = ~I'm here to collect the new tavern tax.~
@3 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye, I'll go.~
@5 = ~Only 5 gold pieces for a quality room. I assure you, it will be a peaceful sleep after a hard day.~
@6 = ~That'll do.~
@7 = ~I already paid that tax to another person, so just forget about it. Now what do you want.~
@8 = ~A tax on taverns? That's outrageous! Lord Nasher must be out of his mind. Forget it, I'll never pay.~
@9 = ~Calm down man, it was only a joke.~
@10 = ~[Lie] You'll pay, or this tavern will be shut down on the orders of Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher.~
@11 = ~(sigh) Just don't waste too much of my time. I am very busy, <SIRMAAM>.~
@12 = ~Has there been anything odd going on around here?~
@13 = ~Do you know where I might find some work in town?~
@14 = ~Can you give me directions?~
@15 = ~It's all right, I'll go.~ 
@16 = ~Feel free to spend lots of money here at the Alliance Arms Inn, where paying customers are always welcome.~
@17 = ~A joke? You can't even begin to know how not funny that kind of joke is to an innkeep. Well... no harm done... I suppose. What can I do for you?~
@18 = ~Fine, here's 50 gold. It's a real shame when a ruler thinks he can just tax his subjects for every little thing. Now what do you want?~ 
@19 = ~Lady Aribeth wants to come down here and ask for more taxes in person, then I'll talk to her. What else did ye need?~ 
@20 = ~There has been trouble throughout the north this past while. Between plagues and werewolves a man can hardly step foot outside his inn.~
@21 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@22 = ~But the plague is over, why dwell on the past?~
@23 = ~Werewolves? Where did you hear about werewolves?~
@24 = ~Well, that doesn't interest me. Can I ask you some other questions?~
@25 = ~Some work for an adventurous soul? Well there is that elf over there. He calls himself "The Serpent" and has been inquiring about adventurers for a couple of days. I'm not sure what he wants, but it might be worth your while to check it out. He certainly seems to have no lack of gold.~ 
@26 = ~I will do that. Goodbye.~
@27 = ~I might, but first I have another question.~
@28 = ~If you really need to know, I suppose.~
@29 = ~Where can I find some supplies?~
@30 = ~Why this place called Port Llast? You have docks here?~
@31 = ~I'll bet a cup of wine would help you come up with more questions. Give it some thought.~
@32 = ~It's over, of course, but I don't know that the effects have entirely passed. Looters and bandits are always a problem, but nature also seems to feel the repercussions of something that severe.~
@33 = ~Nature? What do you mean?~
@34 = ~Why don't we get back to more interesting topics?~
@35 = ~It may be over, but there are some who suggest that the effects might be more wide-spread than just making people sick. Nature itself is still feeling the effects.~ 
@36 = ~It's all they're talking about in here. Some knight came along and convinced some boys to go hunting werewolves, but then it turned out... Actually it would probably be better to get the information first-hand. Ander is a survivor of the whole thing. He's in here now and he can tell the tale better than I can.~ 
@37 = ~Well, I suppose I will go talk to Ander then. Goodbye.~ 
@38 = ~Is there anyone else I should talk to about the werewolves?~
@39 = ~Maybe I should talk to him, but first could you answer another question?~
@40 = ~For normal supplies I would suggest the Cracked Anvil in the center of the town. And there is Alhelor, he has some special equipment to sell to werewolf hunters.~ 
@41 = ~Could you answer another question?~
@42 = ~That's all I need thank you.~
@43 = ~Yes <SIRMAAM>. The docks are located just west of here. They are fairly safe, at least as safe as things can be in these times.~
@44 = ~What do you mean?~
@45 = ~All right. I have a few more questions for you.~
@46 = ~I've been hearing about strange things from Neverwinter Wood. Of course that might just be completely unrelated. It's just that there is this ranger, Ballard, who was talking about it here the other day. He seemed to be quite disturbed. If you want to know more I would ask Ballard. He's camped in a grove of trees to the north east of the inn.~ 
@47 = ~All right, I will do that. Goodbye.~
@48 = ~Okay, but first I would like to ask you another question.~
@49 = ~Don't forget, the Alliance Arms Inn has one of the best selections of imported ale this side of Waterdeep.~
@50 = ~Well, there is Alhelor. He seems to know a lot about werewolves. He also has some special equipment to sell to werewolf hunters. You could talk to him, I suppose. Although... no, nevermind.~
@51 = ~What? You can tell me. I won't repeat anything, I swear.~
@52 = ~One can never feel truly safe when there are werewolves running around.~
@53 = ~I don't suppose so. Could you answer another question?~
@54 = ~Well, I hate to say anything, but there is something a little odd about Alhelor. He just puts me on edge. I doubt it is anything serious. Just my nerves I suspect.~
@55 = ~I suspect you are overly paranoid. I'd better talk to Alhelor now.~ 
@56 = ~That's interesting. Maybe I could ask you a few more questions?~
@57 = ~No. I refuse to gossip about a customer. Talk to him and see for yourself.~
@58 = ~I guess I'll go talk to them.~
