@0 = ~So you hunt da Head Gaoler, yuh? You know what you face?~ [KURDAN52]
@1 = ~Just a man like any other, maybe driven mad by the plague.~
@2 = ~I'm hoping it's one of the Waterdhavian creatures, actually.~
@3 = ~Who are you and why are you helping the Head Gaoler?~
@4 = ~You're not even worth my time. Die, grunt!~
@5 = ~The Wailing? No. Head Gaoler, he no man anymore, just a shell of a man. On the inside, something eat his brain. It sees through his eyes, and makes him... different.~
@6 = ~What proof do you have of this?~
@7 = ~What's inside him, then? Have you seen it?~
@8 = ~All right, you stay here. I'm going after the Head Gaoler.~
@9 = ~MT: Хррр, я про это ничего не знаю. Знаю только, что он не человек, просто скорлупа. Что-то ест его мозг изнутри, смотрит его глазами и делает его другим.~ /*Hrrr, I not know much 'bout that. All I know is that he not a man, just a shell of a man.*/
@10 = ~I Kurdan Fenkt. I was king of the Pits, 'till Head Gaoler come down here. Now he king of the Pits and I is just his lackey. Hrrr...~
@11 = ~You let the Head Gaoler walk all over you? How come?~
@12 = ~You were king of nothing - there's nothing here.~
@13 = ~The Head Gaoler's just sick with the Wailing, that's all.~
@14 = ~Hrrr. Then you ain't worth my surrender. If I die, I die as king of da Pits, then. Come on!~
@15 = ~Why he set prisoners free? Why he make guards into zombies? Why he trust me to watch that back of his? Why? Because he ain't Alaefin anymore.~
@16 = ~Guards into zombies? What are you talking about?~
@17 = ~Yeah, I seen it. It's small like a dog and smells like dead moss. No head, just a big brain all open. That must be why it likes eating them so much.~
@18 = ~Sounds like the Waterdhavian Intellect Devourer Aribeth needs.~
@19 = ~MT: Хрр, я здесь не останусь. Если главный надзиратель убьет вас, он поймет, что я сдался вам, и съест за это мой мозг. Я не хочу. Вам надо сразиться с ним. И поговорить со стражниками, чтобы они ушли, и мозгоед не смог перепрыгнуть в них. Да, сделайте это. А я убираюсь отсюда.~ /*You go fight him. Maybe talk to his guards too, so they leave and brain thing not jump in them. Yeah, you do that. I get out of here.*/
@20 = ~He have power to turn folk into zombies. He do it to guards, even. He threaten to do it to me, too.~
@21 = ~Da Pits is what you make of it. Better to be king of Pits den not be any king at all... How many kings you know, anyway?~
@22 = ~You meet them soon enough. They down in his lair, protectin' him. Feedin' him. He say he make me like them if I not serve him...~
@23 = ~How horrible. Is there any way to rescue them?~
@24 = ~I not know about that stuff. I just know that Head Gaoler was tough, and if brain creature can get him, then it's stronger than him, so it's really dangerous...~
@25 = ~MT: Ха! Может, вы сможете им втолковать. Поговорите с ними, и тогда не будет места, куда эта тварь сможет перебраться. Она очень быстро вселяется в людей. Да, может и так. Поговорите с людьми, пусть они уйдут. А еще лучше убить эту тварь внутри главного надзирателя, да побыстрее.~ /*Ha! Maybe you can talk sense into them. Talk to them all and maybe there be no place for brain creature to jump to. It gets into new people real fast.*/
