@0 = ~Who are you? One of the city guard, I suppose. What do you say, <SIRMAAM>? Don't you think Meldanen should be forced to stop his hoarding and give up his stores? It is, after all, the duty of the people to watch over their own. What say you?~ [NWFORMO1] 
@1 = ~Who is this Meldanen?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~You don't know about Meldanen? Well, you must not be from around here, that's for certain. Meldanen is a vicious and evil little man. He does whatever he pleases in Blacklake because he has two things: magic and power. He kidnaps people for his experiments and has all sorts of magical abominations in his estate, and all the other nobles pretend not to notice.~ 
@4 = ~My name is Formosa Laitannen, daughter of a noble house. I may be shut in behind these walls along with the rest of the nobility, but that doesn't mean I think we don't have a responsibility to the city! There are people starving out there. I would help them if I had food to offer, but only Meldanen has it... and having his hoard taken and given to the sick is the very least that Meldanen should suffer!~ 
@5 = ~And you should die... or, at least, Meldanen thinks so.~
@6 = ~Well, I won't and I'm not intimidated by him. His merchant house has been hoarding food and goods for years in this district, and he should give it up whether he likes it or not!~
@7 = ~And who are you, then?~
@8 = ~How do you know there's an actual hoard?~
@9 = ~I agree with you, totally.~
@10 = ~No, I don't agree with you.~
@11 = ~Leave me out of it, I say.~
@12 = ~Regardless, I think you're making trouble and you should stop.~
@13 = ~Goodbye.~
@14 = ~So Meldanen finally takes action against me, does he? Well, I won't fall that easily! You're a fool to do his bidding!!~

@16 = ~You talk like that's in question. Meldanen has never denied that fact, and everyone in Blacklake knows that it's true. He keeps a warehouse near here, locked up so tight with spells and wards there's no hope of access without the proper key. Otherwise the city would have stormed it long ago, I'm sure.~ 
@17 = ~Well that's good to hear. There's few enough people around here with some courage to know what's right and say it out loud. The only question that remains is what's to be done about it. The city guard have their hands full just keeping order... and the chance of me stirring up these frightened pigeons to act is not good.~ 
@18 = ~Of course not. It's Meldanen's property, and he can do with it as he pleases, right? Or is it that we shouldn't convict a man without a trial? Or maybe you're a coward just like everyone else in Blacklake, afraid to give Meldanen what he deserves while helping the people who really need it. Or maybe you just don't care. You don't live here, correct? I do, and these are my people dying.~ 
@19 = ~Leave you out of it. Everybody wants to be left out of it, it seems. Well, once the plague comes knocking on your doorstep, you won't want to be left out of it then!~
@20 = ~I should stop, should I? I should stop caring about the people beyond this wall? I should stop caring that there's a monster in our midst? Well I won't stop. You can't make me, <SIRMAAM>, and I spit at you for even suggesting it. Has everyone in the world gone mad?~ 
@21 = ~I'd expect as much. Go on, then. Cower with the others.~
@22 = ~Everyone's too frightened of Meldanen to do anything about it, however. So much easier to sit behind these walls and pretend there's no plague at all.~
@23 = ~Something drastic needs to be done, and it needs to be done by those that have the ability and the conviction. Like you, <SIRMAAM>. Will you help me?~
@24 = ~What, exactly, do you have in mind?~
@25 = ~No, I have other obligations.~
@26 = ~Forget it!~
@27 = ~That depends. Are you averse to performing a task that some would consider... underhanded?~
@28 = ~Just how underhanded are we talking, here?~
@29 = ~I have no problem with anything of that sort.~
@30 = ~With the right reward, nothing bothers me.~
@31 = ~I wouldn't perform a task of that nature, no.~
@32 = ~Bah! I would have hoped for something more from someone with elven blood. Why, I don't know. What do you want with me, then, <SIRMAAM>?~
@33 = ~To kill you, obviously. Meldanen sends his regards.~ 
@34 = ~I just want you to stop making trouble.~
@35 = ~No need to get angry. I'll help you if I can.~
@36 = ~I'm investigating the plague, and I have some questions.~
@37 = ~I'm looking for work, actually.~
@38 = ~Bah! What's the point? What do you want with me, then, <RACE> creature? Did you come to mock me with these others?~
@39 = ~I am speaking of killing Meldanen, and taking from him the key to his warehouse.~
@40 = ~You will kill him or I will?~
@41 = ~Very well. I will do as you suggest.~
@42 = ~Perhaps you are right... so long as the reward is.~
@43 = ~I will steal the key, but I will not murder a man.~
@44 = ~No. I won't do it.~
@45 = ~You must acquire Meldanen's key, then, that allows access to his hoard. And Meldanen, himself, must be killed so no one need fear retribution from the monster. Meldanen lives in a walled mansion in the northwest corner of Blacklake. His gate is guarded well and there are other wards, but somehow you must gain entry. I do not expect you to do this without reward, of course. Bring me the key and I will give you a magic necklace. For the sorcerer's silver tooth, I offer you 500 gold pieces.~
@46 = ~No? You wouldn't steal a key that will give the city access to sorely-needed food for victims of the plague? You wouldn't kill a monstrous sorcerer that surely deserves his fate? I do not treat what I am asking you as a trivial thing, <SIRMAAM>. But it is right and necessary, all the same.~ 
@47 = ~Why don't you kill him, then?~ 
@48 = ~I won't stop doing what I think is right, my <LADYLORD>. Do whatever you think you have to, and so will I.~ 
@49 = ~I'm not here to answer questions, but if it's the plague you're interested in, have you thought of investigating Meldanen? I've heard about those creatures from Waterdeep. It's entirely possible the sorcerer might have something to do with that, you know. He collects the oddest things and creates abominations. If you're interested in doing what's right, why don't you help me? You may be helping yourself at the same time. What do you say?~ 
@50 = ~No, I don't trust you.~
@51 = ~Hah! Forget it.~
@52 = ~You are, are you? I can give you work, <SIRMAAM>. Help me and I'll reward you, how does that sound?~
@53 = ~As you wish. I suspect, however, that you will quickly change your mind once you discover the true nature of this man. The key that allows access to his hoard is what is important, however. Bring me that. Should you happen to change your mind and give Meldanen his due, I'll not argue.~ 
@54 = ~That is all I can offer you... and it is a fair price for the service you will render.~
@55 = ~I see Meldanen was right. Time for you to die, Formosa.~
@56 = ~Very well. I'll do it.~
@57 = ~I've changed my mind. This doesn't interest me.~
@58 = ~I am no killer, <SIRMAAM>. If I were, I would have challenged the sorcerer long ago, and all this would be unnecessary.~
@59 = ~Meldanen lives in a fenced mansion, its gates are well guarded. There are other defenses, but you have to get in somehow. I do not expect you to do this without reward, of course. Bring me the key and I will give you a magic necklace. For the sorcerer's silver tooth, I'll give you 1,000 gold coins.~
@60 = ~Thank the gods that you came, then. Maybe some good can finally come out of all this. I look forward to your return.~

@62 = ~You change your mind now? Fine, then. Go and leave me to do what needs to be done.~
@63 = ~So you're back, are you? Have you changed your mind, my <LADYLORD>? Will you help me get the key and end Meldanen's life?~ [NWFORMO3]
@64 = ~No, I'm here to kill you, instead. Meldanen sends his regards.~
@65 = ~So you have returned, my <LADYLORD>. Do you have news?~ [NWFORMO4]
@66 = ~I have the key for Meldanen's warehouse.~
@67 = ~I have Meldanen's silver tooth, taken from his head.~
@68 = ~I have Meldanen's tooth and the key to Meldanen's warehouse.~
@69 = ~Meldanen is dead, but I don't have his tooth. You can trust me.~
@70 = ~Not yet, but I'm working on it.~
@71 = ~I bring a gift from Meldanen, actually: your death!~
@72 = ~Allow me to see it. Yes... this is the one, I can detect the counterspells on it. Bless you, <SIRMAAM>, the city will be thanking the gods for you in the days to come. What of Meldanen, himself? What happened with the sorcerer?~ 
@73 = ~He is dead, but I don't have his tooth.~
@74 = ~He lives, though not for long.~
@75 = ~He lives, and I do not intend to kill him.~
@76 = ~The tooth... yes, that looks to be the one. I understand Meldanen took power from it and would not part with it willingly. So he is, indeed, dead. I am relieved. Far more important is the key, however. Do you have it?~ 
@77 = ~No, not yet.~
@78 = ~No, and I don't intend to retrieve it, either.~
@79 = ~Allow me to see it. Yes... this is the one, I can detect the counterspells on it. Bless you, <SIRMAAM>, the city will be thanking the gods for you in the days to come. The tooth... yes, that looks to be the one. I understand Meldanen took power from it and would not part with it willingly. So he is, indeed, dead. It will be a relief. Lead on.~ 
@80 = ~You shall have to forgive me, <SIRMAAM>, if I insist on seeing the sorcerer's tooth before I believe that he is truly dead. What you think was the sorcerer might have been an illusion or a simulacrum. Meldanen is cunning, I have little doubt. I am sorry, but I need to see the tooth before I reward you for the deed.~ 
@81 = ~Move swiftly, my <LADYLORD>. The longer you delay the more people suffer.~ 
@82 = ~If I am to reward you, I need proof of the sorcerer's death. You may have slain a simulacrum or an illusion... I cannot be sure, otherwise. If you wish, <SIRMAAM>, keep the key and return with the sorcerer's tooth. Then I shall reward you for both.~ 
@83 = ~Very well. I will return with the tooth.~
@84 = ~Forget it. I just don't want any part of it.~ 
@85 = ~If you wish, <SIRMAAM>, keep the key and return with the sorcerer's tooth. Then I shall reward you for both.~
@86 = ~As you wish, <SIRMAAM>. The people may fear Meldanen's retribution and fear to enter the warehouse... hopefully I can change their mind. As promised, here is the necklace. I know it is not much, but hopefully it will suffice.~
@87 = ~This was pretty risky. Couldn't you give a bit more gold?~
@88 = ~No. Give me more or I'll see what *your* teeth are worth.~
@89 = ~The reward will do nicely.~
@90 = ~I was glad to help. The reward is not necessary.~
@91 = ~Not really. I'd rather take it all off your dead body.~
@92 = ~Then I suggest you get it. While I am relieved to hear that Meldanen is dead, his death pales in importance next to retrieving that key.~
@93 = ~Then I shall get it.~
@94 = ~All right, but I want my reward for the tooth now.~
@95 = ~What?! The whole purpose of this was to retrieve the warehouse key! Meldanen's death pales in importance next to it!~
@96 = ~You have retrieved the key and slain the monster in his home. I am in debt to you, <SIRMAAM>. I hope what little reward I have to offer will suffice. As promised, I will give you the necklace and 1000 gold pieces. I know it isn't much, but I hope you can take satisfaction in knowing you have helped so many.~ 
@97 = ~I was glad to help, but I don't want a reward for killing someone.~
@98 = ~I... have a little more. It is true, however, you do deserve it. 1350 gold pieces, then, but I have no more to give.~
@99 = ~Yes, that will do nicely.~
@100 = ~I have nothing more to offer you, my <LADYLORD>, except my gratitude.~ 
@101 = ~I see. Threats, is it? This is how you respond to a reward, well-intended? Or do you simply look on this as some form of back-alley bargaining? Regardless, I won't stand for it. I offered you a reward for your good service and I would hope that you'd accept it gracefully.~ 
@102 = ~Hah! Time for you to die, I guess!~
@103 = ~Fine. Hand it over, then.~
@104 = ~Then here it is. Thank you again. You have helped far more than I thought anyone would. Now I must go and collect others to enter the warehouse. Farewell, my <LADYLORD>.~ 

@106 = ~You are very generous. Take the necklace, regardless... I will not see you completely unrewarded, despite what you say. You have helped far more than I thought anyone would. Now I must go and collect others to enter the warehouse. Farewell, my <LADYLORD>.~ 
@107 = ~Treacherous fool! I'll fight you if I must!!~
@108 = ~I am relieved to hear it. I shall await your return.~
@109 = ~I suppose you're right. Here you are-- 250 gold pieces. You have helped far more than I thought anyone would. Now I must go and collect others to enter the warehouse. Farewell, my <LADYLORD>.~ 

@111 = ~I have nothing more to offer you than my gratitude. You have helped far more than I thought anyone would. Now I must go and collect others to enter the warehouse. Farewell, my <LADYLORD>.~ 
@112 = ~You are very generous. Take the necklace, regardless... I will not see you completely unrewarded, despite what you say. You have helped far more than I thought anyone would. Now I must go and collect others to enter the warehouse. Farewell, my <LADYLORD>.~ 
@113 = ~You shall get the reward when I have the key. No sooner. It is what is truly important, here.~
@114 = ~Fine. Then I shall get it for you.~
@115 = ~Then I'll take my reward from your dead body!~
@116 = ~This is an outrage! I shall fight you, blackguard!~
@117 = ~Thank you for your assistance.~ [NWFORMO5]
