@0 = ~NP: **hiccup** Hey, I d-know you! You are one of those who are hired by the x-heroic Gends to find the Words of Power, yes! **hiccup** H-k-no, it is. You must help me. This waitress wants to kick me out! She says I'll drink! Shaw me so impossible! I'm Lillian Cambridgedj! Aarin Gend needs help to find the shlov of power!~ [LILLIAN54] /*You hash to help me. That waitressh cut me off! She shays I'm drunk! She can't treat me like thish! I'm Lillian Cambridge! Aarin Gend wantsh my help to find them Wordsh of Power!*/
@1 = ~I think you've had enough to drink, Lillian.~
@2 = ~Maybe I should get you another drink so you'll pass out and quit your drunken babbling.~
@3 = ~What can you tell me about the Words of Power?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~You can't talk to me like thish! I'm not shome drunk - I'm a reshpected arche... archeolo... I'm a reshpected exshpert in my field!~
@6 = ~NP: I already had one of these shlovs of power, you know. It was inside this pretty pug ball. *hic* But now some hero came and pulled him out of there, and in a puff ball, puffy - puffy and lonely. I need to drink just a glass to cheer up! *hic* If you see the innkeeper, tell him to bring another bottle. This one is already fluffy.~ /*I used to have one of them Wordsh  of Power, you know. It was inshide thish pretty shnow globe. *hic* But now shome hero went and got it out, and shnow globe is empty - empty and all alone.*/
@7 = ~I need another drink to get my shpirits up! *hic* If you shee the bartender tell him to bring me another bottle. Thish one's almosht empty.~
@8 = ~NP: **hiccup** Hey, I d-know you! You are one of those who are hired by the x-heroic Gends to find the Words of Power, yes! **hiccup** H-k-no, it is. You really should t-try the wine here. The first couple of bottles go so-so, but then ... uhhhhh!~ [LILLIAN54] /***hic** Hey, I know you! You're one of them herosshh Gend hired to find them Words of Power, right! **hic** Shhure, that's you.*/
@9 = ~You're drunk!~
@10 = ~I am not drunk! *giggle* I am Lillian Cambridge, archeologisht eshtrodinaire! Gend wantsh me to help you herosh find them Words of Power. Go ahead, ashk me a queshtion.~
@11 = ~I need to find the Words of Power.~
@12 = ~I'll be going now.~
@13 = ~You should go inshide my shnow globe. There's one of them Words of Power in there. At leasht, there used to be.~
@14 = ~What are you talking about?~
@15 = ~Off you goes then. If you see the bartender, be a doll and tell him my glassh ish almost empty. Thanks, love.~
@16 = ~NP: Ff room. Right at the top. F-th door to the left. Sh-shnezhnaya sphere there. on a pydesh-shtalchik. There is a wonderful little world inside. *hee hee hic * A whole tiny little world is right inside this sh-shnezh sphere, and the Word of Power, by the way, is also there.~ /*Inshide is a tiny little world. *giggle* A whole tiny world inshide that shnow globe, and the Word of Power is inshide, too.*/
@17 = ~How do I get into the snow globe?~
@18 = ~NP: Just get up and touch the snow sphere. PFFF! And you are inside! Just don't expect me to come to the rescue if you get into trouble. It's way too dangerous. I'd rather hang out here and drink some wine.~ /*Just go up an touch the shnow globe. POOF! You're inshide! Jusht don't expect me to come shave you if you get into trouble.*/
@19 = ~About time you showed up. I've been waiting at least ten minutes for someone to come by and refill my drink!~ [LILLIAN57]
@20 = ~NP: I'm not here to serve booze. I work for Aarin Gend.~ /*I'm not here to fill your drink. I'm <CHARNAME>. I work for Aarin Gend.*/
@21 = ~I was hoping you could tell me something about this snow globe.~
@22 = ~NP: Oh yes.<CHARNAME> , the hero of Neverwinter. I would raise a glass to your legendary exploits if my glass weren't empty. My name is Lillian Cambridge, an archaeologist. I am the North's leading specialist in antiques and ancient artifacts. Without a doubt, Aarin Gend told me that I had come to offer my unique knowledge to the Lords' Alliance.~ /*My name is Lillian Cambridge, archeologist. I'm the North's leading expert in antiquities and ancient artifacts. No doubt Aarin Gend has told you that I've come to offer my rather unique knowledge to aid the cause of the Lords' Alliance.*/
@23 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@24 = ~NP: Snow sphere? This is some kind of artifact, which some time ago was stolen from me by a rather nice magician named Nux. Can you get my lost treasure back? Give it to me<CHARNAME> . I need to make sure it's the same snow sphere that was stolen from me.~ /*A snow globe? There was just such an item stolen from me some time ago by a rather charming mage named Nax. Is it possible you have recovered my missing treasure?*/
@25 = ~Tell me where I can find the snow globe again.~
@26 = ~I've got the snow globe right here.~
@27 = ~That is why I'm here: to answer your questions about the Words of Power and the Creator Race that constructed them... And to sample the local wines, of course.~
@28 = ~Where can I find the Words of Power?~
@29 = ~Tell me about the Creator Race.~
@30 = ~How did you end up here in Beorunna's Well?~
@31 = ~I need some directions.~
@32 = ~Let me see it, <CHARNAME>. I must examine it to be certain this is the snow globe that was stolen from me.~
@33 = ~Hold on, what about a reward?~
@34 = ~Here, take the snow globe.~
@35 = ~NP: If it was all about drawing you a map<CHARNAME> , I would have told Aarin Gend everything I know a long time ago. You remember that the Words are thousands and thousands of years old. The Shaper race that created the words was older than even the first Elven Kingdoms. Everything I know about them is just theory and conjecture based on myths and legends.~ /*If it were as simple as drawing you a map, <CHARNAME>, I'd have told Aarin Gend everything I know. You have to remember that the Words are thousands and thousands of years old.*/
@36 = ~Surely you must know something.~
@37 = ~Some expert you turned out to be.~
@38 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@39 = ~NP: The Creators were like modern lizardmen, but they were more intelligent and powerful than any of the hominids that exist today. Little we know about them, except that they were a cruel and ruthless empire that destroyed or enslaved any other race that got in their way.~ /*Little is known about them, save that they were a cruel and ruthless empire, slaughtering or enslaving the other races whenever they came across them.*/
@40 = ~NP: Many strange and exotic artifacts are found in the north, and I myself have spent a long time in the archaeological digs in this area. Mounds, crypts, sarcophagi... It's amazing what treasures you can dig up there!~ /*There are many strange and exotic artifacts scattered throughout the north, and I spend much of my time in and around this area on archeological digs.*/
@41 = ~You're nothing more than a common grave robber!~
@42 = ~But how did you end up working for Aarin Gend?~
@43 = ~NP: I'm afraid I can't help you. Since I came to Beorunn's Well, I have stayed almost all the time in this hotel. I have a clean and comfortable room here, and the local wine is quite pleasant after a couple of first glasses. Besides, I don't think it's that hard to find anything here. So, is there anything else I can help you with?~ /*I'm afraid I can't help you there. Since I've arrived at Beorunna's Well I've hardly left this inn. My room is clean and comfortable, and the wine here is quite palatable, after the first few glasses.*/
@44 = ~A reward? Yes, of course. Give me the snow globe and I will tell you where to find one of the Words of Power. But first I must verify that this snow globe is truly the one I seek.~
@45 = ~This snow globe is pretty valuable to you. I think you could spare some coin for its return.~
@46 = ~Let me see... yes, this is it! The snow globe Nax stole from me! Well done, <CHARNAME>! Now, to put it somewhere safe. (She mutters something and the globe vanishes.)~
@47 = ~It's gone!~
@48 = ~NP: I can tell you that several Words of Power were created, but they are scattered throughout the North and their trace has been lost for many thousands of years. All that's left are rumors about the places where they disappeared. Some say that the Words were stolen by dragons that live in the mountains to the west. Others claim they can be found in the desert, in ancient ruins far south of Fort Ilkard, or perhaps hidden in the forests to the north.~ /*Some believe the Words were taken by the dragons who dwell in the mountains to the west. Others claim clues to their location may be found in the long deserted ruins far to the south of Fort Ilkard, or hidden in the forests to the north.*/
@49 = ~What became of the Creators I cannot say. For centuries they ruled this land and then suddenly they vanished, leaving virtually no evidence they had ever existed at all.~
@50 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>! The term grave robber has such unsavory connotations. I prefer to think of myself as a tomb raider, if you will.~
@51 = ~When I heard Aarin Gend was seeking the Words of Power I came to offer my expertise in this area. Gend has a reputation for rewarding his allies well.~
@52 = ~Maybe it's just the wine talking, but I like you. I suppose I could afford to spare a small monetary reward for the recovery of my snow globe. How does 300 gold pieces sound?~
@53 = ~Deal.~
@54 = ~Forget it.~
@55 = ~NP: I'm sorry<CHARNAME> , but by law, the snow sphere is mine. I'm not going to pay for my own thing. Besides, I know how much Aarin Gend needs Words of Power. And if you want to get them for him, you'll have to get me a snow sphere.~ /*Besides, I know how badly Aarin Gend desires the Words of Power. If you want to recover it for him you will give me the snow globe.*/
@56 = ~NP: Don't be afraid,<CHARNAME> . I simply teleported the snow sphere to a special pedestal in my room here at this hotel using the word of command. If I'd done it before, Nux wouldn't have been able to steal it from me. Looks like I'm a little... tipsy. The wine was a little stronger than I t-thought.~ /*Never fear, <CHARNAME>. I have merely transitioned the snow globe to its pedestal in my room here at the inn using the command word. Had I done this before, Nax could not have stolen it from me.*/
@57 = ~NP: But like I told you before<CHARNAME> , I know where one of the Words of Power is located, and I'll be happy to share this information with you if you take my snow sphere from Nax. Is there anything else I can help you with?~ /*But, as I've already told you, <CHARNAME>, I know the location of one of the Words of Power, and I will be happy to share this information with you as soon as you get my snow globe back from Nax.*/
@58 = ~I don't have time to look for your snow globe. I need to find the Words of Power right now!~
@59 = ~The truth is they could be anywhere... though I believe I have learned the location of one of the Words, after many years of research and study.~
@60 = ~Where can I find this Word?~
@61 = ~And of course I was interested in recruiting someone to recover my snow globe from Nax, as I have already explained to you.~
@62 = ~And I was also hoping to find some brave adventurer, some intrepid, would-be hero, who might aid me in a little task.~
@63 = ~Task? What kind of task?~
@64 = ~NP: As you wish,<CHARNAME> . In any case, I doubt that the snow sphere you found is the one I need. If so, I'll wait here until you recover. Remember, until I get the snow sphere, you won't know how to find the Word of Power.~ /*As you wish, <CHARNAME>. I doubt the snow globe you have is the one I need, anyway.*/
@65 = ~Now, as I promised I will tell you how to find the Word of Power. The key, as you may have already guessed, is the snow globe itself.~

@67 = ~NP: I don't think you have any idea how important this particular snow sphere is,<CHARNAME> . There is such power hidden in this glass sphere, power that we cannot even imagine! Nax felt this power, even if he did not understand it himself. That's why he stole that snow sphere from me. But he will never know her secrets. It took me many years just to lift the veil over the secrets of the snow sphere.~ /*Nax felt its power, even if he didn't understand it. That's why he stole the snow globe from me. But he'll never unlock its mysteries. It took me years of research to uncover the snow globe's secrets.*/
@68 = ~As I told you before, the snow globe was stolen from me by a wizard named Nax. He told me he was going to the Coldwood in search of a long forgotten wizard's laboratory.~
@69 = ~Off you go then. Best of luck in your mission. Come back and see me if you have any more questions. That's what I'm here for, after all.~
@70 = ~NP: Before I tell you where the Word of Power is, I need your help to solve one problem. Not so long ago, a wonderful thing was stolen from me: a snow sphere, which I acquired on behalf of a very wealthy patron. If you want me to tell you everything I know about the location of the Word of Power, you'll have to get that snow orb for me.~ /*Before I tell you the location of the Word of Power I need you to perform a task. Something very precious was stolen from me recently: a snow globe I had acquired on behalf of a very wealthy benefactor.*/
@71 = ~I can't waste my time looking for a snow globe!~
@72 = ~Where can I find the snow globe?~
@73 = ~If you know where one of the Words of Power is, you'd better tell me. I don't want this to get nasty.~
@74 = ~NP: Something was stolen from me. A very rare and wonderful artifact is a snow sphere, which I got on one of the archaeological expeditions for one of my rich patrons. Now, if I could find someone who would help me return the snow sphere, I would be very grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I could even tell you everything I know about the location of one of the Words of Power.~ /*If I could find someone to recover that snow globe for me I would be very grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I might even tell them what I know about the location of one of the Words of Power.*/
@75 = ~NP: Don't be afraid,<CHARNAME> . I simply teleported the snow sphere to a special pedestal in my room here at this hotel using the word of command. If I'd done it before, Nux wouldn't have been able to steal it from me. Looks like I'm a little... tipsy. The wine was a little stronger than I t-thought. Now, as I promised, I will tell you how to find the Word of Power. The key, as you might have guessed, is in the snowy sphere itself.~ /*Never fear, <CHARNAME>. I have merely transitioned the snow globe to its pedestal in my room here at the inn using the command word. Had I done this before, Nax could not have stolen it from me.*/
@76 = ~I have researched the snow globe in great detail, and I've discovered something rather interesting. Within the glass globe there exists an entire miniature world, a real world with real, living creatures!~
@77 = ~A miniature world? How is that possible?~
@78 = ~What does this have to do with the Word of Power?~
@79 = ~But all this is beside the point. If you want me to tell you where the Word of Power can be found, you'll bring me the snow globe. That alone should be incentive enough for you.~
@80 = ~NP: Find me a snow sphere and I'll tell you how to find one of the Words of Power.~ /*Find the snow globe and I'll tell where you can find one of the Words of Power. Now, is there anything else, <CHARNAME>?*/
@81 = ~NP: I was on my way to give the snow orb to my customer when it was stolen from me by an unscrupulous, albeit very handsome, wizard named Nux. From what he told me, I understood that Nux was engaged in some kind of magical research. It was as if he had found a magical entrance to the abandoned laboratory of a long-dead wizard somewhere in the deserts to the north of the Forest of Chill.~ /*From what he told me, Nax was in these parts doing some research of his own. It seems he found a magical entrance to the deserted laboratory of a long dead wizard somewhere in the Coldwood to the north.*/
@82 = ~NP: Deliver me from your threats<CHARNAME> . Aarin Gend personally invited me here. What do you think he will do to you if you try to offend me? Give me back my snow sphere and I'll gladly tell you everything I know about the whereabouts of the Word of Power. However, until I receive the orb, this secret will remain with me.~ /*Bring me my snow globe and I will gladly tell you what I know about the location of the Word of Power. However, until I get the snow globe the secret remains with me.*/
@83 = ~If the ancient texts and documents I have researched are accurate, someone has hidden one of the Words of Power inside the miniature world.~
@84 = ~How can I get the Word out?~
@85 = ~I'll bet Nax is exploring that laboratory right now and with my snow globe at his side! But if you want to go after him you'll need this teleportation scroll. Nax told me it was the only way to pass through the magical portal leading to the dungeon.~
@86 = ~How did you manage to get this teleportation scroll? And why did Nax tell you all this?~
@87 = ~Based on my research, you actually have to go inside the snow globe and retrieve it. There doesn't seem to be any other way to get the Word out.~
@88 = ~Okay, get me in!~
@89 = ~Forget it, it sounds too risky.~
@90 = ~NP: I am a talented and attractive woman, and I see no reason not to use my charm to continue archaeological research. Nux bought me a drink, we had a nice chat about our research, word for word... Then, when Nux fell asleep, I borrowed the scroll and slipped out to make copies before returning the scroll to his bag. I planned to explore this dungeon myself a little later.~ /*I'm a capable and attractive woman, and I'm not above using my charms to further my archeological investigations. Nax offered to buy me a few drinks, we got to talking about our respective research, one thing led to another...*/
@91 = ~NP: The snow sphere is on its pedestal in my room. Up the stairs, second door on the left. If you decide to go inside the sphere, just touch it and you will be inside. Ohhh, how this wine hits the head! Strong stuff! When you go, kick the innkeeper to pour me another drink.~ /*The snow globe is on its pedestal in my room. Second door on the left at the top of the stairs. If you're determined to go inside, all you have to do is touch the globe and will yourself in.*/
@92 = ~NP: Can't say that I blame you. I myself would never dare to climb inside the sphere, even considering the incredible rewards that Gend promises to those who find the Word of Power. I imagined that sooner or later there would be someone who dared to go inside the sphere. And it certainly won't be me. Now that I have my snow sphere back, I want to drink some wine and relax!~ /*I can't say I blame you. I wouldn't want to risk going in there myself, even though Gend is offering a hefty reward to recover those Words of Power.*/
@93 = ~I've changed my mind. Get me inside the snow globe.~
@94 = ~NP: But while I was away to copy the scrolls, Nux stole my snow sphere! I didn't notice until he was gone. It's all my fault that I left him sleeping in my room. I don't hold a grudge against Nux for what he did. I just want the snow sphere back. Give it back to me and I'll tell you where one of the Words of Power is.~ /*But while I was out making copies, Nax took my snow globe! I didn't notice until he was long gone. I guess it's my own fault for leaving him asleep in my room.*/

@96 = ~Whoo, that wine went right to my head! That's strong stuff! On your way out, let the bartender know I'm ready for another round.~
@97 = ~NP: ** Greetings - again,<CHARNAME> . I hope your search for my missing snow sphere is going better than my search for a good glass of wine in this place. It's not that I haven't tried. *hic* Oh, sorry. Looks like I should slow down... I shouldn't have gotten drunk all at once, I guess...~ [LILLIAN56] /*Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. I hope your search for my missing snow globe is going better than my search for a decent glass of wine in this place.*/
