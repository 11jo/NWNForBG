@0 = ~What manner of slave are you, that does not cast down <PRO_HISHER> eyes in my presence! (hiss) I could have you flayed for this!~
@1 = ~Do you not recognize me? I am Morag, First Daughter of the Queen and heir to the throne! (hiss) How dare you approach me?~
@2 = ~I meant no offense, Mistress. I only wanted to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~I bow to no one! I am no slave!~
@4 = ~Die, Morag!~
@5 = ~NP: I could tear out your tongue for daring to speak to me, slave. (hisses) But your boldness and courage amuse me. It is rare to find such a bold slave. I will answer your questions, creature, especially since you will pay for them with your life. (hisses) What do you want to know, slave?~ /*I could have your tongue removed for daring to speak to me, slave. (hiss) But your brazen courage amuses me. It is rare for a slave to show such bravery.*/
@6 = ~What is this place?~
@7 = ~How can we understand each other?~
@8 = ~I want to know more about you, Morag.~
@9 = ~Do you know anything about the Words of Power?~
@10 = ~NP: Your mistress should have your tongue ripped out for such insolence! (hisses) But wait... There's something wrong with you, bitch. Where is your collar? (hisses) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve? Your appearance and clothing are unfamiliar to me. (hisses) You are not a slave! What are you, beast?~ /*There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve?*/
@11 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I have come from the far distant future.~
@12 = ~I'll be the one who asks the questions around here!~
@13 = ~Guards! Protect me from this creature!~
@14 = ~NP: This is the temple of the glory of the Creator Race! (hisses) The might and power of our people will reside within these walls forever! As a slave, you need understand no more. (hisses) It is your mistress' will that you build this temple, and you must bow to that will.~ /*As a slave you need not understand more than that. (hiss) It is the will of your mistresses that you build this temple, and you will bow down to that will.*/
@15 = ~NP: Has your mistress taught you nothing? (hisses) The translator amulet I wear gives you an understanding of my words. (hisses) If it weren't for the amulet, we wouldn't need creatures like you. It is the only way we can make our servants and slaves bow to our will.~ /*(hiss) If not for the amulets we would have no use for your kind. It is the only way we can make our servants and slaves bow down to our orders.*/
@16 = ~NP: I'm not going to discuss my royal persona with a common slave. (hisses) The intrigues and political machinations of the royal court are not for a wretch like you, anyway. Poison planted in his mother's cup, an assassin's blade thrust into his older sister's belly, an ally betrayed by false rumors, an infante strangled by his own sister in his sleep... (hisses) What can a slave like you know of the motives behind such acts?~ /*Poison slipped into a mother's cup, an assassin's blade twisted in the belly of an elder sister, an ally betrayed by a false rumor, an infant sibling smothered in his sleep... (hiss) What could a slave know of the motivation behind such things?*/
@17 = ~NP: How dare you speak the name of one of our most sacred relics? (hisses) I could rip every fiber out of your body for blaspheming the holy Words, slave! I demand an answer as to how you know of the Words of Authority! No slave is allowed to know such things! (hisses) But, wait...~ /*How dare you speak the name of our most sacred relics? (hiss) I could have your entrails torn from your body for profaning the holy Words, slave!*/
@18 = ~My actions transcend mere life and death! I am of royal blood and I seek the immortality of the throne! (hiss) But your life is void of ambition. You are a slave. Your only concern is to bow to the will of your mistress.~
@19 = ~NP: There's something wrong with you, bitch. Where is your collar? (hisses) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve? Your appearance and clothing are unfamiliar to me. (hisses) You are not a slave! What are you, beast?~ /*There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve?*/
@20 = ~NP: Of course there's a time shift! (hisses) this is not the world you know, creature. The secrets of the Creator race are kept here, but you will not have them. Guards! Kill that thing! (hisses) So it can't sneak out of here in time!~ /*Of course, the time sink! (hiss) This is not the world you know, creature. The secrets of the Creator Race are not yours for the taking.*/
@21 = ~You are arrogant, when you should tremble before the terrible power of the Creator Race. (hiss) How can this be? Unless...~
