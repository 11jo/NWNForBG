@7 = ~Desther fortifies here because his role is nearly played out. He is abandoned. He has no bridges left to burn.~ [NWMOR058]
@8 = ~The dead are plentiful, so he surrounds himself with corpses. It won't be enough. His death is ordained and his life is forfeit.~ [NWMOR059]
@9 = ~Who are you? How do you know these things?~
@10 = ~I am grateful. Will you help me find him?~
