@0 = ~注意！我们有了新老板，没什么变动，还是间很棒的酒馆啦！~
@1 = ~我有铁拳竞技场的通行证。~
@2 = ~最近酒馆里有没有什么新鲜事？~
@3 = ~让我们瞧瞧你有什么东西要卖。~
@4 = ~再见，祝你好运。~
@5 = ~嘘！别说的这么大声，钥匙在这里。当你想去的时候往下走，在中心的南面墙上有道门，那里会有楼梯可以通到地下室。~
@6 = ~什么是铁拳竞技场，具体说明一下吧？~
@7 = ~再见。~
@8 = ~你已经拿到钥匙了，如果你想的话就下去参加铁拳竞技场。在中心的南面墙上有道门，那里会有楼梯可以通到地下室。~
@9 = ~没什么值得一提的，什么都没有。~
@10 = ~少来了，这哪有什么，告诉我？~
@11 = ~我并不想要诉诸武力，但是如果你不告诉我的话，我会这么做。~
@12 = ~改天吧，朋友~
@13 = ~它是一种比赛，那些相信没有什么比保护自己，抵御别人对你存心伤害更基本的人们，所举办的公开比赛。 你赢的话，你会得到晋级和少许的欢呼，你输的话，就是一无所有。然后再试一次。这是在战斗之中寻找自身的价值。~ 
@14 = ~为什么这是个大秘密？~
@15 = ~听着，如果你真的要参加这里的活动，你必须先从佣兵公会的一个佣兵那儿拿到通行证，之后我们再谈。~
@16 = ~佣兵公会？那是什么东西？~
@17 = ~不，我不这么认为。这没什么值得你忧虑的。~
@18 = ~嗯，也许你是合适的，不过这不重要。你先去从佣兵公会的一个佣兵那儿拿到通行证。之后我们再谈。~
@19 = ~Look, it ain't exactly safe for people to get in a pit and slug it out. We've had accidents... a couple people lost limbs... You win, you get a rank and a few cheers. You lose, you get dusted off and try again. It's about knowing your worth in a fight.The city guards think it's a bloodsport, but it's not. It's about honor in battle, but they don't understand. The guards just see what they want to.Look, if you want to try, that's up to you. just don't blab about it, and don't complain if you lose. People don't like that.~/*听着，把人聚在个笼子里然后让他们打架，这很明显地不安全。我们曾经出过事……有人断胳臂断腿的…… 你拿了黄金，我要再次试试。 城市卫兵们认为这是种血腥的运动。可是这并不是，这关系战斗的荣耀，不过他们不能了解就是了。守卫们只看那些他们想要看的事情。 听着，如果你想试试看的话，随你便。只是不要泄漏口风，还有如果你输了的话不要抱怨。人们不喜欢这种行为。*/
@20 = ~如果你不知道那是啥的话，我怀疑你还会不会再回来。就是在市中心西北角的佣兵协会。那个就是我在说的东西。~
@21 = ~很高兴见到你，老板。有什么我可以帮你的吗？~
@22 = ~给我看看这个礼拜的收入。~
@23 = ~我有这间酒馆，那我现在应该做什么呢？~

@42 = ~抱歉，<CHARNAME>，但是时间并不充裕到能让我们解决那些订单。还要等一个礼拜那些付款才进来。~ 
@43 = ~嗯，上一任老板，克劳德斯，他让事情上轨道所以他就不用特别做些什么。他总是忙东忙西的。 总而言之，你所需要做的就是每个礼拜来店里一次，然后我会给你看这个礼拜的营收。你不会变有钱啦，不过这总比什么都没有来的好。 此外，我可以辨认出来你是那种喜欢到外头去闯去冒险的人，你看起来就像这种型的。这听起来对我来说有点危险，不过我敢说这一定会有些好处的。~ 
@44 = ~再会。~
