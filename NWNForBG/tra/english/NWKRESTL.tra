@0 = ~Thank the gods it's a friendly face. I sure didn't want to end up like those boys.~
@1 = ~Like who?~
@2 = ~Yes, the plague has taken its toll.~
@3 = ~NP: Well, you're safe now, so calm down.~ /*Well, you're safe now. Quit your crying.*/
@4 = ~NP: &quot;Sword Coast Boys&quot; These undead are a gang... they WERE my gang. I thought they would want to find me, you know? I have nothing to do with them, at least after what happened to Drola's rivals. Now they are all dead, and Drol has turned into some kind of monster!~ /*I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!*/
@5 = ~Who is Drawl? A zombie?~
@6 = ~Who are you to the Sword Coast Boys?~
@7 = ~What happened to Drawl's rivals?~
@8 = ~NP: I wish it was just a plague. &quot;Sword Coast Boys&quot; is even worse. These zombies were once part of my gang. I have nothing to do with them, at least after what happened to Drola's rivals. Now they are all dead, and Drol has turned into some kind of monster!~ /*I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!*/
@9 = ~NP: I'm not safe. They will be back. A coast boy will always be a coast boy... even if he dies. I have nothing to do with them, at least after what happened to Drola's rivals. Now they are all dead, and Drol has turned into some kind of monster!~ /*I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!*/
@10 = ~NP: No, Drol and his lieutenants are even worse. I happened to see them for a second ... they are not clumsy, and even agile ... They look really angry now. He would be the leader of our gang, but I don't know who he's doing business with now. Surely, he threw everyone just to gain power and power.~ /*No way, Drawl and his lieutenants are worse. I saw 'em for a second... they ain't lumbering or slow... They look really evil now.*/
@11 = ~Who did Drawl make a deal with? Who did this?~
@12 = ~I'm leaving. What are you doing now?~
@13 = ~NP: I? I am Crestal. I was one of the &quot;Guys&quot;. I'm lucky that I've been so... geared only a little, and now no one is looking for me. Plague or no plague, I would be dead by now. After what Drol did to the others... and how they tracked down Walters after he left. I hope everything is all right with him... As far as I know, Drol's opponents did not fare well.~ /*After what Drawl did to the others... and how they tracked Walters down after he left. I hope he's all right... I know Drawl's rivals ended bad.*/
@14 = ~Where are they?~
@15 = ~NP: Some of the guys, they were trying to get the gang out of town when the plague hit. Well, you understand, they wanted to save their skins. Drol was in charge and ordered everyone to stay. He said he was going to make a deal that would give the gang great power. He didn't let anyone leave. Then he turned into... into something. Now... everyone is dead... zombies, but different. And Drol, he is still their leader. I don't know how... He has some very powerful friend.~ /*Then he changed into... something. Now... everyone is dead... zombies, but different. And Drawl, he's still leading them. Don't know how... He's got a powerful friend somewhere.*/
@16 = ~How did Drawl do all this?~
@17 = ~NP: I don't know. At first it seemed to me that the &quot;Big Guys&quot; were involved in this. They're a band of half-orcs, but now they've all turned into undead too. They all roam the warehouse. As if Drol deliberately put them on display, like all his rivals ... proving his case.~ /*I don't know. At first I thought The Heavies had something to do with it. They're a gang of half-orcs, but now they are all undead too.*/
@18 = ~I ain't going anywhere! I ain't ending up like them... not even Drawl, if I can help it.~
@19 = ~NP: &quot;Sword Coast Boys&quot;? Drol ordered them to take over the warehouse and make a new base out of it. I don't know why he decided that this particular building was so important. This happened very recently. It is in the north central part of the region.~ /*The Sword Coast Boys? Drawl had them take over a warehouse as a new base. Don't know why he thought that specific building was so important.*/
@20 = ~NP: I'm telling you, someone is supporting him. I don't know. Maybe... maybe it has something to do with the zombies that are everywhere now, and they wanted undead that were still sentient. But I don't know why they needed Drol. He must have been very easy to please. I don't think he cares what happens to him as long as he's the strongest guy on the block. I just hope he doesn't come for me. I want to live a long and happy life.~ /*I tell you, he's got someone backing him. I don't know. Maybe... maybe it's got something to do with the zombies everywhere, and they wanted undead that still had a mind.*/
@21 = ~NP: What are you doing? I don't want anyone to draw attention! It's not safe there, considering that Drol and his &quot;Sword Coast Boys&quot; are killing everyone. You guards are idiots, you can risk your neck, and I don't want to end up like them...not me.~ /*What are you doing? I don't want anyone drawing attention here! It ain't safe out there, not with Drawl and his Sword Coast Boys making like corpses.*/
@22 = ~I don't have many answers, but it seems like the Sword Coast Boys are out of action. Everything's calming down in this district.~
