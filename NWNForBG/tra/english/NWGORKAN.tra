@0 = ~Aye? I s'pose yer here for the bloody dungeon, too, eh?~
@1 = ~What... dungeon?~
@2 = ~Yeah, that's me: here for the dungeon.~
@3 = ~No, I'm just passing through the area.~
@4 = ~Yes, of course. It should make for an interesting challenge.~
@5 = ~I will leave.~
@6 = ~What do you know? You don't know nothin'. Hmph. Pay me a hundred gold an' I'll tell you what's what, if yer interested.~
@7 = ~All right, here. 100 gold.~
@8 = ~I'll give you 100.~ 
@9 = ~You *will* tell me. NOW!~
@10 = ~Forget it.~
@11 = ~One 'as to wonder where Mutamin's been advertisin' his contest. Nobles here from all over the place come to watch us crawl through a dungeon. And you an' I both know it's gonna take a good thief to see all th' traps in there. An' that's *me*. So ye might as well just be goin' home.~ 
@12 = ~You don't have to worry. I will do it.~ 
@13 = ~Oh, please. I've spit out the likes of you for breakfast.~
@14 = ~That sounds like a horrible contest!~
@15 = ~Izzat so? Pardon me if I don't believe you. A rogue can't be too careful when he's about to come into a big reward, ye know.~
@16 = ~Hmph. 'Interesting challenge,' my arse. You knows how many nobles Mutamin charges a fortune to watch us die, eh? Well... we'll jus' see who makes it through an' gets Mutamin's reward an' who gets gutted fer the pleasure o' a few jaded aristocrats, mm?~ 
@17 = ~Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just don't get too drunk or I'll be pullin' off yer boots for you later. Ha!~
@18 = ~Well, y'see the owner there? That's Mutamin. He's a former adventurer, an' a successful one, too. Has a lot of gold, so the tale goes. He's put on a contest. There's a dungeon below this place, filled with monsters and traps. If someone gets through it, they gets the reward.~ 
@19 = ~It's all illegal as hades, but the nobles love comin' fer a good watch. Everyone knows a thief will take it, an' that's *me.* So you should run home, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.~
@20 = ~I thinks you be needin' to clean out them <RACE> ears o' yours. I said 100 gold, not 50. You want to know or not?~
@21 = ~What? Unless I tell you about this dungeon? You wouldn't dare touch me: not here, not down below. Bugger off already.~
@22 = ~Have it yer way, <GIRLBOY>. Best be runnin' home to yer mother, I can hears her teats leakin'.~
@23 = ~Well... we'll jus' see who makes it through an' gets Mutamin's reward an' who gets gutted fer the pleasure o' a few jaded aristocrats, mm?~
@24 = ~Har har! Now *that's* the kind o' spirit I like to hear in a competitor! Har har! Ye'll never get the reward with that attitude, <GIRLBOY>.~
@25 = ~You again? You want to know about the caves, right?~ 
@26 = ~I already know everything.~ 
@27 = ~Git along. I've got me own troubles.~
@28 = ~Bah! Yer not good enough by half, <GIRLBOY>! Ye best not get in me way in yon dungeon, or I'll treat ye like any other beastie I encounter! Got that?~
@29 = ~Ha! I told ye not to enter the bloody dungeon, fool! An' now I be forced to hack ye down where ye stand. So be it!~
