@0 = ~Welcome to the Gauntlet. I look forward to seeing you present yourself in the Pit.~
@1 = ~You have surpassed the level that Hrusk was fighting at. Very good. We shall have to see if you can best me.~
@2 = ~The medal in your possession proves you can best me, but I would prepare for a wholly different battle with Agar.~
@3 = ~Impressive medal. Claudus might even have to submit to you. That would be good. (hushed) I suspect he fights with an unfair advantage.~
@4 = ~I never thought I'd see it happen. I'm gonna miss this place.~
