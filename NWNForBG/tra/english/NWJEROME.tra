@0 = ~NP: What, are you stuck here yourself? And to everything else, there is still a lot of rabble here, they just lacked. Just terrible times, right? You see, I just want to get back to my job at the port. True, there is not much work with this quarantine, but at least there is no such stench from burning corpses.~ /*See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There's not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I'd be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.*/
@1 = ~Can't do squat with all the thieves everywhere. I don't know what's got into them, but it's made the Docks district unlivable. I can't go home for all the muggers.~
@2 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~Maybe somethings me can do?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~NP: Ah, I don't know, you'd better ask other people. I didn't have time to notice anything, except for the thieves chasing me as I ran. I just want to get back to work, but until someone blows a couple of heads off the docks, I can't get out of here. That's all I can tell you.~ /*Ah, I don't know anything you can't learn from better talkers than me. I ain't had time to see anything except them thieves nipping at my heels as I ran.*/
@6 = ~NP: I don't need charity. I just need to get back to the docks. Someone needs to get in there and take care of everything. I swear if my back didn't hurt like this, I'd be there by now, but I can't handle a whole army of thieves! Never.~ /*I ain't looking for charity. I just want to be able to get back in the docks. Someone needs to get in there and raise hell.*/
@7 = ~Bye then. Guess I'll just wait here. Nothing I can do. Why doesn't someone step up and be a damn hero?~
@8 = ~NP: Are you one of those damned thieves? It wouldn't be surprising if they came in here and made the same mess in the Heart of the City that got me out of the docks. You see, I just want to get back to my job at the port. True, there is not much work with this quarantine, but at least there is no such stench from burning corpses.~ /*See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There's not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I'd be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.*/
@9 = ~I hate this. Someone should lay down the law.~
@10 = ~Glad that somebody was willing to take those thieves to the woodshed. I gotta thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get back to work in there.~
