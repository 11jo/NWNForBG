@0 = ~MT: What you need? I'm not a guard, and I can't help you. I can only wait until the plague hits me, and I don't even have my own bed. I don't think it would be better if you had to lose your home, let alone the zombies chasing you. It's only a Beggars' Nest, of course, but it's better than just sitting here and breathing in the smoke of burning corpses.~ /*I don't suppose you'd feel any better yourself if you'd lost your home, let alone been chased out by zombies. It's just the Beggar's Nest, I know, but it's better than sitting here smelling the corpses burn.*/
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Maybe I could help you out?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~No, please, I don't want to think about this anymore than I have to.~
@5 = ~MT: Why would you help me? I'm just a commoner from the Beggars' Nest. Half the city is probably only glad that we have an invasion, even if it's zombies. Leave me alone. Please.~ /*Why would you help me? I'm just a lowly peasant from the Beggar's Nest. Half the city is probably happy to see the place overrun, even if it was by zombies.*/
@6 = ~Yeah, just leave me here. I've nowhere else to go.~
@7 = ~MT: Please don't touch me. I liked it as well. I have nothing. There is not even a place to lie down and die. I don't think it would be better if you had to lose your home, let alone the zombies chasing you. It's only a Beggars' Nest, of course, but it's better than just sitting here and breathing in the smoke of burning corpses.~ /*I don't suppose you'd feel any better yourself if you'd lost your home, let alone been chased out by zombies. It's just the Beggar's Nest, I know, but it's better than sitting here smelling the corpses burn.*/
@8 = ~The zombies are all gone? I don't know what to say. I am so happy to be able to go home... I mean, it's just the Beggar's Nest... but it's all I've got left.~
