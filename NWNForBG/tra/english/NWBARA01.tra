@0 = ~I can't believe Baram is dead. It can't be true... he must be in hiding or something...~
@1 = ~Ye're one of Baram's, aren't you? Good... maybe later we'll teach Kurth's men a lesson, here, no matter what the High Captain says.~
@2 = ~Ye're a nobody. Fit only t' be slaughtered in the streets.~
@3 = ~I get one o' the girls, next. Ye'll just have t' wait until the rest of us are done.~
@4 = ~Well, Baram's army isn't disbanding. Word is that someone's going to lead us soon.~
@5 = ~Those fellows are fools to follow Kurth. Baram will win, in the end.~
@6 = ~NP: What, are you from Kurt's army? Very stupid, <MALEFEMALE>.~ /*What, you one o' Kurth's? Foolish <MANWOMAN>.*/
@7 = ~I have to report to Baram tonight. I hate going into the sewers... all those disgusting ghouls everywhere...~
@8 = ~Baram isn't dead. Don't listen to all the rumors. He can't be killed, I seen him stabbed so many times an' he always healed.~
@9 = ~I heard Kurth's in league with a priestess of Auril. That's where all the monsters we fight with are comin' from.~
@10 = ~This place is Baram's. Leave, 'fore ye gets hurt.~
@11 = ~Baram says no fighting in the brothel... otherwise we'd kick those Bloody Hands but good, show 'em who's boss.~
@12 = ~NP: They say Baram was murdered. I bet one of Kurt's men did it. They're gonna have to pay.~ /*I bet one o' Kurth's men over there did it. They should pay...*/
@13 = ~Baram will be the last High Captain standing. Just you wait an' see.~
@14 = ~Kurth's men shouldn't even be allowed in here...~
@15 = ~Bah. Get away from me... I'm talking to my brothers, here.~
@16 = ~Kurth an' his Bloody Hands are holed up in West Harbor... an' if they're smart, they'll stay there.~
