@0 = ~There were rumors about a cure in the Blacklake, but I guess it isn't true. I wish it was, even if they weren't going to share.~
@1 = ~I heard one fo the militia went to the Blacklake and told those nobles to smarten' up! Still no cure, but at least they are catching hell, too.~
@2 = ~You must be one of the new city guard. Hopefully you can do something about those zombies in the Beggar's Nest.~
@3 = ~Are you one fo the new militia recruits? Maybe you had something to do with clearing the zombies out of the Beggar's Nest? Good on you if you did.~
@4 = ~MT: Be careful with people in this city. They only think of ripping everyone off. Jokes aside.~ /*Be wary of the humans in this town. They'll tax you extra for your <PRO_RACE> blood, I'm not joking.*/
@5 = ~I heard there was a prison break in the Peninsula district. I wonder if the rumors are true.~
@6 = ~Was that you that took care of the prison break in the Peninsula? I heard it was one of the new recruits, but I didn't get any names. Thanks if it was.~
@7 = ~You one of the new city guard? I heard someone new took care of the zombies in the Beggar's Nest. Good job, whoever it was.~
@8 = ~Ain't you handsome! Better stay away from the Docks - the thugs there will mess up that pretty face something awful.~
@9 = ~Hmph! You look like you must be one of them escaped convicts from the prison break in the Peninsula district!~
@10 = ~You're a holy <PRO_MANWOMAN> - can't you make the nobles in the Blacklake district share their cure with the rest of us?~
@11 = ~Those nobles in the Blacklake; one of them was hoarding food! I had heard they had a cure, but it was just plain old greed!~
@12 = ~Think carrying that weapon will keep the Wailing Death at bay?~
@13 = ~I heard the Docks district is quieter now. Maybe I should go there. I really need to get away from the smell of burning flesh.~
@14 = ~There's anarchy in the Docks district! I heard criminals have taken over and the city guard are afraid to go in there now.~
@15 = ~Hmph. Keep your magic to yourself around here, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Some blame sorcery for the plague! They might banish mages to the Mere of Dead Men. Maybe.~
