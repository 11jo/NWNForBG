@0 = ~Why have you entered my cave, tiny creature? Are you another adventurer seeking to get rich from Gorgotha's legendary hoard? You would be wise to answer.~ [DRACO354]
@1 = ~I'm searching for the Words of Power.~
@2 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Prepare to die, wyrm!~
@4 = ~I'll be going now.~
@5 = ~Klauth, the ancient red wyrm to the north, held one of the Words of Power. But now that Klauth has been slain I do not know what may have happened to the Word.~
@6 = ~Is there anything more you can tell me about Klauth?~
@7 = ~Are there more dragons in the area?~
@8 = ~I know something of these Words of Power. It is rumored that the foul Klauth has one in his possession, guarded by his fire giant servants.~
@9 = ~Klauth? Who is this Klauth?~
@10 = ~What did you say about fire giants?~
@11 = ~NP: Questions make me suspicious, creature <RACE>. Until Clout and his fire giants are off the face of the earth, I can trust no one. But I am a golden dragon, and such is the nobility of my race that I will answer your questions, despite the present danger that you are an agent of Clout himself.~ /*But I am a Gold Dragon and the nobility of my species is such that I will answer your questions despite the possibility that you are an agent of Klauth himself.*/
@12 = ~NP: Do you know anything about Words of Power?~ /*Do you know anything about the Words of Power?*/
@13 = ~NP: The questions make me suspicious, <RACE>. Too often those who speak to dragons wish to steal their treasures. But I will not judge you without proper evidence. Ask your questions.~ /*Questions make me suspicious, <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. Too often those who speak with dragons are plotting to steal their hoard. But I will not judge you without evidence. Ask your questions.*/
@14 = ~NP: I see you need to be taught a good lesson, you foolish <RACE>! I will kill you as I have already killed the fire giants that attacked my lair!~ /*I see you must be taught a lesson about the might of dragons, <PRO_RACE> fool! I shall slaughter you as I did the fire giants who attacked my lair!*/
@15 = ~Then go. Your presence here in my cave makes me uneasy, <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. These are dark times for my kind, and I trust no one.~
@16 = ~Then go with my blessing, <PRO_RACE> creature. I cannot thank you enough for slaying Klauth and preserving my eggs.~
@17 = ~NP: Klout's power is over. Never again will his servants rape the Ridge of Peace and steal dragon eggs from these mountains. Klauth is dead, and his plans for the eggs of other dragons are over, along with his life. He is now nothing more than a memory.~ /*Klauth is dead, and whatever foul purpose he intended for the stolen eggs of the other dragons ended with his life. He is nothing but a memory now.*/
@18 = ~NP: There have always been many dragons here on Peace Ridge. To the west, the brass dragoness Skilandara once made her lair, but I haven't seen her in many moons. In the northwest lives a vain and vicious worm named Akulatraxas, but we golden dragons have no contact with her or her kin. The rest of us fled after Clout's fire giants began attacking our lairs.~ /*Further to the south is a vain and evil green wyrm named Akulatraxas, but we Gold Dragons have little to do with her kind. The others have all fled since Klauth's fire giants started raiding our lairs.*/
@19 = ~NP: Scrogg, king of the fire giants of the north, has sworn allegiance to Clout, an ancient and incredibly vicious red dragon. Now Clout lives in the fire giants' lair in the northwest, and they are ready to fulfill his every whim. And so Clout has sent his minions into the mountains of Peace Ridge to slay dragons, steal their eggs, and bring them to Clout.~ /*Skrogg, king of the fire giants in the north, has sworn allegiance to Klauth, an ancient red dragon of unimaginable evil. Now Klauth lives with the fire giants in their lair to the north and they serve his every whim.*/
@20 = ~Why does Klauth want dragon eggs?~
@21 = ~Why don't you just leave the area?~
@22 = ~I could get rid of Klauth for you.~
@23 = ~Questions make me suspicious, <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. Too often those who speak with dragons are plotting to steal their hoard. But I will not judge you without evidence. Ask your questions.~
@24 = ~I do not know why Klauth hunts the eggs of other dragons, but the reason is surely one of pure evil. Klauth is a monster, his name is a curse among my species. Even other red dragons fear him.~
@25 = ~My eggs will soon hatch, I cannot risk taking them on a great journey with my brood so close to hatching. I must stay here to defend my lair and my children from falling into Klauth's clawed clutches.~
@26 = ~NP: You? But you're just a bipedal <RACE>! Clout is an ancient red worm! Even I, a golden dragon, am afraid of its power. And yet. times are strange now, and I am desperate. I dare not leave this place until my children sprout. Only death can stop Klout from stealing my eggs. Bring me proof of his death.~ /*You? But you are nothing but a <PRO_RACE> creature! Klauth is an ancient red wyrm! Even I, a Gold Dragon, fear his power. Still... these are strange times, and I am desperate. I dare not leave until my eggs have hatched.*/
@27 = ~NP: Bring me the head of the Clout worm, and the greatest of my treasures will be yours.~ /*Nevermind the tooth. Just the key and your gold will do.*/
@28 = ~I will do this for you, Gorgotha!~
@29 = ~I'd need some kind of payment up front for an undertaking as dangerous as this.~
@30 = ~NP: I admire your courage, little creature. Come back to me when you have Klout's head. Otherwise, I will assume this was all an attempt to somehow get me off my balls. I wish you luck, though frankly I'm sure you're doomed to a gruesome doom. But for the sake of my unborn offspring, I hope I'm wrong.~ /*I admire your courage, small one. Return to me when you have Klauth's head. Otherwise I may think this has all been a deception to somehow trick me out of my eggs.*/
@31 = ~NP: Gorgotha, the golden dragon

The servants of Clout, an ancient red worm, attacked the lair of the golden dragoness Gorgotha several times. In exchange for Clout's head, Gorgotha offered to give up some of her stashed treasure.~ /*The servants of Klauth, an ancient red wyrm, have been attacking the lair of the gold dragon Gorgotha.
In exchange for Klauth's head Gorgotha has offered a share of her treasure hoard.*/
@32 = ~NP: Don't be foolish, <RACE>. I promised you a share of my treasure. No one dares question the honor of the golden dragons..... unless this is all a trick to get me to leave my treasure. If you feel the risk is too great, I understand. But I will not give up a single piece of my treasure until I have Klout's head at my feet.~ /*Do not be foolish, <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. I have promised you a share of my hoard. The honor of a gold dragon is beyond question... unless this is all just a plan to trick me out of my treasure hoard.*/
@33 = ~For what reason have you violated the sanctity of this cave? Have you come seeking Gorgotha's eggs? You would be wise to answer me, tiny one.~ [DRACO352]
@34 = ~Eggs? Why would I want your eggs?~
@35 = ~Klauth has offered a great reward for each dragon egg brought to the lair by his fire giant servants. It would not surprise me to find some greedy adventurers are eager to collect this reward as well.~
@36 = ~NP: Do you know anything about Words of Power?~ /*Do you know anything about the Words of Power?*/
@37 = ~Why have you returned to my cave, tiny creature? You would be wise to answer me, lest you incur the wrath of the mighty Gorgotha!~ [DRACO253]
@38 = ~**sniff - sniff** I smell blood and... something else. Something foul. **SNIFF** You have the head of Klauth the ancient red wyrm! Give it to me that I might see the proof of his death with my own eyes!~ [DRACO251]
@39 = ~I am honored to give you the wyrm's head, mighty Gorgotha.~
@40 = ~NP: Klout is finally finished! No more of his minions will attack my lair! The ancient worm's evil power is over! We dragons don't like to share our treasure, but you deserve a reward. Take this, the best treasure I've ever collected.~ /*We dragons are loathe to part with our treasure hoard, but you have earned your reward. Take this, the premier item of all the treasure I have collected.*/
@41 = ~I thank you for this generous gift, mighty Gorgotha.~
@42 = ~NP: But your offspring's lives are worth more than you offered me, aren't they?~ /*I think your wife's safety is worth more than that, no?*/
@43 = ~NP: Give me more gold, or I'll break your balls!~ /*Give more gold or me smash you eggs!*/
@44 = ~NP: So, my little hero, it's time to say goodbye. Go with my blessings.~ /*Now, my little hero. Is there anything else I can do for you?*/
@45 = ~NP: Gorgotha, the golden dragon

The head of the worm Clout has been delivered to the golden dragoness Gorgotha. She can now rest assured that her eggs will remain intact.~ /*The head of the wyrm Klauth has been delivered to the dragon Gorgotha, assuring her of the continued survival of her eggs.*/
@46 = ~NP: You are impertinent, creature <RACE>, if you demand treasure from a dragoness in her own lair. But there is truth in what you say, so I suppose I can offer you something more. Take this ring. Its power may prove useful to you. But you would be wise not to press me further. My scales may be covered in gold, but my temper remains that of a dragon.~ /*Take this ring. Its power may be of some use to you. But you would be wise not to press me further. My scales may be hued with golden virtue, but my temper is still that of a dragon.*/
@47 = ~You have already been well rewarded for your task, <PRO_RACE> one. Do not press me further. My scales may be hued with golden virtue, but my temper is still that of a dragon.~
@48 = ~I have treated you with nothing but respect, <PRO_RACE> creature, and now you dare threaten my children? Such a crime is unforgivable! Feel the fury of Gorgotha unleashed!~
@49 = ~NP: Gorgotha, the golden dragon

Gorgoth's golden dragoness has been slain.~ /*The gold dragon Gorgotha has been slain.*/
@50 = ~I remember you. You are the one who brought me the head of Klauth. Because of you I no longer need fear for the lives of my children. How may I help you?~ [DRACO250]
