@0 = ~Well, welcome to the Moonstone Mask, handsome stranger! I'm Tamora, and I'll be your dream for the evening. Won't you be mine?~ [TAMORA53]
@1 = ~MT: I will talk to you... And not only talk.~ /*I would speak with you... and perhaps more.*/
@2 = ~There's more than talking, right?~
@3 = ~Whatever, harlot. I'm not here to talk.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Wow, ever the gent. Not like some other jerks. Well, pony up a Pass Coin and you have my time. More than that... we'll see.~
@6 = ~Here is a Pass Coin. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@7 = ~MT: Here is the pass.~ /*Question*/
@8 = ~I don't have a Pass Coin.~
@9 = ~What's that about your other clients?~
@10 = ~Maybe, if you are less of a jerk. I've had enough from... well, enough of that. Pony up a Pass Coin and we'll start with a little chat.~
@11 = ~MT: What about other clients? From whom did you get it?~ /*What's that about your other clients?*/
@12 = ~Oh, a tough guy. I have enough clients like that, but that ain't your business. You want my time? Get a Pass Coin and an attitude adjustment.~
@13 = ~Bye then. If you come back, make sure you bring a Pass Coin. I can't say all that much, otherwise.~
@14 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? I listen well enough, if that's what you want.~
@15 = ~You listen well? Does talking make your "clients" more relaxed?~
@16 = ~Let's talk about you, and what you like.~
@17 = ~Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?~
@18 = ~Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers, my lady?~
@19 = ~Let's knock boots, honey!~
@20 = ~I must be on my way.~
@21 = ~MT: Okay, tell me about yourself. What are you thinking about? I'm good at listening if that's what you want.~ /*Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? I listen well enough, if that's what you want.*/
@22 = ~What, I'm supposed to talk for free? I don't think so. Pay the bartender for the Coins. He's got plenty.~
@23 = ~I guess. It's more to see whether I like them or not. They confide and I show them support. Do you need that sort of thing? What bothers you?~
@24 = ~Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.~
@25 = ~Bemoan about how no one really respects you.~
@26 = ~Me strong. Nothing hurt me.~
@27 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@28 = ~Me? This really isn't about me. I'm what you want, and nothing more. Besides, can you believe anything I say when you're paying for it?~
@29 = ~I'd find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.~
@30 = ~That's very selfless, giving of yourself like that.~
@31 = ~Where are you from? What is your story?~
@32 = ~Harsh. Aren't you supposed to have a heart of gold?~
@33 = ~MT: I don't take things to heart. Very rarely. You have to try to get me into something.~ /*Not likely. I don't let things get to me. Not usually, anyway. People really have to try to get under my skin.*/
@34 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@35 = ~Shouldn't you be ashamed of working here?~
@36 = ~MT: A true gentleman. You know<CHARNAME> , I like you. I think I will accept your offer. Follow me. We'll put out the lights for a while.~ /*Such a gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing.*/
@37 = ~MT: A true gentleman, I like you. I think I will accept your offer. Follow me. We'll put out the lights for a while.~ /*Such a gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing.*/
@38 = ~Let's talk a bit more. You aren't the type to move too fast, are you? Nah, you want to last awhile. Let's talk some more.~
@39 = ~Slow down! This ain't a calf roping. You charge ahead and the only thing you'll get is my foot in your butt. Trust me, you wouldn't like it.~
@40 = ~If you want, but you can't just start back where we leave off. If you come back, you'll have to pay again. So, you going?~
@41 = ~I'll stay a while, I think.~
@42 = ~I must leave. Farewell.~
@43 = ~MT: Well, no wonder you feel this way. Maybe you deserve it. I don't know. I never understood how people can have so much and still be so empty. I'm not going to judge anyone. Everyone needs sympathy, no matter how happy their life is.~ /*Well, you might have reason to feel that way. Maybe you deserve it. I don't know. I never really understood how some people can have so much and still be empty.*/
@44 = ~Nothing bothers me. I am strong.~
@45 = ~MT: Harsh words, but I know a lot of men who talk the same way, but in fact they are mere kittens. And what about you? Do you feel lonely, or do people not like you the way you should? Don't say you don't need company. Otherwise you wouldn't be here, would you? Of course, you could only have come here so as not to suffer with a real relationship. There is nothing to be ashamed of.~ /*Maybe you feel lonely or not as well-liked as you should be? It's not like you don't need companions. You came here, didn't you?*/
@46 = ~Of course. Our time can be spent any way that you wish. Within reason, of course. Mood is so important.~
@47 = ~Too bad for you, I guess. People hide from each other all the time. I just tell you about it upfront.~
@48 = ~Ain't none of your business, as I said. Now, did you want some engaging discourse or are you just wasting my time?~
@49 = ~You're having problems? Perhaps it *should* be my business.~
@50 = ~Don't tease! Tell me about your client or shut the hell up!~
@51 = ~MT: Maybe. I dont think about it. I love hiding behind masks. And not everyone likes to talk about their lives. And some just love to talk, they don't care if they listen or not.~ /*I suppose. I don't think about it. I just like putting on the masks. Not everyone wants a deep chat about life, either.*/
@52 = ~Doesn't really matter, does it? I'm from here. I'll be here long enough for you. Let's be happy with that. I am.~
@53 = ~MT: Ha! Doesn't matter. I'm here because I'm well paid. Very good. And the people are good... For the most part. If there are problems with anyone, they are dealt with. I talk to people, they relax, and then we sometimes spend some time in the dark. As in life, but without stress. Much better than working on a farm.~ /*I get people talking, loosen them up a bit, and maybe we spend some time in the dark. It's like life, but less of a burden. Beats farming.*/
@54 = ~MT: Will you help me? Yes! Let me tell you everything, and then we'll see if you can help. You see, there is one guy who really likes to mock me. He follows me everywhere and scares away good clients ... Such are the things. His name is Hoff. Always stuck on the docks. Controls everything. Maybe you can give him a message? Best in the form of a kick in the ass.~ /*See, I've got this guy who's decided he really likes tormenting me. He follows me around and some of my good clients get threatened... that sort of thing.*/
@55 = ~Hoff? Was he a half-Orc? He's already dead.~
@56 = ~What's in it for me?~
@57 = ~Perhaps I can look into it. I'll see.~
@58 = ~I'll maybe take a look. Now, about that chat?~
@59 = ~Whoa, none of that. Ophala doesn't want it spoken of in here. Figures that would be like inviting it in.~
@60 = ~Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.~
@61 = ~MT: If I should be ashamed, what can I say about you? You yourself support this profession. Nobody dragged you here. Shall we return to our pleasant conversation, or would you like to leave?~ /*If I'm supposed to feel ashamed, what are you supposed to feel like? You're the one supporting the profession. No one forced you in here.*/
@62 = ~MT: Maybe I should have just kicked you out of here... Although, such a bastard will help me deal with another bastard. You see, there is one guy who really likes to mock me. He follows me everywhere and scares away good clients ... Such are the things. His name is Hoff. Always stuck on the docks. Controls everything. Maybe you can give him a message? Best in the form of a kick in the ass.~ /*See, I've got this guy who's decided he really likes tormenting me. He follows me around and some of my good clients get threatened... that sort of thing.*/
@63 = ~Well good. Let's chat a little more. You've got some interesting things to say. Really. I mean that. Yeah.~
@64 = ~Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.~
@65 = ~MT: This is more than I expected. But I won't shed a tear for him. He was a real bastard. Thank you. Don't expect any big reward from me. I have nothing but gratitude and kind words.~ /*Don't be expecting a great reward or anything. I don't have much beyond gratitude and a good thought.*/
@66 = ~I don't know. Applause? Look, if you want to do a good deed, go do it. I don't need to be in debt to another jerk.~
@67 = ~MT: Oh, thank you for the touching promise. Here, take the brooch so Hoff knows I sent you. Take care of her! Return when you're done! I wouldn't give it away if it wasn't so important. This Hoff... I don't know much about him. Remember, he's somewhere on the docks.~ /*Gee, thanks for that stirring pledge. Here, take my brooch so Hoff will know I sent you. Be careful! I want it back when all this is done!*/
@68 = ~MT: Take your time. Here, take the brooch so Hoff knows I sent you. Take care of her! Return when you're done! I wouldn't give it away if it wasn't so important. This Hoff... I don't know much about him. Remember, he's somewhere on the docks.~ /*I wouldn't have given it up if this wasn't important. That Hoff... I don't know about him. Remember, he's in the Docks somewhere.*/
@69 = ~What are you doing here, then? Yeesh. I mean, I'm sure it's a lot of pressure, but shouldn't you get to it?~
@70 = ~Hello there. You here for business or pleasure? Before you say "pleasure is your business," let me remind you that I'll kick you square if you do.~ [TAMORA52]
@71 = ~I'm here as a Moonstone Mask customer.~
@72 = ~MT: You have problems?~ /*What problems?*/
@73 = ~I'm here about the business with Hoff.~
@74 = ~If you're looking for some fun, I'm off the market for the moment. It's been a trying bunch of days, let me tell you.~
@75 = ~MT: You see, there is one guy who really likes to mock me. He follows me everywhere and scares away good clients ... Such are the things. His name is Hoff. Always stuck on the docks. Controls everything. Maybe you can give him a message? Best in the form of a kick in the ass.~ /*See, I've got this guy who's decided he really likes tormenting me. He follows me around and some of my good clients get threatened... that sort of thing.*/
@76 = ~Oh, and what do you have to tell me?~
@77 = ~He's dead. Here's your brooch.~
@78 = ~MT: He is dead. Your brooch has unfortunately been lost.~ /*He's dead. Here's your brooch.*/
@79 = ~MT: He's shaking all over with fear. Here is your brooch.~ /*He scaredy-baby now. Here your brooch.*/
@80 = ~MT: He's shaking all over with fear. Your brooch has unfortunately been lost.~ /*He scaredy-baby now. Here your brooch.*/
@81 = ~MT: Nothing~ /*Nothing.*/
@82 = ~MT: This will make him stay away. I hope he doesn't hurt anyone else. He could have been killed. It would be unpleasant. Don't expect any big reward from me. I have nothing but gratitude and kind words.~ /*That should keep him away then. Hopefully he doesn't start bugging anyone else. He might end up dead. That would be a shame.*/
@83 = ~Don't tease me with this garbage.~
@84 = ~Sorry little lady, I'm not your type. You'll have to go talk to Tanith. He's a big sweety.~ [TAMORA50]
@85 = ~MT: Hello. If you want to have fun, then I'm temporarily not working. I had a difficult period, really.~ [TAMORA52] /*If you're looking for some fun, I'm off the market for the moment. It's been a trying bunch of days, let me tell you.*/
@86 = ~Son of a bitch! Hoff got my brooch! That's the last time I trust anyone!~ [TAMORA51]
@87 = ~Here's your brooch. Hoff doesn't have it.~
@88 = ~Hoff is dead. Here is your brooch.~
@89 = ~MT: He, unlike you, offered money for her.~ /*Fine, you keep money.*/
@90 = ~MT: Oh... So... Someone sold it to him and then stole it back? Well, this will be a lesson to him... I hope. I do not understand this. It's like people go out of their way to complicate things. Don't expect any big reward from me. I have nothing but gratitude and kind words.~ /*Oh... soooo... someone sold it to him and then stole it back? I suppose that will teach him a lesson or something... I guess.*/
@91 = ~MT: Oh... So... Someone sold it to him and then killed him and took the brooch back? I think that's exactly what I wanted. Don't expect any big reward from me. I have nothing but gratitude and kind words.~ /*Okay... sooo.... someone sold it to him and then killed him to get it back? I guess that's what I wanted.*/
@92 = ~Whatever. I'm not talking to anyone anymore. I can't believe this!~
