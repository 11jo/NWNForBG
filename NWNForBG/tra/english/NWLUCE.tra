@0 = ~Good day, sir. My name is Luce. I trust you wish your visit to the Moonstone Mask to be a pleasant one.~ [NWLUC054]
@1 = ~I would speak with you... and perhaps more.~
@2 = ~There's more than talking, right?~
@3 = ~Whatever, harlot. I'm not here to talk.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Well, aren't you sweet, but remember that a Pass Coin only entitles you to my time. Anything beyond that is my discretion. I'm sure we'll get along fine, though.~
@6 = ~Here is a Pass Coin. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@7 = ~Here is a Pass Coin.~
@8 = ~I don't have a Pass Coin.~
@9 = ~I will try to abide your gruff demeanor, but remember that a Pass Coin buys my time, not my will. If your words displease me, this encounter will end.~
@10 = ~I think you should reconsider your tone. A Pass Coin purchases my time, not my will. If I am not pleased with your behavior, this encounter will end.~
@11 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time. Just remember to provide a Pass Coin. They are available from the bartender.~
@12 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.~
@13 = ~You listen well? Does talking make your "clients" more relaxed?~
@14 = ~Let's talk about you, and what you like.~
@15 = ~Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?~
@16 = ~Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers, my lady?~
@17 = ~Let's knock boots, honey!~
@18 = ~I must be on my way.~
@19 = ~Very well, now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.~ 
@20 = ~Well, I regret to inform you that I cannnot speak with you unless you have one. I'm sorry. See the bartender if you wish to purchase one.~
@21 = ~Important people are not often able to confide with people that care. I am a surrogate and a friend, if need be. Tell me, what bothers you?~
@22 = ~Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.~
@23 = ~(Bemoan about how no one really respects you.)~
@24 = ~I am strong. Nothing can hurt me.~
@25 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@26 = ~Me? Tonight I am whatever you wish. I am a confidant and a friend, if that is what you need me to be.~
@27 = ~I'd find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.~
@28 = ~That's very selfless, giving of yourself like that.~
@29 = ~Where are you from? What is your story?~
@30 = ~A prostitute with a heart of gold. Oh, that's new.~
@31 = ~I try not to worry my companions unnecessarily, but I will endeavor to talk about whatever you like.~ 
@32 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@33 = ~Shouldn't you be ashamed of working here?~
@34 = ~Such a gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing. Follow me, my dear. Let's leave these bright lights off for awhile.~ 
@35 = ~Such a gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing. Follow me, my dear. Let's leave these bright lights off for awhile.~ 
@36 = ~Not just yet. Patience is a virtue. Perhaps we should spend a little more time getting to know each other.~
@37 = ~I hardly think so. No, I have every right to refuse such a... distasteful advance. There is an art to this. You can't just charge like a bull.~
@38 = ~That is your option, but I must tell you that you will have to purchase another Pass Coin to speak with me again. Do you still wish to leave?~
@39 = ~I'll stay a while, I think.~
@40 = ~I must leave. Farewell.~
@41 = ~Of course you feel that way. Many people in power have a sense of yearning that just can't seem to be filled, despite their great responsibilities. You can let it all go with me. I am not here to judge, or to laud your position. I am here with you, stripped of your trappings. You're true to yourself, and you follow the path that you've chosen because it is right for you. That's the mark of a strong man.~ 
@42 = ~Nothing bothers me. I am strong.~
@43 = ~I am sure you are quite capable, but is your emotional armor so perfect? There is no shame in needing a kind word now and then.~
@44 = ~Of course. Our time can be spent any way that you wish. Within reason, of course. Mood is so important.~
@45 = ~Well, then it is fortunate that I am not you. I give comfort where it is needed. What do you do, besides malign the choices of others?~
@46 = ~I'm done with you. That was hurtful and inappropriate.~
@47 = ~Many people come here not knowing what it is they want. I try to make them comfortable. I try to ease what bothers them. Some people just need a sympathetic ear. More than you would think, actually. I hope I make a difference in their lives.~ 
@48 = ~Well, a long time ago I was born to a loving family. And now I am here with you. Nothing is more important than that right now.~
@49 = ~Look, if you want someone to kick you in the head there are special rooms for that in some of the dirtier dockside taverns. My job is to listen and further a positive dialogue. If you don't want that, the door is behind you. Now... (ahem)... You were saying?~ 
@50 = ~I will not tolerate rudeness.~ 
@51 = ~For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons, and you have other talents as well. Such versatility and the affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes. I can close that distance, if you like. That's why I'm here, and likely that's why you are here too.~
@52 = ~Nothing, and I couldn't say if I did. Call it superstitious, but Ophala was very explicit in requesting that we don't talk of it. This really isn't the time or place for such things. Let's get back to you, and what you need.~ 
@53 = ~Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.~
@54 = ~Shouldn't you reserve your judgment for your own actions? I stand before you unashamed. Who are you to project your fears on me? Now, shall we return to our pleasant chat, or will you exercise your right to use the door behind you?~ 
@55 = ~I'm glad. Maybe we can talk some more.~
@56 = ~Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.~
@57 = ~For instance, you seem a roguish type. Irreverent. Perhaps someone that enjoys playing with people. Sometimes that can keep companions at a distance. I can close that distance, if you like. That's why I'm here, and likely that's why you are here too.~ 
@58 = ~For instance, you look very in tune with nature. A good calling, but perhaps it keeps your companions at a distance? I can close that distance, if you like. That's why I'm here, and likely that's why you are here too.~ 
@59 = ~For instance, you look very devout, and sure of your spiritual side. That can sometimes keep friends at a distance if they don't understand. I can close that distance, if you like. That's why I'm here, and likely that's why you are here too.~ 
@60 = ~For instance, you seem very learned of arcane matters. Perhaps it sometimes keeps companions at a distance? Some people react with suspicion to such things. I can close that distance, if you like. That's why I'm here, and likely that's why you are here too.~ 
@61 = ~For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes. I can close that distance, if you like. That's why I'm here, and likely that's why you are here too.~ 
@62 = ~This talk is over. Get out before I call the guards.~
@63 = ~Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don't know it. That must weigh on your mind. I can't help you in whatever task you percieve is yours, <CHARNAME>, but I can try to ease your mind. I don't expect anything from you.~ 
@64 = ~Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don't know it. That must weigh on your mind. I can't help you in whatever task you percieve is yours, <CHARNAME>, but I can try to ease your mind. I don't expect anything from you.~ 
@65 = ~I am sorry, m'lady, but my company is open to males alone. You might wish to see if Tanith is free.~ [NWLUC050]
@66 = ~No, I've been mistreated enough for today. I'm off. Go somewhere else.~ [NWLUC051]
@67 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. I trust you are well? I hope I had some impact on you. Some people have trouble recognizing when they really need someone to talk to.~ [NWLUC052]
@68 = ~I enjoyed our time together. I hope you did as well.~
@69 = ~Me like you. Hope you like me a little.~
@70 = ~You just one more for the road. Ha!~
@71 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are ever the perfect gentleman. You needn't worry. No judgments, remember?~
@72 = ~Yes, silly, I like you fine. Don't let people get you down saying you are... uh... slow. You're a charmer, you are.~
@73 = ~Ah, I trust you are well? I hope I had some impact on you. Some people have trouble recognizing when they really need someone to talk to.~ [NWLUC052]
@74 = ~You are ever the perfect gentleman. You needn't worry. No judgments, remember?~
