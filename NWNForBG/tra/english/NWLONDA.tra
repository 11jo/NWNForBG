@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I have some questions.~
@3 = ~NP: What happened to you?~ /*What happened here?*/
@4 = ~Fine, I'll go.~
@5 = ~I am... or, rather, I was... the Countess Londa Whitesnow. That means nothing anymore. Now I am merely... Londa.~
@6 = ~Then what happened?~
@7 = ~Aww... poor rich noble lost all her gold?~
@8 = ~You lost your title? That isn't everything.~
@9 = ~Did you not hear me? I wish to be left alone, <SIRMAAM>. Please respect that.~
@10 = ~At least tell me who you are, then.~
@11 = ~Why? What's wrong?~
@12 = ~I see. You're too good to talk to me, is that it?~
@13 = ~(sigh) I see you intend to be persistent. Very well. You wish to know what is wrong? I shall tell you... though my story is not a unique one, here. That evil man, High Captain Baram, invaded our home with his soldiers. He desired all our wealth... to pay for his army and his war, no doubt.~ /*That evil man, High Captain Baram, invaded our home with his soldiers. He desired all our wealth... to pay for his army and his war, no doubt.*/
@14 = ~You have my sincere thanks. I only wish to be left to my grief.~
@15 = ~You know nothing of me, and obviously you would not understand if you did. Indeed, I have no gold for myself or anyone else any longer. Now begone, and leave me to my misery.~
@16 = ~The title is nothing. I would have gladly given it up, and all the wealth that went with it, to still have my family. They are all that gave the others meaning.~
@17 = ~Uh-huh. It be bad story, me thinking.~
@18 = ~That... that is not what I meant at all. In fact, it is quite the opposite. I was once Countess Londa Whitesnow... but now I am... merely Londa.~
@19 = ~My husband objected, naturally. Without even a thought, Baram... he... cut my husband down. Murdered him. I still remember his laughter as he took my children... all nine of them... and turned me out of my home. Once he was done with it, he burned it to the ground. Now my husband is dead, and that fiend holds my children. I know nothing of their fate and have nothing left and nowhere to turn. That is my tale, <SIRMAAM>.~ /*Now my husband is dead, and that fiend holds my children. I know nothing of their fate and have nothing left and nowhere to turn. That is my tale, <SIRMAAM>.*/
@20 = ~That is very sad.~
@21 = ~Sounds like a tough break.~
@22 = ~Hah! At least you're still alive.~
@23 = ~Aye, it is very sad. I would do anything to have my children back, but Baram will not even see me... and no one can help.~
@24 = ~Perhaps I could help.~
@25 = ~I could help... for the right reward.~
@26 = ~Yes, well, life's tough all over.~
@27 = ~You speak crudely, but it is true enough. I would do anything to have my children back... but Baram will not even see me, and no one can help.~
@28 = ~Forgive me, but that fact currently pales compared to all I have lost. Please... leave me to my misery.~
@29 = ~I am grateful. I only wish to be left to my misery.~
@30 = ~Could you? I would give anything to have my children saved from that fiend, or to at least... at least know that they are all right! I could reward you. I have no coin here, but... my husband had some saved. I know where it is, and I could tell you. It would be enough, I think.~ /*Could you? I would give anything to have my children saved from that fiend, or to at least... at least know that they are all right!*/
@31 = ~Tell me where it is now and I'll do it.~
@32 = ~Very well... I'll help you.~
@33 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@34 = ~I changed my mind. Not interested.~
@35 = ~Aye... life is 'tough' for everyone in Luskan, and we should all just bear through it, is that what you mean? Just... leave me be, <SIRMAAM>.~
@36 = ~I am no fool. If that is all there is that will get someone to find my children, then I will never give it up beforehand.~
@37 = ~I am glad to hear it. Have you any questions for me, then?~
@38 = ~Where can I find Baram?~
@39 = ~Do you know where your children might be?~
@40 = ~Why would Baram be holding your children?~
@41 = ~Does Baram have any enemies?~
@42 = ~NP: I do not have any questions.~ /*Me have other question.*/
@43 = ~I... I see. Then leave me alone.~
@44 = ~His men once had a base in the slums... but that was burnt down more than a month ago as the war in the streets went on. Where he has gone since, I... simply do not know. Some people say he lives in the sewers, now, but I truly hope not.~ /*His men once had a base in the slums... but that was burnt down more than a month ago as the war in the streets went on.*/
@45 = ~No. I have heard no news, and Baram will tell me nothing. He is the only one who would know where they are.~
@46 = ~I... wish I knew. Perhaps he has some sinister purpose in mind for them... I do not even want to imagine it. I am hoping he has already sent them somewhere or released them and I simply do not know where they are.~
@47 = ~Aye. The other High Captains who he has fought with these long weeks. Only Kurth remains... but no one is sure where he is. Kurth would want Baram dead, it is certain.~
@48 = ~You have given me a glimmer of hope. I... I wish you the best of luck.~

@50 = ~You have heard my sorry tale, <SIRMAAM>. Is that not enough?~ [NWLOND52]
@51 = ~You... return. Have you found my children? Are they safe?~ [NWLOND51]
@52 = ~I have spoken to Baram... He says your children are safe.~
@53 = ~Baram has reneged on his deal. He will not release your children.~
@54 = ~Your children are fine, Londa... but I can't bring them to you.~
@55 = ~I am sorry, Londa. All your children are dead...~
@56 = ~They're dead, actually. Baram and his rats ate them.~
@57 = ~NP: So far there are no results.~ /*Not yet, no.*/
@58 = ~That is a great relief... though until I see my children in person, I have my doubts as to whether the fiend is telling the truth. Is there any way my children can be rescued? Do you know?~ /*That is a great relief... though until I see my children in person, I have my doubts as to whether the fiend is telling the truth.*/
@59 = ~I have agreed to perform a service for Baram in return for their release.~
@60 = ~Baram wanted me to kill Kurth for their release, but I refused.~
@61 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@62 = ~NP: No! Noooo! Please... do something! A little more, and we would meet again! Please find my children!~ /*No! No-ooo! Please, my <LADYLORD>... do something! I cannot come this close and not find them! Please find my babies!*/
@63 = ~Fine? I... but why not? Bring me to them, then! I must see them!~
@64 = ~Baram... sent them away. To orphanages, elsewhere. I don't know where they are.~
@65 = ~I can't lie to you, Londa. Your children are dead...~
@66 = ~Fine, make me tell the truth. Baram and his rats ate your kids.~
@67 = ~D-dead? No... no, I don't believe it...~
@68 = ~They... ate them?~
@69 = ~The small ones. The rest he turned into wererats... and they're dead, too.~
@70 = ~It's the truth. I thought you should know.~
@71 = ~(yawn!) You'll get over it.~
@72 = ~I had gotten my hopes up, seeing you. Please find them! I cannot bear not knowing where they are!~
@73 = ~You have? I... dare not ask what it is. Whatever you do, free my children and I will be forever grateful. If they are well, I must see them!~
@74 = ~Nor do I blame you. I certainly could not ask you to do such a thing. But... surely there must be some way to free them! Can you not... sneak into his base, or wherever Baram is? Break the door down, I don't know... just find them, I beg you!~ /*Can you not... sneak into his base, or wherever Baram is? Break the door down, I don't know... just find them, I beg you!*/
@75 = ~When you find out more, please tell me. If they are truly safe, I cannot bear to be apart from them! You must rescue them, I beg you!~
@76 = ~He... sent them to orphanages? Outside the city?~
@77 = ~But you have... little Tomlen's bear. That's his, without a doubt. Th-thank you for... telling me... the truth. Here is the key to my husband's vault. It is in the sewers... in a long passage north of the water. Now I must... I must go. I... please, excuse me...~ /*Th-thank you for... telling me... the truth. Here is the key to my husband's vault. It is in the sewers... in a long passage north of the water.*/

@79 = ~No. I refuse to believe it. I won't! You have no proof, none, that what you're saying is true! Bring me something... anything... that proves what you say and I'll... I'll believe it. Please, my <LADYLORD>... I'm begging you!~ /*No. I refuse to believe it. I won't! You have no proof, none, that what you're saying is true!*/
@80 = ~Very well. I shall return.~
@81 = ~Forget it. I don't care if you don't believe me.~
@82 = ~Look... I just want the coin. That's all.~
@83 = ~And I... shall... wait here. Yes.~
@84 = ~NP: Oh. I... forgive me for... not believing you... Forgive me,<SIRMAAM> . I need... I need to go.~ /*Ah. I... forgive me for... doubting you...*/
@85 = ~No. You won't get it. I want the proof!~
@86 = ~You gives me coin or you meets husband!~
@87 = ~You wretch! You evil, pathetic <MANWOMAN>! You want my husband's coin, do you?! Is that all you desire?! Then here... take the key to his vault! Now I... I must... go. I... excuse me...~ /*You wretch! You evil, pathetic <MANWOMAN>! You want my husband's coin, do you?! Is that all you desire?! Then here... take the key to his vault!*/
@88 = ~NP: For the sake of your gods, help. My children disappeared, Baram took them. Do you know anything about them?~ /*I gave it to someone else already. I'm sorry. Is there something else you wanted?*/
