@0 = ~You've beaten me. I cannot defeat you, try as I might - though fighting you was not my desire. And now I would only ask that you show mercy and let me leave, defeated.~ [NWDELI60]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~No deals. I'm here for your death.~
@3 = ~Haha! Oh my, all of this fighting and you don't even have a reason to kill me. And here I thought you were a bounty hunter. Then again, perhaps you are. Either way, my name is Delilah. I'd say it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, but I'm sure you understand the truth.~ /*Then again, perhaps you are. Either way, my name is Delilah. I'd say it's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, but I'm sure you understand the truth.*/
@4 = ~Delilah! You're one of the escaped convicts I've been told about.~
@5 = ~What's this about bounty hunters?~
@6 = ~I'm done talking. It's time for you to die.~
@7 = ~Do you even know who I am? Do you even care? No, I can see that you don't. Come at me, then, and end this!~
@8 = ~One thing that I can give you is knowledge. Surely, I am not the only criminal whom you have an interest in. I know where Wyven is headed. Another thing is the bounty on my head. I'm sure that the bounty notices specify that only my ear needs to be brought back. If I let you have it, you can collect and still fulfill your sense of duty. I'll miss my ear, but not the damned prison tattoo.~ /*If I let you have it, you can collect and still fulfill your sense of duty. I'll miss my ear, but not the damned prison tattoo.*/
@9 = ~That sounds like a deal.~
@10 = ~I've made a decision. It's time to die.~
@11 = ~I have no interest in this anymore. I'm leaving.~
@12 = ~So you know about me. It appears that, try as I might, I cannot escape my past and I will never have freedom.~
@13 = ~Your past? Freedom? What do you mean?~
@14 = ~I'm not here to talk. It's time for you to die.~
@15 = ~Truly, you do not know? Well, far be it from me to tip my hand too early! And rightly said, I wouldn't worry over it if I were you. Now, whatever the reasons that brought about our conflict, let us put them to the side and continue on our merry way. Sound fair?~ /*Truly, you do not know? Well, far be it from me to tip my hand too early! And rightly said, I wouldn't worry over it if I were you.*/
@16 = ~I cannot let you leave until I know the full story.~
@17 = ~No. I want the truth, or I kill you.~
@18 = ~Uh, yeah... okay. I'll leave you alone.~
@19 = ~You won't find me so easy to kill!~
@20 = ~All right. One swift cut of the blade and - Augh!...~ [STHFE07]
@21 = ~As for... Wyvern... Yesgar told me... that he grew up in the Neverwinter Wood. Says the animals there... will protect him. Now, if you don't mind... I've got some bleeding to staunch.~ /*As for... Wyvern... Yesgar told me... that he grew up in the Neverwinter Wood. Says the animals there... will protect him.*/
@22 = ~Fine, I see I will never have any rest from the likes of you. Come at me, then, and end this!~
@23 = ~You would... just leave? I don't even know what to say. Somehow, "thank you" doesn't seem fitting to me. Perhaps "farewell" will do the trick.~
@24 = ~I was locked away in prison many years ago. I will not defend my past, and yes, I understand what I did was despicable. Not that I really cared. I did it, it helped me to get by... So I escaped prison. Perhaps, if I could, I'd go back to my old life, perhaps I'd start over anew. To me, it matters little. Just to be free from that prison, so I thought, would be the difference.~ /*Perhaps, if I could, I'd go back to my old life, perhaps I'd start over anew. To me, it matters little. Just to be free from that prison, so I thought, would be the difference.*/
@25 = ~You're free now. How did you manage to escape?~
@26 = ~I think I've heard enough, convict. Time to die.~
@27 = ~Well, that seems rather blunt. But who am I to quibble? And who knows? Perhaps you'll see my story delivered to a bard, if you aren't one yourself.~
@28 = ~Truly, you are a curious one. You seek to know every detail, it seems!~
@29 = ~Perhaps you feel a kinship with me sister. It often seems like this is a man's world. No matter, let me continue with my story.~
@30 = ~Perhaps there is something else you desire about me, besides my pretty little head. No matter, let me continue with my story.~
@31 = ~In prison I met up with some other inmates. A half-breed led them by the name of Yesgar. Like me, they were looking for a way out.~
@32 = ~Who were the other inmates?~
@33 = ~I've heard enough of this. Time to die.~
@34 = ~The others were named Stirge, Zor, and the prissy Wyvern. We all had our tasks. I was to deal with the guards.~
@35 = ~Go on.~
@36 = ~You're nothing but a common criminal. Time for you to die.~
@37 = ~We all escaped without a hitch. We escaped the most secure prison in all of Waterdeep! Even if you decide to kill me where I stand, I will be remembered for that. Surely by now you can have no further questions. So tell me, have you made a decision as to what you will do with me?~ /*We all escaped without a hitch. We escaped the most secure prison in all of Waterdeep! Even if you decide to kill me where I stand, I will be remembered for that.*/
@38 = ~What would you give me to spare your life?~
@39 = ~An intruder! Die, fool!~ [NWDELI58]
@40 = ~Haven't you caused me enough trouble?~ [NWDELI57]
