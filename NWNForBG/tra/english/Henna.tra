@0 = ~Hello there. My name is Henna. May I guide you along nature's path today?~
@1 = ~What do you mean?~
@2 = ~MT: Certainly. May I ask you a few questions?~ /*"Can I ask you some questions?"*/
@3 = ~Only if it leads to a city. I can't stand nature.~
@4 = ~Nature has paths that we walk everyday. Some paths are more dangerous than others. Guiding you to the right path is my duty in life, just as others have guided me.~
@5 = ~All right then, guide me by answering some questions.~
@6 = ~What kind of people have guided you in the past?~
@7 = ~I don't see why that would be a duty.~
@8 = ~What questions would you like answered?~
@9 = ~What's going on here?~
@10 = ~What do you do around here?~
@11 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@12 = ~MT: Everything is clear to me. Goodbye.~ /*That is all. Goodbye.*/
@13 = ~MT: Then your path is very sad and empty. What questions do you want answered?~ /*What questions would you like answered?*/
@14 = ~There have been many, including Aawill, the Archdruid and Jaer, Aawill's second-in-command. There have been... others, as well. But that is really none of your concern.~
@15 = ~Why are you suddenly so uptight? I was just trying to be polite.~
@16 = ~Fine. Maybe you could answer some other questions.~
@17 = ~Is that what you meant by guiding me down the right path? Telling me to mind my own business?~
@18 = ~Whatever. Goodbye.~
@19 = ~When other people help you out, it becomes your duty to help others. At least that is what others have taught me, and I believe it.~
@20 = ~MT: Most of all, we are now worried about the misfortune that happened to the Spirit of the Forest. These days, anyone who passes through the forest or near it is in danger. And no one really understands what's going on. I think Archdruid Aaville knows more about this. I only hear rumors. If you want facts, talk to Aaville.~ /*The biggest problem we face right now is the trouble with the Spirit of the Wood. Anyone travelling near or through the woods is in danger right now. No one is exactly sure what is going on.*/
@21 = ~What kind of rumors?~
@22 = ~I am the defender for the third circle of the grove. I also act as a counselor for troubled minds.~
@23 = ~What sort of counselor?~
@24 = ~What do you mean defender?~
@25 = ~Let me ask you another question.~
@26 = ~MT: If you mean general guidance, then it's Archdruid Aaville. However, those who are about to pass the tests for a place in the druid circle should speak with Jaer. Anything else?~ /*That depends on what you want. If you mean overall, then Aawill the Archdruid is in charge. If you refer to the challenges for entrance into the druid circle, however, then you should speak to Jaer. Anything else?*/
@27 = ~Be careful. There is always danger and the potential for tragedy on the paths you walk.~
@28 = ~I'm sorry, I shouldn't have snapped like that. You just touched on a sore topic. I just don't like people prying into my past.~
@29 = ~I understand, but sometimes it helps to share your pain.~
@30 = ~That's okay. Why don't you just answer a different question?~
@31 = ~Missing druids, evil spirits, angry gods - you name it, people have speculated about it. None of it is worth repeating. You should talk to Aawill.~
@32 = ~Just as I needed guidance in the past, so too do others. I try to assist them when they have difficulties.~
@33 = ~MT: A druid from our grove can summon me, but only if he enters the fourth circle and has enough experience. The duels are led by Jaer, but you are unlikely to be able to challenge one of our druids to a duel, you are strangers here. Is there anything else I can help you with?~ /*A druid may challenge me, but only if they are a member of the fourth circle and have sufficient experience. You should speak to Jaer if you have further questions about the challenges. Is there anything else I can help you with?*/
@34 = ~Maybe you're right. You seem trustworthy. I was the spoiled child of a noble family. When I turned twelve I decided that my parents' rules were too strict, so I ran away from home. I knew nothing of the world and all its dangers.~
@35 = ~For food, I began to pawn some jewelry that I had brought with me. The first piece brought me more than I had expected, so like a fool I ran out and stayed at an expensive inn, eating and drinking like a queen. The next day I woke up to find everything was gone.~
@36 = ~That's terrible. What did you do?~
@37 = ~That happens a lot, especially to foolish people.~
@38 = ~MT: I lived on the streets, ate leftovers in inns, and slept in an abandoned shack with the rest of the tramps until Kend found me. Kend was a druid, he saw me on the street. He felt sorry for such a young, unfortunate creature, and he persuaded me to go with him, took me under his wing as a ward. When I grew up, I fell in love with him, and he fell in love with me.~ /*I was living on the street, eating scraps from inns and sleeping in an old shanty with some other homeless people, until Kend found me. Kend was a druid who saw me on the street.*/
@39 = ~Yes, I was foolish. But then, most young people are. We make bad choices and we pay the penalty. My path was dificult, but not the worst.~
@40 = ~He taught me the ways of nature and how to choose the right path. We spent many years together. He... he died last year and I buried him in the woods. I hope that someone helps save the Spirit soon. I would like to go and visit his grave again.~
@41 = ~What do you mean, the Spirit?~
@42 = ~Maybe you could answer some other questions now?~
@43 = ~Thank you for telling me your story. Take care and farewell.~
@44 = ~The Spirit of the Wood is causing creatures to attack anyone in or near the forest. You should talk to Aawill if you are interested in helping.~
@45 = ~I see you have returned. What may I do for you?~
@46 = ~MT: You agreed to help our forest? This is a difficult task, good luck to you. May Silvanus be with you.~ /*Better safe than sorry. Have a potion, then, and Tyr be with you.*/
@47 = ~MT: Thanks to you, our forest is living its former life again. Thank you, may luck always be with you!~ /*You haven't saved me yet. I'll thank you when you have.*/
@48 = ~MT: Thanks to you, our forest is alive again, and I can finally go to Kend's grave. Thank you, may luck always be with you!~ /*The leopard swishes its tail agitatedly and watches you with wary eyes, obviously not caring for your presence.*/
@49 = ~MT: The spirit of the forest is dead! Our forest will never be the same, this is a huge loss!~ /*I work on a farm and I never expected to see someone who is dirtier than me!*/
