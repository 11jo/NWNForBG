@0 = ~Please, you must help me!~ [WYVERN61]
@1 = ~MT: I have already lost a fellow tracker in this place because of the animals. He lies not far from here, come with me, I'll show you.~ [WYVERN65] /*I have already lost a fellow ranger to the animals in this place. He lies just down the southern path.*/
@2 = ~You have made short work of my creatures. 'Twould not be wise to let you do the same to me.~ [WYVERN64]
@3 = ~Who are you?~
@4 = ~No deals. I'm here for your death.~
@5 = ~Wyvern, formerly a 'guest' of the Bulwark Prison in Waterdeep, at your service.~
@6 = ~Why did you ambush me?~
@7 = ~I intend to claim the bounty on you.~
@8 = ~Actually, I don't care to know who you are. Let us fight!~
@9 = ~If it must be this way, I shall not fall easily! Die!~
@10 = ~MT: Nothing personal. I thought you were a bounty hunter, going to kill me or send me back to this hellish prison. I'd rather kill myself than go back to this horrible place! For ten years I did not feel the sun on my face, did not hear the voice of the thicket. I am a tracker, and for me this is a real hell.~ /*I would sooner kill myself then go back to that horrible prison! For ten years I felt not the sun on my face nor heard the call of wild. I am a ranger and for me, it was truly hell.*/
@11 = ~Now I am free and back where I belong. I want nothing more than to be left alone and never again shall the rank stench of so-called civilization assail my senses.~
@12 = ~Why were you originally imprisoned?~
@13 = ~Why should I listen to anything that you say?~
@14 = ~I want your ear, Wyvern.~
@15 = ~Enough talk, Wyvern. It's time for you to die.~
@16 = ~I do not wish to die. The bounty requires only that you bring back my ear. I can also assist you in finding one of the other escapees.~
@17 = ~What do you propose?~
@18 = ~You want make deal?~
@19 = ~MT: I was born in the woods in the east. My father was a fairly famous tracker and he taught me to love the forest and all its inhabitants. Life was wonderful, although it did not last long. People came to the forest. Human mercenaries who left the service of some lord of the human lands west of the forest. They burned part of the forest, killed animals for fun, and crucified my father on a tree when he came to talk to them.~ /*Men came to the forest. Human mercenaries on leave from their employ with the lord of the human lands west of the forest. They burned part of the forest, slaughtered the animals for sport, and crucified my father on a tree when he came to speak with them.*/
@20 = ~Go on.~
@21 = ~There is a bounty on myself and the four who escaped with me. Hear me out and perhaps you may profit from it.~
@22 = ~I'll give you my ear if you'll allow me to leave. Tell them I'm dead, and let me become a recluse. I'll go into the wild and never return.~
@23 = ~So be it. I agree.~
@24 = ~Agreed, but only if you help me find the other escapees.~
@25 = ~No deal, you disgusting murderer! I'll kill you now!~
@26 = ~MT: When my father did not return, my mother went to look for him. I found her dead at the foot of the tree my father was hanging from. She was... abused before she was killed. My father was still alive and could only watch helplessly as my mother was killed. He died in my arms, and I swore revenge.~ /*When my father did not return, my mother went to search for him. I found her dead at the foot of the tree where my father hung. She had been... brutalized before they killed her.*/
@27 = ~Then what happened?~
@28 = ~Here, this arrow tip be sharp enough... Szzhgah, that stings... There, a single ear. Don't spend it all in one place.~ [RAGEF03]
@29 = ~Now, if you don't mind, I've got a poultice to prepare for where my ear used to be.~
@30 = ~As for my partners, I barely spoke to most of them. However, I do know that Zor is an idiot and has likely drowned himself in an ale barrel at the Green Griffon Inn. It was to be his first stop.~
@31 = ~MT: I tracked them down. One by one I found them and killed them. I killed their families. I killed their horses and dogs, stupid creatures that remained loyal to these people despite everything they did. When the human lord threw his troops against me, I hid in the forests and shot people with my bow until the survivors began to call this forest cursed - they were so afraid of it.~ /*I hunted them down. One by one I found them and killed them. I killed their families. I killed their dogs and their horses, stupid beasts that remained loyal to these men despite what they had done.*/
@32 = ~You were captured?~
@33 = ~Your crimes sicken me! Die!~
@34 = ~MT: I was betrayed by one of my own. A tracker from the west they hired. He tracked me down and didn't listen to my excuses. He spoke of the death of innocents and that revenge had gone too far. He did not understand. They grabbed me and took me to jail. There was no trial, and only the intervention of the tracker saved me from reprisals on the spot. But that was many years ago, and my anger has since subsided. I have avenged my father, and all I want is to roam the thickets and never see another settlement again.~ /*I was betrayed by one of my own. A ranger who they hired from the west. He tracked me down and would not listen to reason. He talked of innocents killed and vengeance gone too far. He did not understand.*/
@35 = ~How did you escape?~
@36 = ~MT: I escaped with the help of other prisoners - Ezgar, Stirzh, Zor and Delilah. Under normal circumstances, I wouldn't mess with such scum, but I desperately wanted to get out of there. I just couldn't stay in that cell any longer, out of touch with nature. I have no regrets about my actions and went to prison undeservedly.~ /*I escaped with the aid of other inmates Yesgar, Stirge, Zor, and Delilah. Typically, they were not the type I would associate with, but I was desperate to escape.*/
@37 = ~You don't wish to die and you want to make a deal?~
@38 = ~That's nice, but I'm here for the bounty.~
@39 = ~Indeed! This need not end in battle. Perhaps you'll allow me to make a suggestion? The bounty is for my ear.~
@40 = ~You have what you want, just leave me be.~ [WYVERN60]
