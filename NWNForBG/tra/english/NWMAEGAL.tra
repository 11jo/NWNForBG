@2 = ~I will meet your challenge. Speak it.~
@3 = ~I apologize for disturbing you. I will leave.~
@4 = ~I do not jump through hoops! Defend yourself!~
@5 = ~So be it. Show your knowledge of my legacy. The clan of my siblings, now dust, just as I... What was it called?~

@18 = ~You are doing that on purpose! Do not mock my fate! Quest for my answer and be rewarded! Taunt me again and suffer further!~
@19 = ~Quest for the legacy I left. Know the glory of my lost kingdom and you shall have what is mine. Now burn, and learn of your failure.~
@20 = ~It's... it's not stupid, it's a good one. See, it ensures that you quested to know what I have done, and are therefore worthy of what is mine.~
