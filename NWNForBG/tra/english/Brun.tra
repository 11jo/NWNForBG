@0 = ~Grrrr. Get out of my cave...~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I am Bran, from Port Llast - at one time normal, not afflicted with this... grrr... lycanthropic disease. Why don't you take your sneering self away from here?~
@3 = ~MT: Newrick gave me these silver charms. I think this will help you.~ /*Neurik gave me these silver charms. I think they can help you.*/
@4 = ~Tell me how you became a werewolf.~
@5 = ~MT: I have to end the werewolves. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will look for you again.~ /*I've been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.*/
@6 = ~Look, sit tight, okay? I'll see if I can find help for you.~
@7 = ~Have you dug your grave, lycanthrope? It's time to die.~
@8 = ~Grrrr... silver? You're trying to kill me, aren't you?~
@9 = ~Don't be shy, handsome - it won't hurt you.~
@10 = ~Nonsense. Neurik made it and, if you can't trust him, you can't trust anyone.~
@11 = ~Look, kid. Take it or I *will* kill you. It's that simple.~
@12 = ~All right, kid, dig your grave.~
@13 = ~MT: I went here on an expedition, Sir Caratis and a few friends, Urt, Ender, and Goth, were on it. We hunted - grrr - werewolves. The battle, of course, did not turn out the way we expected. Caratis became a werewolf - or he was killed. I don't know. And I don't want to know. The rest of us fled. Only Ender escaped the fate of a werewolf.~ /*The battle, of course, didn't fare as we expected. Karathis became a werewolf, or was killed. I don't know. Or care. The rest of us fled. Only Ander escaped becoming a werewolf.*/
@14 = ~Do you know where I can find Urth?~
@15 = ~Would you know where would I find Geth?~
@16 = ~Where is Karathis now?~
@17 = ~Let's talk about something else.~
@18 = ~My adventuring ring? Grrrr. You mean you won't kill me if I just give it to you?~
@19 = ~I won't kill you. I promise.~
@20 = ~Grrr... if you insist...~
@21 = ~Grrrr... take it back to Neurik, then, and tell him I'm dead or cured or something. Just leave me and my cave alone, all right?~
@22 = ~Grrrr... I died when I became this - beast. This battle can only end my misery.~
@23 = ~No one's called me handsome before... grrrr. Give me one of those charms, then. I ain't scared of it...~
@24 = ~Grrr... Neurik's been good to me since I was a baby, hasn't he... all right, give me one of those charms...~
@25 = ~Exactly - I can't trust anyone. Grrrr... Now back off.~
@26 = ~I don't care. I'm killing you now.~
@27 = ~Grrrr, you think I'm scared of death... give me the charm, then, and I'll prove it to you.~
@28 = ~Urth was running back to Port Llast. I tried to stop him, but - I just didn't want to see anyone from Port Llast hurt.~
@29 = ~Geth? No... I don't know where he got to, if he managed to get anywhere that is.~
@30 = ~I don't know where Karathis is, but I would hunt him down if I did. He ruined my life. This isn't even a life. Not anymore.~
@31 = ~What did you want to talk about?~
@32 = ~It - It worked, I can feel it. Thank you so much. Here, take my ring and bring it to Neurik so he knows I'm all right!~
@33 = ~Yuck, this place smells horrible! I'm going to get some fresh air, all right?~
@34 = ~It - It worked, I can feel it! I never thought I would be normal again, but - you proved me wrong!~
@35 = ~Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can't control... Myself!~
@36 = ~MT: I have silver charms from Newrick.~ /*I have silver charms - from Neurik.*/
@37 = ~I'll try to find some help for you. Stay here.~
@38 = ~I'm here to kill you, Geth. Are you ready?~
@39 = ~MT: Please! Now I'm human again! Do not kill me!~ /*Please! I am myself again! Don't kill me!*/
