@0 = ~Oh? Over here! Oh, thank the - I thought I was going to die. Everytime they came close to me, their foul smells - I was so scared.~ [LEAH051]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Leah. My name is Leah. I was working on the farm when I was attacked by those beasts. They kidnapped me, and - oh...~
@4 = ~Leah! I need to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~I spoke with your husband, Leah. He thinks that you're dead.~
@6 = ~All right. It should be safe for you to get out of here, Leah.~
@7 = ~I didn't expect to find any prisoners. Can you get out on your own?~
@8 = ~I'll go make sure it's safe. Can you wait here? I'll come back.~
@9 = ~Please, don't go! I don't want to be left in here, not alone... I'm so scared. It's so dark...~
@10 = ~NP: What? What questions? What do you want to ask for?~ /*Oh? What kind of questions? What did you want to ask?*/
@11 = ~What can you tell me of these caves?~
@12 = ~Why did the monsters kidnap you?~
@13 = ~He does? He - oh... this has been so horrible. I just want to go home. Will you help me escape?~
@14 = ~NP: Certainly. You can leave, the path is clear.~ /*Then you are free to go. The way behind me is clear.*/
@15 = ~Thank you so much, kind <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I wish I could show you my appreciation. Please come and visit me and my husband when you are done here.~
@16 = ~I... I suppose I could, yes. You did kill the monsters that were guarding me, right?~
@17 = ~Yes. Just follow the trail of carnage and you'll be fine.~
@18 = ~You want me to... wait here? In this place? I guess I have no choice in the matter, but please hurry back! Please...~
@19 = ~NP: I dont even know... its very dark in here and I didnt see much. For the most part, they just kept me here and yelled at me. From time to time they dragged me outside and forced me to do something for them, most often to serve. And when I finished washing, sewing or something else, they brought me here again.~ /*I don't really know... it's pretty dark in here and I haven't been able to see too much. They generally just screamed at me and kept me in here.*/
@20 = ~You should get out of here now.~
@21 = ~NP: In my opinion, they just needed a servant. Nothing too hard or exhausting, really. But it didnt make it any easier for me... Im sick, tired and hungry... I cant sleep at all, and I just want to go back to my husband.~ /*Just to do some menial labor, it would seem. Nothing too heavy or exhausting, really. Though it didn't make this any easier on me...*/
@22 = ~I hate to keep asking questions, but did they mention anything?~
@23 = ~NP: Er... come to think of it... they said something about their &quot;master.&quot; For them it was something like a threat, they were afraid of him. And it seems that this owner somehow rewarded especially brave monsters. Well, at least thats how it seemed to me.~ /*Um... come to think of it... they mentioned something about their "master." It was more like a threat to them, though, to keep them in line.*/
@24 = ~Please! Don't leave me here again, I beg of you. My name is Leah. My husband must be so worried!~ [LEAH054]
@25 = ~(sob) I miss my family!~ [LEAH050]
@26 = ~NP: Wait here? Ill be back soon.~ /*"Wait here until I return."*/
@27 = ~Thank you so much for all you have done!~ [LEAH056]
