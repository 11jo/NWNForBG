@0 = ~NP: Welcome friend. I am Yusam, a druid from the north, mediator between the Lords' Alliance and the Uthgardts. If you want, you can rest in this grove, it's calm here. Or do you need me for some other reason?~ [YUSAM63] /*You are free to take solace in the tranquility of my grove, if you wish. Or is there some other reason you have sought me out?*/
@1 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I work for Aarin Gend.~
@2 = ~What is a druid doing up here on this plateau?~
@3 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~I'd like to purchase some supplies.~
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~NP: When the Lords' Alliance set up camp here, Aarin told me that he was recruiting agents to search for ancient magical artifacts. I wish you the best of luck in your quest, although I already told Aarin that I'm more concerned about the state of the Uthgardts.~ /*When the Lords' Alliance set up camp here Aarin told me he was recruiting agents to search for lost artifacts of ancient magic.*/
@7 = ~Plight of the Uthgardt? What do you mean?~
@8 = ~This land and its people are under my protection and care. That is why the plight of the Uthgardt troubles me so. Their suffering is like a thorn in my heart.~
@9 = ~NP: Utgardt problems? What do you mean?~ /*Plight of the Uthgardt? What do you mean?*/
@10 = ~NP: I know all the ways of the life of the forest and the secrets of the changing seasons, but as far as worldly matters are concerned, my knowledge is very limited. I try not to let things like this disturb the tranquility of my grove. I will ask you to leave all your troubles outside when you enter here, my child. This place is a refuge for those who want to take a break from the outside world. Utgardts come here to forget for a while about the deplorable state of their people. You don't need to remind them of this.~ /*This place is a refuge from the outside world. The Uthgardt come so they might escape the plight of their people. They do not need you to remind them of such things.*/
@11 = ~You are welcome to see my stock, where you will find not only those treasures gathered from the glorious bounty of nature, but also those items oft-used by nature's servants.~
@12 = ~Go, child, and may a gentle breeze carry you safely to your destination, like the summer winds that bring seeds to replenish the eternal forest.~
@13 = ~My child, this war takes a terrible toll on the Uthgardt. The armies of Luskan lay waste to their lands and the Black Lion tribe has lost many warriors battling alongside the Lords' Alliance soldiers.~
@14 = ~And as I have already told you, the Elk tribe has aligned itself with the Luskan forces for reasons I cannot fathom.~
@15 = ~The Elk tribe are no more. I have slain their Chieftain.~
@16 = ~Commander Damas has infected the Elk tribe with the plague.~
@17 = ~Zokan, leader of the Elk tribe, asked me to show this dreamcatcher to you.~
@18 = ~But it is for the Uthgardt Elk tribe that I worry most of all. They have aligned themselves with the Luskan destroyers to slaughter the defenseless settlers around Fort Ilkard in the south.~
@19 = ~You're a druid. Can't you make them stop?~
@20 = ~NP: Alas, everything is as I thought. It was impossible to negotiate with Zokan, his tribe was infected with the evil of the Luskan troops. It pains me to hear this, but I thank you for this news. My child, you managed to solve this case for me. You deserve an award. I don't have much, but please accept this ring as a reward for your labors.~ /*Alas, it is as I feared. Zokan was not to be reasoned with, his tribe had fallen in with the evil of Luskan forces. I thank you for this news, though it brings me great pain to hear.*/
@21 = ~NP: Investigate the state of affairs in the Elk Tribe Zokan Thunderbolt, the leader of the Elk Tribe, is no more. Yusam, the druid of the North, was saddened to hear the news, but he realized that it was really necessary to destroy the Elk tribe.~ /*Zokan Thunderer, leader of the Elk tribe, is no more. Upon hearing the news Yusam, Druid of the North, was saddened, though he understood the necessity of the Elk tribe's destruction.*/
@22 = ~NP: Commander Damas is known for his cruelty, but even from him I did not expect such villainy! Alas, there is little I can do, I have no cure for the plague with me. But Damas is not stupid. If he infected the Elk tribe, he must have a cure in case one of his people gets infected. Maybe you can talk to Damas and try to convince him to give me the medicine. I'm afraid there is no other way to save the Elk tribe.~ /*Commander Damas is well known for his cruelty, but I did not suspect even he of such a vile act! Alas, there is little I can do as I have none of the plague cure with me.*/
@23 = ~I'll go speak to Damas at once!~
@24 = ~I looked into this like you asked. This your problem now, Yusam.~
@25 = ~NP: I recognize the sign of the Elk tribe. It is a symbol of peace and repentance. This should mean that Zokan is apologizing for everything his tribe has done. I will send my messengers again to mend relations with the people of the Elk. My child, you managed to solve this case for me. You deserve an award. I don't have much, but please accept this ring as a reward for your labors.~ /*I recognize this Elk tribe token. It is a symbol of truce and contrition. It must mean that Zokan is apologizing for what his tribe has done. I will send my emissaries at once to reestablish relations with the Elk people.*/
@26 = ~NP: Investigate the status of the Elk Tribe The Elk Tribe have recovered from the plague that Commander Damas sent to them from Fort Ilkard, and they will no longer help Luskan's army in the battle against Neverwinter. The druid Yusam was glad to know that Elk's children would again respond to his instructions.~ /*The Elk tribe have been cured of the plague given to them by Commander Damas of Fort Ilkard, and will no longer aid the Luskan army in its battle against Neverwinter.
Yusam the Druid was pleased to learn the children of the Elk will once more welcome his counsel.*/
@27 = ~Once, the Elk tribe welcomed my counsel, but they have since turned their back on the way of nature. The emissaries I have sent to investigate have all been ruthlessly slain.~
@28 = ~May the blessings of my sacred grove be with you on this mission.~
@29 = ~NP: You have offered to help in this matter, my child, and the work is only half done. You can plant a seed, but it takes more than that for the tree to take root and grow. I have no one else to entrust this matter, my child. If you manage to help the Elk tribe, I promise you that the reward will not disappoint you.~ /*You offered your aid in this matter, my child, and the job is but half done. A seed can be planted, but that alone will not cause the tree to take root and grow.*/
@30 = ~Forget it.~
@31 = ~As a fellow servant of the forest and a true child of nature you can no doubt understand my distress.~
@32 = ~As a servant of nature I am honored to investigate this matter for you, Yusam of the Grove!~
@33 = ~I could help you with this... for a price.~
@34 = ~You are not a child of nature, so perhaps you cannot understand the pain I feel over what has happened with the Elk tribe.~
@35 = ~Perhaps I could investigate this for you, Yusam.~
@36 = ~NP: I cannot force you to help me, my child, although I hope in time the flower of mercy will bloom in your heart and make you change your mind. Is there anything else I can do for you, my child?~ /*I cannot force you to aid me in this matter, my child, though I hope in time the flower of charity will bloom in your heart and change your mind.*/
@37 = ~NP: This mission can be dangerous, my child. The Elk tribe killed everyone who tried to negotiate with them. But if you find out why the Elk tribe turned their backs on us, I will be very grateful to you. The Elk Tribe are now in their stronghold, west of Fort Ilkard, although they continue to raid the fort. Maybe you will go there, find them and talk to their leader, Zokan the Thunderer.~ /*The Elk tribe have fortified themselves inside their keep to the west of Fort Ilkard, although they continue to make raids on the fort. Perhaps if you go there you can find them and speak to Zokan Thunderer, their chief.*/
@38 = ~I'll be back when I learn more of the Elk tribe.~
@39 = ~In the natural cycle good deeds bring good deeds in return. Should you find a way to bring the Elk tribe back into the fold you will be showered with an abundant bounty of rewards.~
@40 = ~Your offer is generous, child. I cannot leave this grove, and there is nowhere else I may turn for aid. I fear, however, that you do not truly understand what you are about to undertake.~
@41 = ~NP: Investigate the state of affairs in the Elk Tribe Yusam needs someone who agrees to investigate the state of affairs in the Elk Tribe. The druid is convinced that there is some reason why they turned their backs on the Lords' Alliance and joined Luskan's army. Yusam thinks that the Elk tribe and their leader, Zokan the Thunderer, are based in a fortress to the west of Fort Ilkard.~ /*Yusam is looking for someone to investigate the Uthgardt Elk tribe. The druid is convinced there must be some reason they have turned away from the Lords' Alliance and joined with the Luskan army.
Yusam believes the Elk tribe and their leader, Zokan Thunderer, are in a keep to the west of Fort Ilkard.*/
@42 = ~It always pleases me when a fellow child of nature chooses to partake of the beauty of my grove.~ [YUSAM62]
@43 = ~Welcome, my child. Do you bring me news of the Uthgardt Elk tribe? Or is there some other purpose to your visit?~ [YUSAM60]
@44 = ~NP: Welcome my friend. I will always be grateful to you for your help in the Moose case. Are you here to escape the hustle and bustle of the world? Or is there another reason for your visit?~ [YUSAM59] /*Have you come here seeking a tranquil refuge from the outside world? Or is there perhaps some other reason for your visit?*/
@45 = ~NP: Good to see you again, my child. Are you here to enjoy the peace and privacy of the sacred grove? Or is there something else that makes you contact me again?~ [YUSAM61] /*Well met once again, my child. Have you come to enjoy the peace and solitude of my grove?*/
@46 = ~Who are you again?~
@47 = ~I am Yusam, Druid of the North. I am the liaison between the Lords' Alliance and the Uthgardt tribes.~
