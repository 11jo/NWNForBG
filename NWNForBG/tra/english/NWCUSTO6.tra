@0 = ~I think the plague is a result of the poor classes we allowed into the district. The barricades were long overdue.~
@1 = ~You don't belong among the nobles of Blacklake. What are you, another of Meldanen's thugs?~
@2 = ~Hello, you must be one of the new city guard. I wish you luck.~
@3 = ~NP: How are you doing? I think everything is in order at the barricades, and not a single patient will break through to us?~ /*How do you do, my <LADYLORD> guard? I trust everything is well at the barricades, and that no plagued sods will make it through?*/
@4 = ~The Wailing Death has claimed so many lives. Why do people like Meldanen have to make things worse?~
@5 = ~You'll have to pardon me. The plague has taken my desire for conversation.~
@6 = ~I hope a plague cure is found soon. The barricades can't keep everyone out.~
@7 = ~Stay away from me! You look like the sort that might carry the plague.~
@8 = ~A barbarian! I thought the barricades would have kept your kind out of our district. This is probably Meldanen's doing.~
@9 = ~I regret that the Blacklake must shut out the plagues and weak, but what choice do we have? Your gods do nothing.~
@10 = ~A proper member of society does not wander about with their weapon drawn.~
