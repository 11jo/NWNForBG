@0 = ~MT: The temperature today is just right for working in the field, isn't it,<LADYLORD> ?~ /*A good <DAYNIGHTALL> for field work, wouldn't you say, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?*/
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose you could. What is it you want to know, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@4 = ~I'm curious about some recent events...~
@5 = ~Anything interesting about these parts?~
@6 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@7 = ~Safe journeys, then. I'll be here in the fields if you ever feel like stopping by to chat.~
@8 = ~Aye, that seems a reasonable enough thing to ask after.~
@9 = ~That cult preying on Neverwinter - know anything about it?~
@10 = ~Actually I'm more interested in local affairs...~
@11 = ~How long have you farmed here?~
@12 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@13 = ~Oh, my father-in-law told me a few old tales from when he first cleared the land to settle here.~
@14 = ~Tell me one of your father-in-law's stories.~
@15 = ~Actually, I'm more interested in a job, if you know of anything.~
@16 = ~Are there any places you think I should visit?~
@17 = ~MT: I would like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@18 = ~Very well but mind that I've still got work that needs doing...~
@19 = ~MT: Where does the north road lead?~ /*Where does the west road lead?*/
@20 = ~Where does the east road lead?~
@21 = ~Is there a place where I might rest nearby?~
@22 = ~Hrmm... A week ago or so, my son said he met a seedy looking fellow heading into the Charwood. My son said hello and the man said some rude things. He's as good as gone, then, I suppose...~
@23 = ~MT: Well, what's so special about it?~ /*Well, this is special.*/
@24 = ~Did anything else stand out about him?~
@25 = ~MT: It's quiet around here, except that Pete O'Deal has problems with the wolves. The grass is growing, the wind is blowing, that's all our news... You still have questions, I see... Go ahead, spread it out.~ /*Other than Pete O'Deel's trouble with the wolves, it's been pretty quiet around these parts. Grass grows, wind blows, nothing much of consequence...*/
@26 = ~Who is Pete O'Deel?~
@27 = ~Trouble with wolves?~
@28 = ~Since I was a young man, I suppose. The farm came with the wife, bless her soul. Her parents homesteaded the place, but that's a story in itself...~
@29 = ~A story, is it? I'd love to hear it...~
@30 = ~What do you want to know?~
@31 = ~See where the field stops and the woods begin? My father-in-law said to... never... Oh, now of all the stories, what possessed me to tell this one?~
@32 = ~MT: Tell me. Nothing bad will happen from this.~ /*Just give me an overview of the area.*/
@33 = ~MT: Well, now that my boy has a little fun and finally went to the market, we are doing just fine. You can go to Pete O'Deal. They are pleasant people, and will gladly listen to the news from the city. Their girl, Constance, is a very pretty young lady.~ /*Maybe wander by Pete O'Deel's up on the south bluff, there. They're friendly enough folk and wouldn't mind hearing the latest news from town. Their girl, Constance, she's a nice lass.*/
@34 = ~MT: I don't know, I can't think of anything, unless you cheer up my boy, Eric. Looks like the O'Deal girl broke his heart, like I said. He locked himself in his room, “I need to think,” he says, and I’m already a little fed up with the work for him to pull. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Well, other than cheering up my boy Erik, I'm not sure what you could do. Seems that O'Deel lass has broken his heart just like I said.*/
@35 = ~MT: You can go to Pete O'Deal. They are pleasant people, and will gladly listen to the news from the city. Their girl, Constance, is a very pretty young lady.~ /*Maybe wander by Pete O'Deel's up on the south bluff, there. They're friendly enough folk and wouldn't mind hearing the latest news from town. Their girl, Constance, she's a nice lass.*/
@36 = ~MT: This one? Well, go along it, so in the end you will get to Port Llast. Besides me, there are few people who lay the track here, especially during the harvest. And if you drive further along this road, then you can get to Luskan, but it's a long way for me.~ /*That way? Take it long enough and you'll make it all the way to Port Llast. Most of the ruts along the way are mine, at least come harvest.*/
@37 = ~Well, now, that heads into the Charwood. Take my advice, though, you're better off thinking of my farm as the end of the road.~
@38 = ~How come?~
@39 = ~MT: Well, I would offer you to spend the night with me, but only my son has grown up, so now I have less space than before. Oh well, we'll fit in somehow.~ /*Well now, I'd offer you my place but my son's grown to the point where there's not the same room that there used to be.*/
@40 = ~MT: Devilish things are going on there, mark my words, son. This forest is full of ghosts, so understanding people stay away from it.~ /*Other than the fact that no one travels to Charwood, no. That forest is haunted so people who know generally steer clear.*/
@41 = ~Other than the fact that no one travels to Charwood, no. That forest is haunted so people who know generally steer clear.~
@42 = ~Pete is the farmer across the way. Mary and my wife were best friends from birth 'til the day she passed away. I've known the O'Deels since we first started courting. They're good folk. Pete's farm's been beset by wolves, lately.~
@43 = ~MT: Pete O'Deal has a farm east of here, he has a herd there. Wolves slaughter livestock almost every day.~ /*Just down the road, Pete O'Deel has a farm with a few head of cattle. A pack of wolves has been killing his cattle almost daily.*/
@44 = ~MT: Well, as they say, said A, say B too ... There are those trees, this is Charwood, people don’t live there ... You can cut down a hundred of these trees, and the next morning you wake up - and they are right there, standing intact, as if no one touched them. All is not well with these forests. They say that somewhere there is a village of lost souls, and the people who went there never returned...~ /*You can cut down a hundred of those trees but, when you wake up the next morning, they'll all be standing again like they'd never known the blade.*/
@45 = ~My father-in-law warned me never to go in there and I've told my boy the same. You'd be wise to do likewise... Now is there anything else?~
@46 = ~MT: What, lost your way, right, my friend?~ /*Out for a jaunt, are you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/
@47 = ~MT: Just try not to trample the crops. Is there anything I can do to help you?~ /*Mind you don't trample the corn, now.*/
