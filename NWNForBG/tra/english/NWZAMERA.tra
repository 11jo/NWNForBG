@0 = ~*Sigh* I wish we didn't have to come here so often, but since the plague, Billiam hasn't been able to take the boys hunting. Not that I mind... so much blood...~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Excuse me, I must be leaving.~
@3 = ~Oh, please no. I'm not in any mood to talk. It's bad enough I'm even here, but Billiam, he insists the children come.~
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~Who is Billiam? Why does he insist these children come here?~
@6 = ~What do you know of this place?~
@7 = ~Fare you well in this difficult time.~
@8 = ~My name is Lady Zemeria. I am just a citizen of the Blacklake. You'll forgive me if I don't feel like going into more detail? The troubles of the day weigh heavily on my mind.~
@9 = ~NP: Billyham is my husband. He can't get used to the plague. He probably feels helpless and doesn't want the children to feel the same way. He only means well, but I question his methods. I'm not really interested in this place.~ /*Billiam is my husband. He's not adjusting well to the plague. I imagine he feels helpless, and doesn't want the children to feel the same way.*/
@10 = ~If you don't like this place, why do you permit it to continue?~
@11 = ~NP: I know we come here too often. We've been here all day long. Billiam looks at the animals and remembers his old adventures. I guess we all benefit from memories when times get tough. I don't care what conditions the animals are kept in. I wouldn't be able to change a thing. This place is run by Montgomery Weatherson.~ /*I know we are here all too often. All hours of the day, it seems. Billiam looks at the animals and thinks of old conquests. I suppose we all have our retreats in hard times.*/
@12 = ~Are you acquainted with him?~
@13 = ~No, and I don't really care to. I am tolerant of my Billiam's rough edges, but I see no reason to go looking for others with a similar bent.~
@14 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@15 = ~NP: I don't know if you realize who I am. I don't have that kind of power. A lot of people like the zoo. Many will oppose its closure. Druid Niatar has made attempts to change things, but now that everyone's attention is on the plague, I guess no one cares about the animals.~ /*The druid Nyatar had begun talks to make changes, but now that the plague has everyone's attention I guess the animals don't seem that important.*/
@16 = ~I will see this place shut down!~
@17 = ~Will you, now? I won't be particularly sad to see it go. I won't get involved, however. I have enough to worry about, as it is.~
