@0 = ~I am undone... take your bow, friend. You have your traitor. What now, I wonder?~ [NWDES161]
@1 = ~You will be taken back to face judgment.~
@2 = ~I should end your life right now.~
@3 = ~You will have to explain yourself, Desther.~
@4 = ~Yes, Nasher will want me alive, won't he? He'll want reasons and justification. He'll want a villain to give to the mob. I suppose I'll be executed eventually, if just to ease the fears of the people, but it will do nothing. There is so much more to come. So little you understand.~ /*Yes, Nasher will want me alive, won't he? He'll want reasons and justification. He'll want a villain to give to the mob.*/
@5 = ~And what would that prove? No, Nasher will want me alive. He'll want reasons and justification. He'll want a villain to give to the mob. I suppose I'll be executed eventually, if just to ease the fears of the people, but it will do nothing. There is so much more to come. So little you understand.~ /*And what would that prove? No, Nasher will want me alive. He'll want reasons and justification. He'll want a villain to give to the mob.*/
@6 = ~You have questions, of course, but I don't have answers. I will not give you that satisfaction, nor will I give it to the mob that awaits in Neverwinter. Your victory shall be hollow.~
@7 = ~Where the cure?~
@8 = ~Who you serve?~
@9 = ~Why was Neverwinter attacked? Why did you spread the plague?~
@10 = ~What about Fenthick? Your trickery may damn him, too.~
@11 = ~Of course, the cure. Don't you worry. It is here. Not that it matters. The plague would have ended soon enough without my False Helmites spreading it. You may save a few of the worst cases, I suppose, but the damage is already done. The plague has sapped the strength of the city. It did what was intended.~ /*Of course, the cure. Don't you worry. It is here. Not that it matters. The plague would have ended soon enough without my False Helmites spreading it.*/
@12 = ~I have the cure. When you return me to Lord Nasher, the cure will be delivered as well. No need to scramble about searching. I have no more reason to defy you now.~
@13 = ~Shut up. I'm going to look around this place before I take you back.~
@14 = ~Enough! I'm taking you back to Neverwinter right now!~
@15 = ~We are the People of the Eye. We are the ones who follow. We are the servants of the Old Ones, and you are merely cattle! You cannot understand!~
@16 = ~What are the Old Ones! Tell me!~
@17 = ~How big is your group? How many "People of the Eye" are there?~
@18 = ~Why is anything ever attacked? To weaken it, and strengthen the attacker. Neverwinter is a shadow of its former glory - glory undeserved! You will see! It was an honor to spread the great disease! It has bled you dry and now feeds your destruction! The souls of your dead will bring my masters to power!~ /*Why is anything ever attacked? To weaken it, and strengthen the attacker. Neverwinter is a shadow of its former glory - glory undeserved!*/
@19 = ~If you did not start the plague, who did?~
@20 = ~Explain what you mean! What did the plague do?~
@21 = ~Good! Let the plague-suffering citizens call out for blood! Let them demand the harshest penalties! What do I care! Fenthick was the perfect tool, so willing to trust in the faith of another. Now he looks like a conspirator, or at the very least, dangerously negligent. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what does it do to a people when they turn on the best among them? They shall see traitors everywhere now. Their spirit will weaken even further.~ /*Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what does it do to a people when they turn on the best among them? They shall see traitors everywhere now. Their spirit will weaken even further.*/
@22 = ~Ever the mercenary. By all means, loot what you must. I am quite incapacitated. Come talk to me when you want to leave. I'm sure Lord Nasher is waiting.~
@23 = ~Don't rush on my account. I know what awaits me. My fate is sealed. There's comfort in that. It is better, I'll wager, than the uncertainty awaiting you.~
@24 = ~Save your wrath, you will get no satisfaction from me. I cannot explain it to you. Does the ant understand the wagon rolling above? Does the boar understand the arrow piercing through? You cannot comprehend my masters, and I will not speak for them. Let your saber rattle, let Nasher bring his interrogators - you will get nothing from me.~ /*Save your wrath, you will get no satisfaction from me. I cannot explain it to you. Does the ant understand the wagon rolling above? Does the boar understand the arrow piercing through?*/
@25 = ~We are legion, always growing in number. In the end, all who wish to survive will become as we. Move with the tide or be drowned within it. You have routed my False Helmites, but we will be replaced. Our job is finished here - our loss will not be felt.~ /*We are legion, always growing in number. In the end, all who wish to survive will become as we. Move with the tide or be drowned within it.*/
@26 = ~I will say nothing! You are like a child, begging for explanations but understanding nothing. You are doomed, and there is nothing you can do! You will see!~
@27 = ~I have other questions.~
@28 = ~You delay in returning me to Nasher and the precious Lady Aribeth. Hurry with your looting and let this farce come to an end.~ [NWDES162]
