@23 = ~After ssslaying a dragon, a group of knightsss gave sssome of the trinketsss from a treasure horde to a group of fewer than ten human girlsss to divide. While the trinketsss could have been divided equally amongssst the girlsss, they argued over how to divide it. One sssuggesssted that they divide it by family inssstead of by individual. In the group, there were two groupsss of two sssisssterss, the ressst unrelated.~ 
@24 = ~This division would mean that the trinketsss per family were five more than the trinketsss per girl. Before a decision was made, one girl sssaid she desired nothing. Ssso her share wasss divided amongssst the othersss. The sharesss were equal once again.~ 
@25 = ~The sssuggestion of dividing the trinketsss by family wasss then withdrawn, asss all were sssatisfied. How many girlsss shared in the division and how many did each get?~

@36 = ~Sssss! You are correct! Here isss your gift! Now begone!!~
