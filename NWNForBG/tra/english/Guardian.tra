@0 = ~Greetings, Judge, and welcome to the Castle Jhareg... I hope you have learned your lessons well.~ [GUARD050]
@1 = ~Why do you call me Judge?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~What is this place? Who is Lord over this castle?~
@4 = ~Why do you haunt this place, Spirit?~
@5 = ~I call you by what you are and what you may yet be, my child. Lathander, god of the dawn, has waited long for you.~
@6 = ~I am a divine spirit sent by the god Lathander to watch over this place until the day of Judgment. And now that day has come...~
@7 = ~This castle was once home to the brothers Jhareg. Now it stands trapped in time by Lathander, god of the dawn, in anticipation of your coming.~
@8 = ~NP: I am no ordinary ghost, though there is no shortage of ghosts in these halls..... I am a divine spirit sent by the god Latander to watch over this place until the day of judgment. And that day has come.~ /*I am a divine spirit sent by the god Lathander to watch over this place until the day of Judgment. And now that day has come...*/
@9 = ~Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...~
@10 = ~Tell me more...~
@11 = ~Get to the point, will you?~
@12 = ~NP: It was a mortal crime, and a mortal was to be the judge. And so this castle and the village around it have been withdrawn from the flow of time to await your arrival. The accused are imprisoned in the towers outside the north door. They are known as the brothers Jareg, Carlat in the west tower and Quintus in the east tower.~ /*It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival.*/
@13 = ~NP: You are the judge. I'll open the doors for you, examine the castle. When you have affidavits from both Jareg brothers, bring them to me to begin the trial.~ /*You are the Judge. Take this key and explore the castle. When you obtain the written oaths of the brothers Jhareg, present them to me so you may stand in Judgment.*/
@14 = ~I have some questions first, Spirit.~
@15 = ~Very well. I shall return to you with the oaths.~
@16 = ~I'm not your Judge and I'm *not* visiting your stupid towers!~
@17 = ~NP: You must find out from both of them what their crime was and get written oaths from them. When the oaths are in my hands, I will hear your sentence. I will open doors for you, behind which you will find staircases to both towers. Show wisdom, judge, and compassion for all of us....~ /*You must learn from them the nature of the crime and from them obtain their written oath. When both oaths are in my hands, I shall hear your Judgment.*/
@18 = ~Then ask them and I shall answer as Lathander gives me leave.~
@19 = ~Quint's one of the accused? Didn't I see him earlier?~
@20 = ~What is this crime over which I stand in Judgment?~
@21 = ~Will you accept any Judgment? Any at all?~
@22 = ~What if I choose to kill the brothers Jhareg?~
@23 = ~All right, enough questions.~
@24 = ~Then go into the night, dear Judge, and find the dawn we have awaited for so long.~
@25 = ~NP: Charwood: Village of Eternal Night.

The strange village of Charwood is tucked away in the wilds of the forest that bears the same name. It is surrounded by a wall of thick blue fog, making it seem as if it is always night. In the village itself, the fog seems to have clouded the minds of the villagers, as they keep repeating the same things, shivering in the icy night air.

Inside the castle, the traveler is greeted by a spirit guardian who declares that Latander has given this place the ability to slip through the fabric of time, waiting for someone to bring justice to two brothers, Quintus and Carlat Jareg They are rumored to have committed a terrible crime that must not be told. Carlat is imprisoned in the west tower, and Quintus is most likely in the east tower. Whoever wishes to execute Justice must learn all he can about the case, get written confessions from the two brothers, and show them to the guardian spirit.~ /*The strange village of Charwood is buried deep within the forest that shares its name. It is shrouded by sheets of deep blue mist and seems to exist beneath a pall of endless night. At the entrance, a madman by the name of Quint greets newcomers with riddles before disappearing in a puff of blood-drenched smoke. Inside the village proper, the townsfolk seem to be lost in a haze of confusion and forgetfulness, repeating their words endlessly into the chill night air. The Mayor is no different, though he seems frightened by the prospect of anyone entering the forboding Castle Jhareg which looms over the settlement's north edge.
Inside the castle, one is met with three doors and but a single key. A note tied to the key speaks of Judgment and suggests that the three doors represent three different paths of Justice. Further in, one is met by a Guardian Spirit who claims that Lathander, god of the morning, has allowed this place to slip between the weave of time, pending the arrival of someone willing to stand in Judgment over the two brothers, Quint and Karlat Jhareg, who are said to have been involved in some horrendous, though unspoken crime. Karlat is said to be confined within the western tower while Quint, the madman at the gate, is supposedly confined within the eastern tower. Whoever wishes to stand in Judgment must learn what facts they can of the case, obtain the written oaths of these two brothers, and present them to the Guardian Spirit.*/
@26 = ~As you wish. We have waited this long without a dawn. We shall wait forever if we must. If you are not the Judge, the Judge shall come.~
@27 = ~NP: Before darkness enveloped the castle, Quintus Jareg had been a priest of Latander. When the Lord of Morning sealed the towers, he allowed Quintus to leave his image in the village below. Perhaps the ghosts of the village were meant to be a special punishment for Quintus, or perhaps they were meant to soothe the pain of a wounded soul.~ /*Before the dark befell this castle, Quint Jhareg was Lathander's cleric. When the Morninglord sealed the towers, he allowed Quint to project an image of himself into the town below.*/
@28 = ~Lathander either loves or hates his fallen cleric. Either way, the Morninglord knew he held too great a bias to stand in Judgment over Quint's soul.~
@29 = ~By Lathander's will, I cannot say. In telling you of the horror, I might sway your Judgment. No, you must learn of it from the brothers themselves...~
@30 = ~How many Judgments can there be? There is guilt and there is innocence and consequences for them both.~
@31 = ~NP: You have no power in this place. The castle slips through the waves of time. Once they die, they will be reborn. Only I have the power to bring this place back into the flow of time, and I cannot exercise that power until the judge pronounces judgment.~ /*Only I have the power to bring this place back into the weave and it is a power I cannot use until the Judge provides his Judgment.*/
@32 = ~Then do you accept the role of Judge and the task of Judgment?~
@33 = ~Greetings, Judge. Do you bring with you the oaths of the brothers Jhareg?~ [GUARD051]
@34 = ~Yep.~
@35 = ~No.~
@36 = ~Oaths? What oaths?~
@37 = ~Can you refresh my memory about what's going on here?~
@38 = ~Which oaths do you bear?~
@39 = ~Both Quint's and Karlat's.~
@40 = ~Quint's.~
@41 = ~Karlat's.~
@42 = ~Sorry, I was mistaken. I don't have either.~
@43 = ~Then come speak with me once you do.~
@44 = ~Ah, then perhaps you are not familiar with the sad tale of Castle Jhareg.~
@45 = ~Of course, Judge. You need but ask...~
@46 = ~NP: This castle once belonged to the Jareg brothers. Now it has been turned into a time trap by Latander, god of the dawn, awaiting your arrival. Long ago, a crime was committed here, and the consequences were so terrible that Latander himself felt unable to bring judgment upon these accused....~ /*Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...*/
@47 = ~NP: It was a mortal crime, and a mortal was to be the judge. And so this castle and the village around it have been withdrawn from the flow of time to await your arrival. The accused are imprisoned in the towers outside the north door. They are known as the brothers Jareg, Carlat in the west tower and Quintus in the east tower.~ /*It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival.*/
@48 = ~Thank you. Are you prepared to stand in Judgment?~
@49 = ~Yes, I am ready.~
@50 = ~No, I still need time to think about it.~
@51 = ~Then that is both of them. Are you prepared to stand in Judgment?~
@52 = ~Then I shall hold it for you and keep it safe until you return with his brother's.~
@53 = ~Wise is the Judge who gives thought to his Judgment. Speak with me again when you are ready.~
@54 = ~Quint and Karlat Jhareg, I summon you unto the court of Judgment.~
@55 = ~I hold the oaths of the brothers Jhareg and this court requires only the presence of a Judge. Are you ready to stand in Judgment?~ [GUARD052]
@56 = ~Judgment? I don't understand what's going on.~
@57 = ~NP: Ah, then perhaps you are still unfamiliar with the sad history of Jareg Castle. This castle once belonged to the Jareg brothers. Now it has been turned into a time trap by Latander, the God of Dawn, awaiting your arrival. Long ago, a crime was committed here, and the consequences were so terrible that Latander himself felt unable to execute judgment on these accused... It was the crime of mortals, and mortal was to be the judge. And so this castle and the village around it have been withdrawn from the flow of time to await your arrival.~ /*Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...*/
@58 = ~NP: The accused are imprisoned in their towers. They are known as the brothers Jareg, Carlat in the western tower and Quintus in the eastern tower. You must find out from both of them what their crime was and obtain written oaths from them. When the oaths are in my hands, I will hear your judgment. Show wisdom, judge, and compassion for all of us....~ /*You must learn from them the nature of the crime and from them obtain their written oath. When both oaths are in my hands, I shall hear your Judgment.*/
@59 = ~NP: I'm on full alert.~ /*Yes, I am ready.*/
@60 = ~NP: I need to think about it some more.~ /*No, I still need time to think about it.*/
@61 = ~NP: You are well aware of the charges the Lord of the Morning brings against you: on the evening of the winter solstice, long ago, the children of Charwood were brought here and murdered. Each of you defendants has already spoken in their own defense and delivered affidavits to the judge you see before you.~ /*You know well the charges that the Morninglord has brought against you: On a midwinter night, long ago, the children of Charwood were brought here and slaughtered.*/
@62 = ~NP: Hold your tongue, Carlat Jareg. You've already said your word and sworn an oath. That is all the court requires. Now it is time for the judge to decide the fate of us all... Judge, what is your decision?~ /*Hold your tongue, Karlat Jhareg. You have had your say and given your oath. That is all this court requires of you.*/
@63 = ~I find Quint guilty. Give the phylactery to Karlat.~
@64 = ~I find Karlat guilty. Destroy the phylactery.~
@65 = ~I find neither Quint nor Karlat guilty of the crime.~
@66 = ~There is no denying that a great crime has been committed, Judge. What evidence do you bring that it was not at the hands of the brothers Jhareg?~
@67 = ~I have the written oath of the demon Belial.~
@68 = ~I have no evidence, Spirit.~
@69 = ~Indeed... Belial, Lord of Fire, I summon you unto the court of Judgment.~
@70 = ~If you have no evidence, then you cannot make such a Judgment. I must ask you to Judge again.~
@71 = ~Karlat, you have been found innocent in the Judge's eyes. Here is the phylactery stolen from you by your brother. Take it and go.~
@72 = ~Quint, you have been found innocent in the Judge's eyes. Be free from your madness and die knowing that your brother's soul shall not be tainted by undeath.~
@73 = ~I too thank you for my freedom, Judge. Long have I stood watch over this castle. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?~
@74 = ~It was simple. Quint admitted his own guilt.~
@75 = ~I found Karlat's cause to be most just.~
@76 = ~I chose randomly between them.~
@77 = ~The Judge's heart is <PRO_HISHER> alone. Ask no more.~
@78 = ~Karlat's story didn't hold up to scrutiny.~
@79 = ~I found Quint's cause to be most just.~
@80 = ~That much is true. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@81 = ~Yes, give me the Morninglord's account.~
@82 = ~NP: No. It's getting late.~ /*Server is already full.*/
@83 = ~Perhaps it was. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@84 = ~So be it. Sometimes Fate is the wisest Judge of all. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@85 = ~Wise is the Judge who sees beyond the surface. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@86 = ~NP: The business is done. Latander declares this meeting adjourned for all present. When you leave, I will seal the castle doors, and you will never return.... May the blessing of the Lord of the Morning be upon the judge.~ /*When you leave, I shall seal the castle doors and you shall never return... May the Judge always know the blessings of the Morninglord.*/
@87 = ~NP: There is no doubt that a child murder took place within these walls on the night of the winter solstice. However, it is less clear what events led to this crime. Indeed, it was Quintus Jareg who gathered the village children for a feast in the castle library....~ /*That a slaughter of children happened within these walls one midwinter's night is beyond refute. Less clear, however, are the events that led to such a crime.*/
@88 = ~NP: But it was his brother, Carlat, who tricked him into doing it and started the slaughter with his spell.... Carlat wanted to become a noble baelorn, you see, and he was told that it required the blood of innocents....~ /*Karlat sought to become a noble baelnorn, you see, and had been told that the blood of innocents would be required...*/
@89 = ~It was the demon Belial who told him that lie, twisting Karlat's good intentions to an evil end...~
@90 = ~The phylactery was at the heart of it. Karlat needed it, Belial gave it, Quint stole it, Lathander confiscated it, I guarded it, and you Judged its fate.~
@91 = ~Long have I sensed that you, too, have been trapped within this castle. The Judge has produced your written confession and found you guilty.~
@92 = ~NP: It is Lathander's will that I guard this phylactery. The fate of the phylactery will determine the fate of all who gather here. Even mine. Even yours. Decide, judge. What will be the fate of the phylactery?~ /*I stand guard over the phylactery by Lathander's will. The fate of that phylactery determines the fate of all who gather here. Even me. Even you.*/
@93 = ~I shall take the phylactery myself.~
@94 = ~You shall guard it as you always have, Spirit.~
@95 = ~NP: By the power vested in me by the Lord of the Morning, I give this vessel to you, Judge. Take it and guard it for the rest of your days. According to your judgment, the souls of all those gathered here will be released. I have only one question: What made you pass such a sentence?~ /*With your Judgment, the souls of all gathered here are finally free of this place. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?*/
@96 = ~We all must be free, be it to do evil or good.~
@97 = ~I didn't realize this would be the consequence.~
@98 = ~NP: But - but the judge... No, I must not quarrel with the verdict. Only know that you have condemned all who are gathered here to eternal torment. Here we shall remain, forever banished from the waves of time, and we shall drag our endless lives in madness and despair. So you have judged, and so shall it be done.~ /*Here we shall stay, forever exiled from the weave of time to live out our endless lives in madness and decay. So have you Judged, so shall it be.*/
@99 = ~NP: I just have one question: What made the judge give that particular sentence?~ /*I have but one question left: What brought this Judge to <PRO_HISHER> Judgment?*/
@100 = ~In their own way, everyone is guilty.~
@101 = ~Well-spoken, then, and not without merit. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@102 = ~Then may woe follow you, Judge, wherever you may go... Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@103 = ~NP: Very good. In that case, for all those present, the judge will declare this meeting adjourned. When you leave, I will seal the castle doors and you will never return....~ /*Very well. To all assembled, then, the Judge declares this court adjourned.*/
@104 = ~NP: Charwood: Village of Eternal Night.

The strange village of Charwood is tucked away in the wilds of the forest that bears the same name. A wall of thick blue fog surrounds it, making it seem as if night always reigns in the village. At the entrance, wanderers are met by a madman named Quintus, who riddles them with riddles. In the village itself, it seems that the fog has clouded the minds of the villagers: they keep repeating the same things, shivering in the icy night air. The mayor is no different, but he is terrified by the very possibility that someone might enter the ominous castle of Jareg.~ /*The strange village of Charwood is buried deep within the forest that shares its name.
