@0 = ~You've shown yourself to be a completely immoral person. I'm so glad I'm leaving.~
@1 = ~Oh, my friend, is this true? I can't give you your money back. Are you you sure this is what you want?~
@2 = ~Yes. Go.~
@3 = ~No. Stay.~
@4 = ~Then I shall wait here until you have further need of me again. Please don't be long. Take care, <CHARNAME>. Where can we meet if you change your mind?~ 
@5 = ~Go back to the Trade of Blades.~ 
@6 = ~I'll find you at Kendrack's Barracks.~ 
@7 = ~Wait for me here.~ 
@8 = ~I hoped that you would return, so I waited here. I've hardly damaged anything since you left; I thought you'd be proud. May I join with you once more, my friend?~ [NWLIN060]
@9 = ~Yes.~
@10 = ~No.~
@11 = ~I shall try to breathe life back into you and your quest.~
@12 = ~(Sigh) Then I shall wait here for you to return.~
@13 = ~<CHARNAME>! I had hoped that you would show up here, my friend. I heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the evil cult that was responsible for the plague.~ [NWLIN053]
@14 = ~Linu, what a pleasant surprise.~
@15 = ~I thought we parted ways. Why have you followed me?~
@16 = ~Goodbye.~
@17 = ~I thought we had parted for good, <CHARNAME>, but the goddess has her own plans that I must follow. I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ 
@18 = ~You certainly know how to flatter yourself, <CHARNAME>, but I did not follow you here. I have my own goals and reasons for needing to be here. I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ 
@19 = ~If you find yourself spending a lot of time with the temple healers, you might want to come back here and hire me. Good luck.~
@20 = ~She told me that Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search. I was afraid I might have missed you while I was changing my clothes.~ 
@21 = ~Changing your clothes?~
@22 = ~I want you to join me again.~
@23 = ~Oh, when I came in the local tavern a waitress spilled some drinks.~
@24 = ~She soaked your clothes?~
@25 = ~Did you get mad at her?~
@26 = ~Oh, I'm so excited to be on another adventure with you. I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.~
@27 = ~Well... no. I bumped into her and when the drinks crashed down I leapt backwards into a dwarf, knocking over his ale and stew.~
@28 = ~So that messed you up?~
@29 = ~I think I'm getting the picture.~
@30 = ~Um, no, the food and drinks landed on the floor, but the dwarf crashed into a half-orc, causing the knife he was eating with to slice open his cheek. That's when the brawl started.~
@31 = ~And you wrecked your outfit in the brawl?~
@32 = ~Disaster follows you, doesn't it?~
@33 = ~I managed to stay out of the brawl, hiding under a table and feeling awfully guilty. When the fight was over I felt I should help clean up the mess.~
@34 = ~So you got dirty cleaning up?~
@35 = ~Please tell me that's how you got dirty.~
@36 = ~No, I wore an apron and managed to stay pretty clean. Then I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air and slipped in a mud puddle. So then I had to go change.~
@37 = ~Why didn't you just tell me you slipped in a puddle from the start?~
@38 = ~I think I'll go somewhere else now. Maybe to a nice safe dragon lair.~
@39 = ~I... I didn't want you to think I was clumsy. I'm waiting here at the orders of Lady Aribeth.~ 
@40 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@41 = ~I often am in need of a skilled healer. Join me.~
@42 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@43 = ~Oh, please don't leave now. I didn't want to frighten you away.~
@44 = ~Lord Nasher ordered all mercenaries to come to Port Llast to help discover the whereabouts of the cult that nearly destroyed his city.~
@45 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@46 = ~If you want to bring them to justice, why are you waiting in here?~
@47 = ~It would be a great pleasure, <CHARNAME>. I look forward to our adventures together. I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.~
@48 = ~I haven't heard anything specific about the cult, but I have heard about some trouble around Neverwinter Wood. I don't know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.~ 
@49 = ~I'm not much of an investigator. I have been ordered to travel with anyone who has need of a healer. You are the one who knows how to solve mysteries, <CHARNAME>. I would love to help you though. I have strong abilities in the art of healing, and I also can stand on my own in a fight. I would be a valuable resource for your quest.~ 
@50 = ~Having failed to destroy us with their terrible disease, it would hardly shock me to find out that the cult had struck with a plague of vicious animals. Is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~
@51 = ~Are you planning to travel there?~
@52 = ~Why are you waiting around in here? Should you be investigating the problem?~
@53 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. I do hope you remember me. I'm Linu La'neral, cleric of Sehanine Moonblade. I'm just waiting here so I can help someone bring those evil plague spreaders to justice.~ [NWLIN055]
