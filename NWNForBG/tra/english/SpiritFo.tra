@0 = ~The Spirit of the Wood looks at you in confusion.~
@1 = ~Can you speak?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Blurry images race through your mind. Very little is recognizable, except some images of small animals and other woodland creatures. Then the images become clearer.~
@4 = ~NP: A stream of pictures flashes through your mind: forest creatures of all shapes and sizes, trees and bushes, insects and rocks. These pictures blend into each other and include everything imaginable that can be found in the forest. The flickering of pictures slows down, and you see one creature. Although his features are blurred, it is clear that he is a dwarf. An image of the Spirit appears and the dwarf does something to the tree, but you don't quite understand what.~ /*A stream of pictures flicks through your mind: woodland creatures of all shapes and sizes, trees and bushes, insects and rocks. The images are jumbled together and include everything imaginable that could be found in a forest.*/
@5 = ~NP: Suddenly, the dwarf disappears and the image of the Spirit begins to fade. The forest creatures appear again, but now you see them as if through a red glass. Creatures begin to rush at each other, as well as at other figures in which something humanoid is guessed. You feel the fear and turmoil of the Spirit as the images merge into something indistinguishably dark. The spirit stands staring into the void, looking weaker than ever.~ /*The creatures begin to attack each other and other shapes that might be humanoid. You sense the fear and frustration of the Spirit as the images jumble together into incomprehensible darkness. The Spirit stands staring off into nothing, looking weaker than ever.*/
@6 = ~NP: Neverwinter Forest: Spirit of the Forest The spirit of Neverwinter Forest has been poisoned, and Aaville, the archdruid of the local druid conclave, is seriously concerned. He gave us access to the forest, hoping that we would help him figure out what was wrong. In the depths of the forest, a pond was discovered where the Spirit of the Forest performed a ritual to enter the spirit world. For a mortal, the only way to follow him is to enter the pond and die in its waters. In order to deprive a mortal of life, a magical dagger is required. The poisoned and tormented Spirit of the Forest retreated to his world. To those who came to his aid, he showed the image of the one who poisoned her - this is an unknown dwarf, who, apparently, is still hiding somewhere in the spirit world.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried. He has reluctantly granted forest access to adventurers so that they might help him right whatever has gone wrong.
Evidence discovered deeper in the forest tells of a pool at the base of a waterfall where the Spirit of the Woods would perform a ritual to enter the spirit world. The only way for mortals to follow is to enter that pool and die while in its waters. A magical dagger is obviously involved in the taking of one's life.

Poisoned and in great peril, the Spirit of the Woods has retreated to that world. To those who have come to help her, she has offered up images of her poisoner, a nameless dwarf who apparently hides within the spirit world, even now.*/
@7 = ~Fear and despair are the Spirit's only response to your return.~
@8 = ~What happened to you again?~
@9 = ~I have found the cure for you.~
@10 = ~NP: I don't know how to help you, I'll be back later.~ /*Me not knowing what me is doing to help. You say now?*/
@11 = ~You see a blurry image of yourself touching the Spirit, followed by the Spirit getting larger.~
@12 = ~Yes, I will cure you.~
@13 = ~NP: You must know where the treasure lies in the forest. Tell me about it to me, for starters.~ /*You must know where some treasure lies in the forest. Why don't you tell me where first?*/
@14 = ~No. I think it would be better to kill you.~
@15 = ~You walk forward and give the antidote to the Spirit. It shudders, then the Spirit seems to swell in size. Emotions of joy and love threaten to overwhelm your senses.~
@16 = ~The images in your mind gain clarity and focus as the Spirit recovers from the poison. An image of a fox curled around a sleeping rabbit fills your mind, along with an intensely protective feeling.~
@17 = ~Now can you show me what happened here?~
@18 = ~Feelings of confusion and despair radiate from the Spirit.~
@19 = ~All right, I guess I'll cure you.~
@20 = ~No gold, no cure. I guess you can just suffer and die.~
@21 = ~A wash of emotional despair covers your thoughts, then anger and hatred. The Spirit attacks.~

The poisoned and tormented Spirit of the Forest retreated to his world, but we found and killed the sufferer. It is necessary to inform the archdruid Aavill about the fate of the Spirit.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried.

@23 = ~You see a group of men come into the forest. A familiar, evil-eyed dwarf is with the group. They go to the pool and the dwarf steps into it. One of the men walks over and thrusts a dagger through the back of the dwarf's throat.~
@24 = ~Go on.~
@25 = ~Relmar, the crazy dwarf!~
@26 = ~The image dissolves and suddenly you can see that the dwarf is in the Spirit's realm. A few minutes later he is joined by several of the other men. One of the other men mouths a word, and the name "Relmar" forms in your mind.~
@27 = ~The image dissolves and suddenly you can see that the dwarf is in the Spirit's realm. A few minutes later Relmar is joined by several of the other men.~
@28 = ~The group walks toward the Spirit's tree, spreading out until they form a circle. Three of the men rush at the Spirit, while Relmar sneaks up on the tree. Relmar takes his axe and coats the edge with a green liquid. He hacks at the tree a couple of times.~
@29 = ~So that's how they managed to poison you. But why did they want to?~
@30 = ~That's not the part I care about. What were they after?~
@31 = ~NP: The next picture shows how two men, from those who did not participate in the fight, run towards a tree. They begin to dig at its roots until they come up with a smooth, flat rock. One of the men in the picture laughs and then recites a spell. Both step into the formed portal and disappear. Relmar tries to run into the portal, but it's already gone.~ /*The image returns with the two men who were not in the fight running over to the tree. They start to dig between its roots until they uncover a smooth, flat stone.*/
@32 = ~The last of the men fighting the weakened Spirit are slain and Relmar flees away from the tree to disappear.~
@33 = ~What was on that stone?~
@34 = ~NP: All images disappear from your head, a sparkling symbol takes their place. This sign pulsates with energy, and you feel incredibly powerful magic. As you look at the rune, a sense of power is replaced by a sense of time. Ages pass you by, from the present to the past: long before your time... to the humanoid races... even before humanity gained power.~ /*As you look at the rune, the feeling changes from power to time. You feel ages slipping away, from your present to the past: long before your time... before the demihuman races... even before the humans had power.*/
@35 = ~NP: The sense of time disappears, and only the image of the Spirit remains, which places a stone between the roots of a tree. Then all the pictures go out of your head, and your body feels a certain deformation for a few seconds. Spirit smiles at you. The last thing you feel is the atmosphere of a warm goodbye.~ /*The sense of time disappears and you are left with an image of the Spirit placing the stone in the roots of the tree. The images recede entirely from your mind and your body feels distorted for a short moment.*/

For a mortal, the only way to follow him is to enter the pond and die in its waters. The poisoned and tormented Spirit of the Forest retreated to his world, but the medicine that could save the Spirit of the Forest was found and delivered to him. Having fully restored the lost strength, the Spirit will be able to restore the forest to its former balance. Aaville will be happy to hear this good news.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried.

Poisoned and in great peril, the Spirit of the Woods has retreated to that world, but a cure for the troubled Spirit was finally recovered.

Renewed to her former vigor, the Spirit will once again be able to restore the forest to its proper balance. Aawill will be eager to hear the good news.*/
@37 = ~A sense of rage and helplessness emanates from the Spirit of the Wood.~
@38 = ~A feeling of peace emanates from the Spirt of the Wood. All is well.~
@39 = ~NP: Neverwinter Forest: Spirit of the Forest The Spirit of the Neverwinter Forest has been in a sorry state of late, and Archdruid Aavill, who leads the conclave, is very concerned about this.

With great reluctance, he allowed us to enter the forest, in the hope that we would help him find out what had happened.

However, they have no idea what the ritual might be.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Wood has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried.
