@0 = ~Is there something I can do for you, <SIRMAAM>?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Make it quick - my time is better spent easing the suffering of my patients.~
@4 = ~What can you tell me about the plague?~
@5 = ~Have you heard any rumors lately?~
@6 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@7 = ~May whatever Gods you pray to keep you safe from the plague.~
@8 = ~As much as most, less than some, I suppose. I've seen my share of the dead and dying since I started to work here tending the sick.~
@9 = ~Have you heard anything about a cure for the Wailing Death?~
@10 = ~Did you hear anything about the attack on the Academy?~
@11 = ~How did you end up tending the afflicted here?~
@12 = ~NP: I'd like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@13 = ~I've heard my share. Desther and Aribeth are always arguing and Fenthick's always trying to keep the peace. None of them pay any attention to a quiet little nurse going about her duties, so I've heard all sorts of stuff about each and every one of them.~ /*None of them pay any attention to a quiet little nurse going about her duties, so I've heard all sorts of stuff about each and every one of them.*/
@14 = ~Tell me what you've heard about Desther.~
@15 = ~Tell me what you've heard about Aribeth.~
@16 = ~Tell me what you've heard about Fenthick.~
@17 = ~I'm here to tend the sick and the dying, not play tour guide. Besides, all you have to do is go outside the front door of the Hall of Justice. The City Core district has every kind of shop, store or inn you'll ever need, I suspect.~ /*Besides, all you have to do is go outside the front door of the Hall of Justice. The City Core district has every kind of shop, store or inn you'll ever need, I suspect.*/
@18 = ~There's no cure for the plague, everybody knows that! All I can do is try to ease their suffering and make their last days less painful.~
@19 = ~That's it? You haven't heard the rumors about a cure from Waterdeep?~
@20 = ~I heard Fenthick and Desther whispering about it once, but they clammed up as soon as they saw me. That Desther gave me a foul look.~
@21 = ~What were they saying?~
@22 = ~You don't like Desther much, do you?~
@23 = ~I was a midwife, before the plague. But there ain't many babies being born now - not live ones, anyhow. I heard Castle Never needed nurses to tend their sick and dying, so I came.~
@24 = ~Aren't you afraid of contracting the plague yourself?~
@25 = ~NP: I have to tend to the sick, but I can spare a few minutes for you.~ /*I really should be tending the sick, but for you my <LADYLORD> I can spare a few moments.*/
@26 = ~Aribeth doesn't like him, I know that much. He's got a sharp tongue and a sour face, but I think it's more than that. But it's not really my place to speak of such things.~
@27 = ~NP: Tell me. There's no harm done.~ /*Come now, telling me won't do any harm.*/
@28 = ~Lady Aribeth's always telling Fenthick not to put so much faith in Desther and his Helmites. You know they're lovers? Fenthick and Aribeth, I mean. Of course you know. Everybody knows.~
@29 = ~Poor Fenthick. He's caught in the middle between Desther and Aribeth, always ends up having to pick one side or the other when they argue about how to save the city. You think he'd always side with Aribeth, since they are lovers. But Fenthick's an honest man, and when Aribeth is wrong, he's not afraid to tell her so.~ /*Poor Fenthick. He's caught in the middle between Desther and Aribeth, always ends up having to pick one side or the other when they argue about how to save the city.*/
@30 = ~A cure from Waterdeep? How are they going to get it here with Neverwinter under quarantine! Throw it up over the walls? You're talking crazy.~
@31 = ~Desther was saying the attack was all Aribeth's fault, and Fenthick was trying to defend her. That's all I heard.~
@32 = ~He's sour, that one. A bitter man with a sharp tongue. But he's a man of the cloth, and his Helmites do good work around the city, helping the sick. Desther's not a real friendly sort, but I guess that ain't no crime. I just try to stay out of his way.~ /*He's sour, that one. A bitter man with a sharp tongue. But he's a man of the cloth, and his Helmites do good work around the city, helping the sick.*/
@33 = ~Some people won't have nothing to do with the sick. They board themselves up in their homes and don't come out for no reason. And they still get the Wailing Death. The Helmites don't catch it from helping the sick, so why should I? The plague takes who it wants, when it wants. Nothing anyone can do about that.~ /*Some people won't have nothing to do with the sick. They board themselves up in their homes and don't come out for no reason. And they still get the Wailing Death.*/
@34 = ~Desther and his Helmites showed up soon after the plague started, just in time to get locked inside the city when the quarantine hit. Desther says they came because they heard about Neverwinter's suffering, but it seems like odd timing to Lady Aribeth. Or so she told Fenthick once.~ /*Desther says they came because they heard about Neverwinter's suffering, but it seems like odd timing to Lady Aribeth. Or so she told Fenthick once.*/
@35 = ~Is there something else you wanted to know? Or can I get back to my duties?~
@36 = ~What do you want? And be quick about it - can't you see how busy I am here?~
