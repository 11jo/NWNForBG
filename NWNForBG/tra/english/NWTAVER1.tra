@0 = ~I wish the damn thing would start. Have they got the goods or not?~
@1 = ~I sold everything. All of it. This better be a cure. I'm ruined if it isn't. I'm dead if it isn't.~
@2 = ~Vengaul better not be telling his damned stories again. You don't jerk around a city full of the dying.~
@3 = ~I bet there ain't no cure. I mean, how did Vengaul get a cure when Nasher and them can't?~
@4 = ~I heard it's just part of a cure. Gotta have the means to process it. Some thug buys it and it'll go to waste.~
@5 = ~Last I saw Vengaul he was carrying some kinda cage. Why's he walking his pets when there's business to be done?~
@6 = ~I heard Vengaul's on the way out. Too flashy. Wants everything to be a grand adventure. Glory hound.~
@7 = ~Callik ain't here, is he? He doesn't like this one bit, I hear. Must be getting tired of being in Vengaul's shadow.~
@8 = ~You know... there's not a single Vengaul loyalist in the room... I wonder if he's even here.~
@9 = ~The auction has been delayed twice... What the hell. If there's a cure, I want it NOW!~
@10 = ~Auction turned out to be a bust. Guess us simple thugs are stuck to die of the plague.~
@11 = ~Callik is gone. Looks like Vengaul is sticking around as leader after all. Never had my doubts... no sir...~
