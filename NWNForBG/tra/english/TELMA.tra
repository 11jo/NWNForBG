@0 = ~NP: Hello. Why did they come? No, I don't really mind... I don't know why you shouldn't come in. You can walk wherever you please. Is it true. I didn't want to panic. My name is Thelma... If you're interested.~ /*And there's no reason you shouldn't go where you want. Really. I didn't mean to cause a fuss. My name is Telma... if you want to know.*/
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose... Is there a reason you are here? Again, I don't really mean to object, but if there's nothing here for you...~
@4 = ~Do you know of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Oh. All right then. Uh... please close the door behind you... ?~
@7 = ~No! I mean, of course not. Why would I know of anything odd? I mean, there's the plague, of course. What else needs to be happening besides that?~
@8 = ~You seem agitated. Is there something hidden here?~
@9 = ~You seem agitated. Are you all right?~
@10 = ~It kills people no matter where they go or what they do. Maybe the nobles can do something, but I'm just a servant.~
@11 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@12 = ~NP: I... Well, I didn't want you to think that... Oh, to hell with it. It looks like you already know. There is something under my house. You see, we dug up... er... a cellar, well, a place behind a bookcase... To hide things from the city guards. But we didn't get anything.~ /*See, we were digging a... uh... storage place behind the bookcase and down... well, to hide things from the city guards. It didn't pan out, though.*/
@13 = ~Oh, I'm fine, of course. Nothing wrong with me. Nothing is out of sorts here. Nothing at all.~
@14 = ~If there is something odd here, you should tell me.~
@15 = ~Come now, fair lass, are you keeping secrets from me?~
@16 = ~Something's wrong here. What is it?! Tell me or die!~
@17 = ~NP: Well, I waited on Lord Fontlebottom at the weekly meeting at the Gelder Club, he belongs to old Jim Gelder, and he said something like that. He said, &quot;The healing creatures went missing after the attack.&quot; To me, that's complete nonsense. He's been out of his mind since... Well... He's always out of his mind.~ /*He said "cure creatures were lost to an attack." Sounds like gibberish to me. He hasn't been the same since... well... he's never been "all there."*/
@18 = ~There's... something not right down there. There's a door we could never open and... *sounds* that come from behind it. Look at the bookcase and say the word "Halueth." You'll see for yourself.~
@19 = ~What kind of sounds?~
@20 = ~I'm going to go look, all right?~
@21 = ~I'm going to go look. Stay out of my way.~
@22 = ~NP: Maybe you can do something about it? I don't have to worry anymore? I think I can talk to you. We found an entry in an old book, and when we said the word, the closet opened. We wanted to dig a hiding place there so the guards wouldn't find it, but there was... There was a tunnel.~ /*See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.*/
@23 = ~Oh no, I'm staying right out of it. I don't know what's going on, and I don't want to.~
@24 = ~NP: You are impudent - you came to my house, and now make eyes at me. Stop it. I'll tell you if you leave later. We found an entry in an old book, and when we said the word, the closet opened. We wanted to dig a hiding place there so the guards wouldn't find it, but there was... There was a tunnel.~ /*See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.*/
@25 = ~I don't know, and I won't try to find out! Maybe you want to, but I'm not going to go looking for ways to be stupid.~
@26 = ~That's your decision, I guess. The entrance is hidden behind the bookcase. Please, just try not to stir anything up. I have to live here.~
@27 = ~All right, all right, the entrance is hidden behind the bookcase. Please, please don't stir up trouble. I have to live here.~
@28 = ~NP: You again? What you need?~ /*Yes? What do you need?*/
@29 = ~Please... I've already told all I can... I just want people to leave my home. Just leave me... It's no secret anymore.~
@30 = ~Go over this secret again for me.~
@31 = ~Tell me about what is going on here! Say or die!~
@32 = ~NP: We found an entry in an old book, and when we said the word, the closet opened. We wanted to dig a hiding place there so the guards wouldn't find it, but there was... There was a tunnel. There's something bad down there. There's a door that won't open and... *sounds* come from behind it. Look at the closet and say the word &quot;Heluet&quot;. You will see for yourself.~ /*See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.*/
@33 = ~NP: Why offend me? Of course, I will say... But why threaten?! It's just a word... Just a weird little word. You speak and the closet opens. The word will be &quot;Heluet&quot;. I don't even know what it means. It's just... We used to hide things in the aisle. But we didn't get far. It's scary... And it smells... bad. This is an old place... We were digging a cellar, and we found it... It would be better if we didn't find it! There is something... Behind the door.~ /*I don't even know what it means. It's just... we used to hide things in the passage. We don't go too far, though. It's eerie... and smells... wrong. We used to hide things from the guards down there, but not anymore.*/
@34 = ~Are you telling me everything?!~
@35 = ~I don't know, I don't know! Please! Just get out! Just get out!~
@36 = ~Don't know why you're in my home now. Whatever was in my basement is done and gone. Maybe things will get back to normal now.~
