@0 = ~Greetings, stranger. You've been rather the trouble-maker, haven't you? You've cut through my men rather efficiently. I can respect that.~ [NWKURT55]
@1 = ~In fact, I could use someone as strong as you to get rid of Baram for me. Not an easy task, I grant, but I'd reward you well. What would you say to that?~
@2 = ~What would the reward be, exactly?~
@3 = ~Baram is already dead, actually.~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions, first.~
@5 = ~I would never work for you!~
@6 = ~Well, let's see. I have a few magic items here that might interest you... they are worth a great deal. Plus 1000 gold pieces on top of that? All you'd have to do is bring me Baram's head. Would that interest you?~ 
@7 = ~I want to get into the Host Tower.~
@8 = ~What about Elynwyd's sister, Evaine? Do you have her?~
@9 = ~Baram already made me the same offer.~
@10 = ~Perhaps. I want more gold, however.~
@11 = ~Aye, I'm interested.~
@12 = ~So you've already spoken to Baram... and the little rat had the same idea I had, did he? Well, well. What do you plan to do, then, stranger?~
@13 = ~I was hoping you could make me a better offer.~
@14 = ~Nothing at all.~
@15 = ~Well, then... either that shows your good sense or Baram's wasted his coin. Either way, you've come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I'll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?~ 
@16 = ~Oh? You don't say? I find that hard to believe... High Captain Suljack was supposed to be dead, as well, but I've had it on good authority he's quite alive. You wouldn't happen to have his head, would you? I'd consider that definitive proof.~ 
@17 = ~Yes, I have his head here.~
@18 = ~Uh. I don't have the head.~
@19 = ~I'd be more than willing to answer your questions... *if* you agree to kill Baram.~
@20 = ~Ahhh, that's a shame really. Do let me know if you change your mind. And should you get any ideas about continuing your path past this portcullis... I'd forget them, were I you.~ 
@21 = ~Now why would you want to get into there? I suppose it's no concern of mine... if you wish to kill yourself, it's your business. Regardless, I'm not about to cross the tower by giving you my own papers. Baram has his own, however... accept my offer and you can take his, if you wish.~ 
@22 = ~The elf girl? Why... yes, I do. Quite a pretty lass, that one. Why would she interest you?~
@23 = ~I want her released.~
@24 = ~I just wanted to know that, that's all.~
@25 = ~Greedy, are we? Ha ha... I could learn to like you. Very well: 1500 gold pieces, no more. What do you think now?~
@26 = ~I want to get into the Host Tower, as well.~
@27 = ~No, thanks.~
@28 = ~Good to hear! Let's hope you can settle the matter for me... and then all of us will be that much happier. Now, then... I imagine you have some questions for me, yes? Or are you ready to go and give that little rat what he deserves?~ 
@29 = ~I have some questions.~
@30 = ~I've changed my mind.~
@31 = ~I'll go now.~
@32 = ~Hmmm... I just might, at that. What is the little rat paying you?~
@33 = ~1000 gold pieces.~
@34 = ~1500 gold pieces.~
@35 = ~2000 gold pieces.~
@36 = ~You forgets it. Me not interested.~
@37 = ~Hah! I wouldn't trust that you'd keep your end of the bargain for a second! Either way, you've come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I'll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?~ 
@38 = ~Really? Do show me. Ahhhh, yes... that is, indeed, Baram's head. I'd heard the rat had been recently killed, I simply wasn't sure you were the one who'd done it. So be it, stranger... you've earned your reward. Here is the gold you were promised, and the items. Take them and go.~ 
@39 = ~What about Evaine?~
@40 = ~I want Evaine released, as well.~
@41 = ~That's it? We're done?~
@42 = ~Good. Now we can kill you.~
@43 = ~Ah. Well, until I see the rat's little head up close, I'll not believe he's dead for a second.~
@44 = ~Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. Bring me Baram's head and you can have her.~
@45 = ~What about my original offer, then? Baram's head in exchange for the reward... ?~
@46 = ~Now, now, stranger... 1000 gold is a lot of coin, and that's *if* you can do the job. Are you interested or not?~
@47 = ~Ahhh, that's a shame really. Do let me know if you change your mind. And should you get any ideas about continuing your path past this portcullis... I'd forget them, were I you.~ 
@48 = ~Ask away.~
@49 = ~What do you hope to get out of all this?~
@50 = ~Do you know what's going on in the Host Tower?~
@51 = ~Where can I find Baram?~
@52 = ~What do you know about Baram's defenses?~
@53 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@54 = ~I just wanted to know, that's all.~
@55 = ~You have, have you? I think you've been trying to play me all along. Well, then, stranger... good for you. Well done. However you think your schemes will turn out, attempt to take one foot into my base and you will quickly discover otherwise.~ 
@56 = ~Very well. I hope to see Baram's head soon. Just so you're aware, I'd rather keep word of our deal a secret, so Baram doesn't get wind of it. My men on the street won't know you're working for me, so no doubt they'll still attack you... not that they've hindered you so far. Oh... one more thing, stranger. No matter what deal we have, should you try to enter my base I'll assume your intentions are hostile. But of course we needn't worry, yes?~ 

@58 = ~Is that so? I can offer you more, then... 1500 gold pieces. Plus a magic item or two, to make it interesting. All for Baram's head... what do you say?~
@59 = ~Is that so? I can offer you more, then... 1500 gold pieces. Plus a magic item or two, to make it interesting. All for Baram's head... what do you say?~
@60 = ~I'm sure he's not paying you so much. I will, however... 1500 gold, plus a few magic items, all for Baram's head. What do you say?~
@61 = ~Hah! I wouldn't trust that you'd keep your end of the bargain for a second! Either way, you've come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I'll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?~ 
@62 = ~What about her? Oh... you didn't actually think I was going to release her, did you? Foolish <MANWOMAN>! The girl's been a source of endless pleasure and amusement. Since I'm the last High Captain, I can do what I like... and I'll be holding onto her, thank you. As for you and I, our business is done. Off you go... before you get hurt.~ 
@63 = ~Fine. But this isn't over.~
@64 = ~I killed one High Captain... I can just as easily kill another.~
@65 = ~That's horrible! You'll never get away with this!~
@66 = ~Now, now... that wasn't part of our agreement, was it? And even if it was, I doubt I'd be releasing her now, anyway. The girl's been a source of endless pleasure and amusement. Since I'm the last High Captain, I can do what I like... and I'll be holding onto her, thank you. As for you and I, our business is done. Off you go... before you get hurt.~ 
@67 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@68 = ~Oh? Don't be a fool, stranger. I am the last High Captain and I have much to plan for... be smart and run along, now.~
@69 = ~Perhaps you thought I was joking when I said I wished Baram's head. I'm not... run back to wherever you left him or you'll receive no reward.~
@70 = ~So if Baram is actually dead, I'm sure you won't mind running back to wherever it is you left him and fetching his head for me, now, would you? It should not be a difficult matter... unless he's *not* dead at all. Either way, I can offer you quite a reward for doing so.~ 
@71 = ~What kind of reward?~
@72 = ~No Thanks~
@73 = ~I'm interested.~
@74 = ~What about my original offer, then? Baram's head in exchange for the reward... ?~
@75 = ~What of elf girl, Evaine?~
@76 = ~Ask away.~
@77 = ~You have, have you? I think you've been trying to play me all along. Well, then, stranger... good for you. Well done. However you think your schemes will turn out, attempt to take one foot into my base and you will quickly discover otherwise.~ 
@78 = ~Very well. I hope to see Baram's head soon. Just so you're aware, I'd rather keep word of our deal a secret, so Baram doesn't get wind of it. My men on the street won't know you're working for me, so no doubt they'll still attack you... not that they've hindered you so far. Oh... one more thing, stranger. No matter what deal we have, should you try to enter my base I'll assume your intentions are hostile. But of course we needn't worry, yes?~ 
@79 = ~Ha ha! That's a rather forward question, isn't it? Most people simply assume I want to rule the city... or have gone insane. It's far more than that, naturally. The High Captain who survives to the last will become Luskan's war leader... and that shall be me.~ 
@80 = ~Why would Luskan need a war leader?~
@81 = ~Only a little. There has been a bloody power struggle within the tower as of late, and a new Archmage Arcane has arisen. I've met the mage once, only. His name is Maugrim... quite an interesting fellow. Seems to hate Neverwinter something fierce, it seems.~ 
@82 = ~In the sewers, of course, where we drove him to. He's got himself walled up in a little fortress down there, surrounded by necromancers.~
@83 = ~Little. You should know, however, that Baram has infected himself with lycanthropy. I don't call him a rat for nothing. He's spread the disease to most of his men, as well... and no doubt has had his necromancers whipping up undead like mad. How he arrays them all in his fortress, I'm not so sure of... but you should be aware of what you'll be facing.~ 
@84 = ~Aye? What do you wish, then?~
@85 = ~I want Elynwyd's sister released, as well.~
@86 = ~Why would ye even care? I certainly don't.~
@87 = ~Oh, but it is. Come into my base and you'll be killed, to put it simply. Now... if you'll excuse me, I have things to attend to.~
@88 = ~Take one step in here and you'll be gutted like a rat. I am no Baram, after all. Now... if you'll excuse me, I have plans to make.~
@89 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@90 = ~Only a little. There has been a bloody power struggle within the tower as of late, and a new Archmage Arcane has arisen. I've met the mage once, only. His name is Maugrim... quite an interesting fellow. Seems to hate Neverwinter something fierce, it seems.~ 
@91 = ~Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. But only once you've brought me Baram's head. No sooner.~
@92 = ~Then why even bring her up? She certainly isn't the first woman I've taken for my... personal use.~
@93 = ~Now that would be telling. I'm sure you'll know soon enough.~
@94 = ~Back again, are you, stranger? Have you changed your mind and given my offer some thought, perhaps?~ [NWKURT54]
@95 = ~Hah! I've no interest in working for you.~
@96 = ~What is it now? I trust you bring me word of Baram's death, correct?~ [NWKURT52]
@97 = ~I do. Baram is dead.~
@98 = ~Very well. I hope to see Baram's head soon.~
@99 = ~Baram dead.~
@100 = ~We have no further business, you and I! Take one step into my base and you'll pay the consequences, fool!~ [NWKURT51]
