@0 = ~Oh, hello my lady. Your smile stunned me for a second.~ [TARAN056]
@1 = ~You don't seem stunned at all. What is your name?~
@2 = ~You expect me to buy that line? What's your name?~
@3 = ~Thanks for the compliment. Could you answer some questions?~
@4 = ~That nice. Me have questions.~
@5 = ~MT: I'm sorry. I will go.~ /*Okay. Me go now.*/
@6 = ~My name is Tarran and it is a distinct pleasure to meet you, my lady. What may I call you?~
@7 = ~MT: My name is<CHARNAME> . It's very nice to meet you, Tarran.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you, Revat.*/
@8 = ~You no ask name. You not need know.~
@9 = ~MT: Sorry, I have to leave.~ /*Excuse me, I must be going.*/
@10 = ~I could think of nothing more pleasant than to gaze into your eyes and converse for hours, if only it was not such a terrible day.~
@11 = ~I am sorry your day is so dark. Might I ask for your name?~
@12 = ~I am hunting the cult that started the plague in Neverwinter. Have you heard anything about them?~
@13 = ~I wish I could help you, but I am in need of a job. Do you know of anything?~
@14 = ~You seem like a very lonely person. My name is Jaheel. What is your name?~
@15 = ~I'm called <CHARNAME>.~
@16 = ~My name isn't important right now.~
@17 = ~I'm going now.~
@18 = ~I guess I could, although my mind is occupied with worry about this terrible day.~
@19 = ~Thank you <CHARNAME>. I only wish I could give you all of my attention. My mind is focused on darker thoughts. What can I do for you?~
@20 = ~MT: What happened to you?~ /*What happened here?*/
@21 = ~A <PRO_LADYLORD> of mystery. While I love an intrigue, today is just too bleak a moment in my life to give you proper attention. Can I help you?~
@22 = ~You know stuff 'bout cult that start bad plague in Neverwinter, maybe?~
@23 = ~MT: I would really like to help you, but my mind is too tired and it is very difficult for me to concentrate on anything other than my own problems.~ /*I wish I could help you, kind <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but my mind is overwrought and it is very difficult for me to focus on anything other than my own troubles.*/
@24 = ~MT: Your problems are not interesting to me, I need to leave.~ /*You beg, but me still kill you!*/
@25 = ~I take it that you are an adventurer? Perhaps I could employ you to assist me with a serious problem?~
@26 = ~MT: I'm very embarrassed. I had to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a present for his tenth birthday. He was so happy that he ran ahead of me all the time. He ran up the hill, and then suddenly screamed. I ran as fast as I could to the top of the hill, but when I ran closer, I heard male voices. I fell to the ground and peered over the top of the hill.~ /*I am ashamed. I was supposed to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a birthday present for his tenth birthday. He was so excited he kept running ahead of me.*/
@27 = ~MT: The Neva was surrounded by a gang of robbers. They grabbed him and dragged him somewhere, laughing. I could have tried to save him myself, but last year I hurt my hand and now I can't hold a sword. The guards are busy with their own problems, and I need someone to rescue him quickly.~ /*I would try to rescue him myself, but I wounded my hand last year and am unable to hold a sword properly. The guards are busy with their own troubles and I need someone who can rescue him quickly.*/
@28 = ~Why do you think the bandits took him captive?~
@29 = ~Do you know where the bandits took him?~
@30 = ~Are you offering a reward for his rescue?~
@31 = ~I would love to rescue him for you.~
@32 = ~MT: I don't want a gang of robbers to slit my throat. Farewell.~ /*That's rough, but I'm not really interested in getting my throat slit by a gang of thugs. Goodbye.*/
@33 = ~I imagine it is because he had his birthday money in his purse. He had 10 gold pieces to spend for his birthday. That is a lot, so the bandits probably figured he was from a wealthy home and they want to ransom him.~
@34 = ~Yes. I quietly followed them to a camp near some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood. I would have gone in myself, except for this wounded hand.~
@35 = ~I have 300 gold, which I would reward anyone who could save my baby brother.~
@36 = ~Your beauty is outshone only by your bravery. I must admit, that if you are able to rescue my baby brother, there are rewards besides gold that I would be willing to discuss.~
@37 = ~MT: I know that the Neva is being kept in a bandit camp near the vertical stones next to Charwood, but I don't know exactly how many people are guarding it and what can be expected of them. Please hurry! Bring him to me safe!~ /*I know Neva is being held at a bandit camp near some standing stones just outside of Charwood, but I have no idea how many people are holding him or what exactly to expect.*/
@38 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@39 = ~A young man by the name of Neva has apparently been kidnapped by bandits. According to his siblings, Tarran and Jaheel, he is being held near some standing stones by the entrance to the Charwood. Adventurers are to meet the siblings there to attempt a rescue.~
@40 = ~MT: Consider that the Neva has already been saved. Don't worry.~ /*Neva is as good as rescued. Do not worry, my lady.*/
@41 = ~You are back so soon? Have you found my little brother?~ [TARAN058]
@42 = ~I can't remember where you said that stone formation was.~
@43 = ~Not yet, but I'm working on it.~
@44 = ~Don't rush me. I'll save him eventually.~
@45 = ~It is in the hills just outside of Charwood. If you search carefully you should find it.~
@46 = ~Please find him quickly. I enjoy speaking with you, but I could be much friendlier if I wasn't so worried about Neva.~
@47 = ~Neva might be dead soon! Please hurry, if only so that you can claim your reward.~
@48 = ~MT: You're back? I really need your help.~ /*All hands to me! I need your aid!*/
