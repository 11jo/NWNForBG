@5 = ~Guess what - this isn't a rescue. I'm just here to kill you!~
@6 = ~I am an Uthgardt of the Golden Eagle tribe. The giants captured me during a raid on our camp. We fought to defend the land of our ancestors, but the giants were too many and several of us were taken prisoner.~

@13 = ~And just who are you, exactly? And why did the Hill Giants capture you?~
@14 = ~Among my people we have heard whispers of this evil name. It is said this Klauth lives in a fortress in the Spine of the World. They say even Skrogg, the great fire giant king in the North, has sworn fealty to Klauth. What manner of person this Klauth may be is not known to my people but it was Klauth who sent the fire giant envoy with his offer of gold in exchange for dragon's eggs.~ /*Among my people we have heard whispers of this evil name. It is said this Klauth lives in a fortress in the Spine of the World. They say even Skrogg, the great fire giant king in the North, has sworn fealty to Klauth.*/
