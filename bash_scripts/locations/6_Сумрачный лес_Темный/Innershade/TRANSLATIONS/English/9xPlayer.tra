@2    = ~I am here, you don't have to look for me among your dreams anymore, <CHARNAME>. Why do you wish to speak with me?~ [ISHxDRE]
@3    = ~Do you still see existence as a torment, Dream?~
@4    = ~I'd like to know more about your creator. Who was she?~
@5    = ~Your assimilation weakened me. How does this thing work? Is it always like that?~
@6    = ~Are there any other creatures like you? I have never seen beings like you before.~
@7    = ~Do you know where your creator is now?~
@8    = ~How long can you live?~
@9    = ~I'm curious... are you able to see my dreams? Do you see what happens in them? I've seen Imoen and Irenicus. Do you know something about that?~
@10   = ~What do you do when I'm not talking with you?~
@11   = ~I'd like to know you better. Tell me something about your past, what you have experienced, please.~
@12   = ~You already told me something about your past, but I feel that you didn't tell me everything. Would you like to continue?~
@13   = ~I'd like to talk about your past again. Is there something you'd like to add? Was it the end of your story?~
@14   = ~I was wondering... do you regret telling me your story?~
@15   = ~You told me much about yourself. I'm glad you trust me. If there's anything else you'd like to tell me, I'd be happy to hear it.~
@16   = ~I don't have any questions for now.~
@17   = ~Do you want to know something more?~
@18   = ~Do you still see your life as a torment?~
@19   = ~I'd like to know something about the one who created you.~

@25   = ~What do you do when I'm not talking with you, Dream?~
@26   = ~I'd like to know some more about you and your existence. Tell me something about your past, what you have experienced, please.~
@27   = ~You told me something about your past, but I think it wasn't finished at the time. Would you like to continue? I'd like to listen to it.~
@28   = ~I'd like to talk about your past again, if you don't mind. Is there something you'd like to add? Was that the end of your story?~
@29   = ~I want to ask you something: do you regret telling me your story?~
@30   = ~You told me much about yourself, Dream. I'm glad that you trust me. If there's anything you'd like to tell me, I'd be happy to hear it. Remember that.~
@31   = ~No. Thank you.~
@32   = ~Life is something I was never granted. This is existence, something much different, but still, I know what you wanted to ask, <CHARNAME>.~
@33   = ~It is not tormenting anymore. It is more like a cage, now. I am still away from my creator, but I am able to see through your eyes. Maybe this will make me understand my creator's motives. When I see new places, new faces, it is a lesson for me, something that makes me feel better. But isn't it useless, since I can't show those images to anyone? You have your dreams. I exist among them as a separate entity, but it is not I who creates those images.~
@34   = ~So, is this torment? No, but it is still not the existence I had almost a century ago.~
@35   = ~I am not sure what I should tell you. Now I am not sure if I know her. She is much different from the girl she used to be. I am sure she still lives somewhere. She is a witch. What more can I tell you? She is full of grief that consumes her from inside. I pity her, but still I would like to see her again. I hope you understand.~
@36   = ~Do you hate her?~
@37   = ~But do you know her name? What is she called?~
@38   = ~I'd like to ask you a different question.~
@39   = ~Hate? I do not think this is the right word. I do not *understand* her. There is nothing else I can tell you about her. Also, this is not the subject I would like to concentrate on. Not now... It has been so long since that day... It would be better to forget, but I will never give in to that possibility.~
@40   = ~I will not reveal that name to anyone. Not until she remembers it again. She must do it herself. I am not sure if that's possible without me. It probably is. I *wish* I could help her, I *wish* I was needed to accomplish that. But it does not matter. Please forget about this subject. Do not ask about her name, since I won't answer.~
@41   = ~I was never part of your soul, heart, mind or dream. I was like a thorn that wounded you inside. It is always like that. It was your decision, still I should be grateful you made it. I am sorry that I do not show my gratitude to you. It is a bit complicated. Let us get back to your question: both your body and soul became a kind of hideout for me. Though after some time, you became accustomed to this new situation, so you felt better. That is how it works, but I am sure you will never experience this in your whole life, <CHARNAME>.~
@42   = ~You do not have to understand it. It is meaningless now. Still, I know it is your curiosity that asked the question.~
@43   = ~And you will probably never see another again. I never heard of anyone of my kind. I am a Dream who lives without my creator. I am the only one, I will never meet any of my kind. The one who created me did it: she succeeded in leaving behind her dreams, wishes and painful memories. It is me she get rid of. Why would someone else do something like that? Who would like to commit that kind of sin against the their own existence?~
@44   = ~Someone could probably still do that. If he or she had the same motives your creator had...~
@45   = ~You're probably right.~
@46   = ~I'm sure many people would like that, to be honest.~
@47   = ~I want to ask you another question.~
@48   = ~Then I pity that poor creature for not understanding his or her own wish. It is breaking the rule of existence. I just cannot understand it.~
@49   = ~(The voice stays silent for a few moments. Then you hear it again.)~
@50   = ~(The voice stays silent for a few moments. It seems that this subject is quite difficult to comprehend for the Dream inside you. You feel a troubled feeling that doesn't belong to you. A short while later, you hear the voice again.)~
@51   = ~No. Even if I knew it, I would not tell. Do not see it as an offense. I should not look for her. It is she who should look for me, who should understand the weight of her own burden. I really desire to see her again but... but it is not the time. If fate will be kind enough, we will meet her. Maybe she has changed... I do not know.~
@52   = ~I know that I do not tell you too many details. Please, accept this situation as it is. I am sorry.~
@53   = ~I cannot be killed, assassinated, burned or shattered. I cannot die of old age, a disease or someone's wish. But... I will die when my creator dies. My existence is proof of her existence.~
@54   = ~So there's no use in denying her existence, right? Surely she's living somewhere.~
@55   = ~I'd like to ask you another question, please.~
@56   = ~That is correct: she exists. If I disappear suddenly, if you feel something changed and I do not respond, that means my creator died and so did I. We still share the same existence, the same breath gives us energy, the same blood flows in our veins, moved by the same heart. Still, we live apart.~
@57   = ~I have seen those images, but I am not sure if those are your real dreams. It is connected with your heritage, with an essence that flows in your blood, but also with a fate that awaits you, with a mage, with a dead god, with your siblings and with a Tree of Life that may die in the coming cold days.~
@58   = ~Are you able to stop these images?~
@59   = ~Can you tell me where this mage is from my dreams?~
@60   = ~The tree of what? What are you talking about?~
@61   = ~Can you see what will happen in the future, or something like that?~
@62   = ~I want to ask you another question, Dream. Do you mind...?~
@63   = ~No, I can't do that. I do not think anything can. It is forced upon you, it is a part of you, but in a similar way, it is not. I am sorry, you have to face it yourself.~
@64   = ~No, that is something I cannot do. You have to do everything on your own, you have to walk a path that you decide to tread. Your decision is your fate. It is all the same.~
@65   = ~The answer will come to you. Everything will be clear when the right day dawns.~
@66   = ~I see something...~
@67   = ~You will fight. Every day will become a new fight. You will have to face everything on your own: your enemies, your friends, your fate, the fate of others, the sunrise and a new dawn. Isn't your life already like that? Partly yes. Still, you are able to fight, you already have the power of your decision in your hand. Fight, then. You can still breathe, <CHARNAME>.~
@68   = ~(The voice awaits your response.)~
@69   = ~Can you stop those images that appear in my dreams?~
@70   = ~Are you able to tell me where this mage is from my dreams?~
@71   = ~What kind of tree did you mention in the beginning? What were you talking about?~
@72   = ~Are you able to see the future and tell me what will happen?~
@73   = ~I want to ask you about something different, Dream. Do you mind...?~
@74   = ~I observe and sleep. That is all I do.~
@75   = ~What I experienced...~
@76   = ~I was a child, I was born with my creator. She is the one who gave me birth, who gave me my first images. During the first night of her life, when she fell asleep, the very first image appeared in her mind: the image of a brand new world, a dream about the only world she knew: the body of her mother. Isn't it beautiful? Of course it is.~
@77   = ~I drank her mother's milk with her, I ate the first soup with her, I experienced everything she did. Not exactly the same way. It was still a bit different, all those things appearing in her mind. Soon, I was able to understand everything perfectly. We were one, and I was like her shadow. Not the evil inverse, but a companion.~
@78   = ~But was she always like that?~
@79   = ~I asked about you, not about that woman.~
@80   = ~What happened then?~
@81   = ~Then we were the same. I was an image of her, a reflection, a simulacrum.~
@82   = ~She was a really cheerful girl, but one moment of her life changed something. She wanted to hide this change, but such a moment can cause great wounds in a child's mind.~
@83   = ~Both her parents died, bitten to death by wolves. Their corpses lay in a pool of blood, partly eaten, without eyes, with some bare bones. They were also partly dismembered. What was worse, she was the first to discover the bodies. At that moment, I was fed with sadness and tears. From an innocent child, she became crushed by the sight, a victim. She was unable to stand.~
@84   = ~It must have been a great tragedy. Is this the event that changed her, then?~
@85   = ~She was weak, then. Tragedies like that happen.~
@86   = ~Partly yes. A single color may have different shades. The death of her parents gave me two new shades: deep sadness and grief.~
@87   = ~She whispered to herself. She imagined their death. She even thought she should have died that day with her parents. This took away part of her childhood. Maybe it was an initiation? Maybe it was why everything turn out to be a nightmare? Since she believed in it, maybe it became the truth because of that. However, this part of her I can still understand. It's not yet the moment where she changed so much.~
@88   = ~(The voice stays silent for a moment, but after few seconds, it continues.)~
@89   = ~It probably sounds more a history of that little girl, but you should understand that our characters were the same then. Imagine two candles, lit at the same moment, and consumed by fire. If the wind blows, both flames will go out.~
@90   = ~It is end of the story for now. I need some rest. I will sleep now. I need it...~
@91   = ~It is not like that. She was a child who never deserved that fate. I wish her parents never died...~
@92   = ~Since you do not understand this part, there is no point in continuing it now. I will fall asleep now. I need some rest.~
@93   = ~Yes, you do not know what happened with my creator and me after the death of her parents. Her life changed in almost every aspect.~
@94   = ~The one who was to take care of her was her mother's friend. She was an adept of magic. She realized that in my master's hands lay a great potential. She decided to teach her the magical arts, so the girl's everyday life was filled with studying alchemy, witchcraft, reading ancient runes, arcane literature and spellbooks. It was not a great burden for her. She even enjoyed it. With every piece of knowledge, I, too, became wiser. She also studied ancient myths and legends, which made her dreams more colorful.~
@95   = ~So, that was like enchanting her own dreams. When she was learning and studying those fairy tales, she changed you. She enhanced you.~
@96   = ~Ok, can we skip to the main plot, please?~
@97   = ~Yes, that is what she did. That moment, I became something more than a simple dream.~
@98   = ~Her days were cheerful again. In a different way, but still, her mother's friend gave the child a home, food, a corner where she could hide from the cold and rainy days. Wasn't that all that this child needed? I think the answer is yes.~
@99   = ~One day a new tragedy arose. The child found a page of a journal. She did not even read it, but her mother's friend was very upset about it. She shouted at her. She even said that she was wrong, that this child did not have any potential. She bound her with a rope and locked her aaway. That night, my creator wanted tu run away from the house.~
@100  = ~Did she succeed?~
@101  = ~What happened next?~
@102  = ~Ok, now tell me the most important fact and let's end this story. We should move.~
@103  = ~She burned the rope with a magical spell and ran away. Later, she heard that her former host had died. Her mother's friend was found dead, but that's not the main point of the story. The girl ran throughout the night... she cried again... her heart was hurt. Another nightmare happened.~
@104  = ~She entered the forest, running for a long time. I didn't know what she was doing. From that point on, my memories are blurred. I do not remember much. Everything is bathed in a mist through which I am unable to see. It's like looking at the shadows. I tried to talk to my creator using her dreams. I wanted to understand her thoughts, but they were so chaotic, filled with grief, sadness and some wrath. She wanted everything to change, and the means of reaching that goal was less important... this is the only thing I think I know. Everything else was hidden from me.~
@105  = ~That is what happened. It made another part in me. A part full of confusion, curiosity and loneliness.~
@106  = ~She ran away. She cried and changed, entered a dark forest. Since she ran through it, I was almost unable to understand her. Her thoughts changed, they were bathed in mist. That night, a confused and lonely part of me was born. She made a kind of barrier. I could see only shadows of the world in which she lived.~
@107  = ~I started the story, so now I shouldn't stop since I have not yet reached the end. It is not an easy thing to face all this... these ghosts of the past.~
@108  = ~She lived in a forest for a long time. When she was eighteen years old, she met a sixteen year old boy. He entered the forest and accidently their paths crossed. They talked a lot, spent time together. He was still a youngster, but they kissed and touched each other. She felt different during that time. I could not see everything clearly since I was caged inside of her, but I sensed the difference. I could not see, but I tasted what she tasted; this was something you call desire and... maybe love. I do not know. It is hard to define it, moreso since I am unsure if I had ever felt it before.~
@109  = ~A day or two later he said something to my creator - he said that she was missing something, that he felt that there was a missing piece of her inside. I do not know what happened then. I can only guess, but it is nothing I can say. That moment, I was caged in so deeply that I was not able to see anything, to feel, taste or hear. I was thrown into oblivion.~
@110  = ~But you didn't die then. I can talk with you to<DAYNIGHT>, so it's quite obvious.~
@111  = ~I do not know what happened to my creator. She had changed.~
@112  = ~One night, I woke up. I was surrounded by darkness, humid air and a searing pain inside me. I had flesh, though not the kind you have. I was able to change my shape, I could turn into every dream, look like a memory or my creator's wish. When I looked around, I realized that I was left in a cave. There were many crystals in there as well. Later, that place became the mine at Innershade.~
@113  = ~When no one saw me, I visited my creator's tower, but she was not there. Everything was different. I could not sleep anymore, not after all that had happened.~
@114  = ~Then, I met you. Even more changes appeared.~
@115  = ~I understand. Thank you for telling me this story.~
@116  = ~Yeah... let's go now.~
@117  = ~(The voice doesn't say a single word.)~
@118  = ~Does it really matter? You should know what happened, since your thoughts are my hideout. You decided to help me. But what now? Will I stay with you forever? I do not know. No, my creator's death can end this once and for all.~
@119  = ~So, I do not regret telling you my story. You wanted to listen, and that is a good enough reason. Another reason may be your own past.~
@120  = ~Have you seen my memories? My dreams?~
@121  = ~Well, we have to move now. I just wanted to know if you regret it.~
@122  = ~Yes. I see some of your past through a veil, some as clear as ice. I have seen the man who you killed in the temple under the city, I saw the man who raised you.~
@123  = ~You had a harsh past, but you never left your dreams and wishes behind. You are different from my creator--you were worth telling the story--but still I do not see my creator as pathetic. I cannot think of her like that. She gave me birth. Not everyone is strong enough to stand up to fate or face the past. After telling you the story, I have to say that I understand my creator more.~
@124  = ~Her past was like a nightmare. She wanted to leave... all she wanted was to live peacefully, to have a life of her own. A life with dignity and hope, instead of humiliation and tears.~
@125  = ~You know, people are like that. They make mistakes, they want to reach happiness, and sometimes they do not care about other things they may lose.~
@126  = ~She was weak. People are like that, and that's something that will never change. Pathetic animals that don't see the simplest thing.~
@127  = ~So this is being human? Yes, the life of the living is fragile, they want to live their lives with a smile, but now I understand. That one may lose the way and the goal, and enter another nightmare.~
@128  = ~I wish I could talk with my creator once more.~
@129  = ~You say those words as though you were different. No matter what your heritage is, who your parents are, where you come from, the law of existence does not change. It is something I learned from both our talks and what I saw when I was part of my creator.~
@130  = ~We shall continue your journey.~
@131  = ~(The voice is silent for a moment. After a moment or two, you hear it again.) We shall move, then.~
@132  = ~It is because you deserved that, but now I have nothing to tell you about my past. This story never reached its finale. The epilogue is yet to come, by either her death and mine, or our reunion. No one can know what will happen. All that is left is hope, but sometimes it is too little to force something to happen.~
@133  = ~I would like to remain silent about that. You have shown me another thing, something she did not, but now I want to remain in silence for a bit.~
@134  = ~Go back to your reality then. (After you hear those words, only silence remains.)~
