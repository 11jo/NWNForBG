@0 = ~Welcome to the Gauntlet. I am the healer and will tend to your wounds if you need me to do so. You know the rules of the pit, I believe?~
@1 = ~I will fight for my first medal.~
@2 = ~I'm ready to try for the next medal round.~
@3 = ~What is your job? Do you fight?~
@4 = ~What are the rules?~
@5 = ~I ask that you heal me.~
@6 = ~See ya.~
@7 = ~NP: Very good. You will fight Hrask. Good luck.~ /*Very well. I do as you wish.*/
@8 = ~I am sorry, Fashi has already been challenged. You will have to wait to attempt this round.~
@9 = ~Prepare. Fashi has readied himself and awaits you.~
@10 = ~NP: Sorry, but Agar just finished the fight, he needs some time to recover. Wait if you want to fight him.~ /*I am sorry, Agar is already in battle. You will have to wait if you want to challenge him.*/
@11 = ~Ready yourself. Agar awaits in the Pit.~
@12 = ~NP: Sorry, but Clodus has already been summoned by another fighter. You will have to fight him later, unless he is defeated.~ /*I am sorry, but Claudus is already in battle. You will have to wait to challenge him, unless he is defeated.*/
@13 = ~So, you are going to fight Claudus. I wish you the best of luck. He has all the odds on his side.~
@14 = ~You will keep the battle fair, won't you?~
@15 = ~Bring him on!~
@16 = ~NP: No, no, I'm both a healer and a judge, sort of. I make sure nobody dies and I make sure the fight is fair. In any case, I'm trying. Do you want good advice? Before the fight, ask the people about the fighters. That's all I wanted to say.~ /*No, no, I am the healer and a referee, of sorts. I make sure no one actually dies - well, animals or henchmen companions will - and I make sure the fights are fair.*/
@17 = ~NP: The rules are simple. You and your weapons against the gladiator and his weapons, and no more than one duel per day. You need to fight until you defeat all opponents. Everything can be used in the arena, except for potions and pre-cast spells. All participants are cast a dispel magic spell before the battle. You can not run away from the arena during the battle, if you run away from the arena, consider the battle lost. There are no prizes, but Clodus promised to give the Naked Board to whoever beats him. So far no one has been able to.~ /*You fight until you defeat all your opponents. Anything goes in the pit, but no advance spells or potions can be in effect. All combatants have Dispel Magic cast on them at entry.*/
@18 = ~Why is he unbeatable?~
@19 = ~Very well. Mind that you hold still a moment. There, that should do it.~
@20 = ~As you will. The fighters will wait for another challenger.~
@21 = ~I have the power to do so, but I am... restricted, a little in this instance. Claudus pays for all of this, you understand. You... understand?~
@22 = ~It should be fair. You know that.~
@23 = ~NP: I will pay you. 400 gold - and you will ensure a fair fight.~ /*I can pay you. 400 gold will get you away.*/
@24 = ~NP: It's a big risk for me... But I think... I think I should work hard for a change. You're right. Fine. Get ready to meet him. I will dispel the magic from both of you. Don't miss this chance.~ /*It's a risk for me... but I suppose... I suppose I should do my job for a change. You're right...*/
@25 = ~You do not understand the place I am in. I wish I could help, but I can't. You will just have to try.~
@26 = ~NP: Perhaps... But it doesn't make me feel any more honest. But I could use the money... All right. Get ready to meet him. I will dispel the magic from both of you. Don't miss this chance.~ /*Perhaps... but this doesn't make me feel any more honest. But the money could help me...*/
@27 = ~That is a discussion we can have when you fight him. Until then, you just leave it alone.~
@28 = ~NP: Sorry, but your duel with Hrask ended recently, the fighters need rest, come back tomorrow.~ /*I'm sorry, I am merely supposed to direct you to Lady Aribeth. Anything else you will have to investigate on your own.*/
@29 = ~So, Claudus finally falls. Good. I was sick of listening to him. Didn't pay me enough to cover his lies forever.~
@30 = ~NP: Only<CHARNAME> I will only talk to him.~ /*Now you make fun of me. So be it, <CHARNAME>, I shall speak plainly.*/
@31 = ~NP: You won and earned the right to fight a stronger opponent. But according to our rules, the next fight can take place no earlier than the next day, the fighters must rest. And now let me congratulate you on your victory and present this medal.~ /*The Mask has been recovered and is now in your possession. It should probably be brought back to Ayala and turned over to her, unless you wish to keep it.*/
@32 = ~NP: You lost the fight, however, you can try to win another time. But according to our rules, the next fight can take place no earlier than the next day, the fighters must rest.~ /*It appears this rock face could be ascended into the ruins above, though not without some risk of injury from falling.*/
@33 = ~NP: Wow, we have a new champion! You defeated Klodus himself and became the champion of the Gauntlet, now the tavern is yours, talk to the bartender upstairs, he will explain everything to you. In addition, let me congratulate you on your victory and present you with the badge of the champion.~ /*This huge, one handed half orc stares at you with a grimace, trying to decide if he recognizes you or not. "You no allowed out. There be ban on streets."*/
@34 = ~NP: What a misfortune, one of our fighters died! I'm leaving and will no longer fight in the arena. Let someone else do it if the authorities do not close this place at all.~ /*All our weapons and armor have been sent to the battle fronts, unfortunately. The only thing I have left are these potions.*/
@35 = ~NP: Scoundrels, you killed Klodus! I'm leaving and will no longer fight in the arena. Let someone else do it if the authorities do not close this place at all.~ /*I... I guess I don't have much choice. I'm not a fighter. If you want anything else, you get it your own damn self.*/
