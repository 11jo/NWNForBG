@0 = ~I am undone... take your bow, friend. You have your traitor. What now, I wonder?~ [DESTH161]
@1 = ~You will be taken back to face judgment.~
@2 = ~I should end your life right now.~
@3 = ~You will have to explain yourself, Desther.~
@4 = ~NP: Yeah, Nasher wants me alive, doesn't he? He'll want reasons and excuses. He'll want a scoundrel to throw to the mob. I think I'll be executed to placate the people, but that doesn't change anything. There will be more to come. You don't understand anything!~ /*Yes, Nasher will want me alive, won't he? He'll want reasons and justification. He'll want a villain to give to the mob.*/
@5 = ~NP: What does that prove? No, Nasher wants me alive. He'll want reasons and excuses. He'll want a scoundrel he can throw to the mob. I think I'll be executed to placate the people, but that doesn't change anything. There will be more to come. You don't understand anything!~ /*And what would that prove? No, Nasher will want me alive. He'll want reasons and justification. He'll want a villain to give to the mob.*/
@6 = ~You have questions, of course, but I don't have answers. I will not give you that satisfaction, nor will I give it to the mob that awaits in Neverwinter. Your victory shall be hollow.~
@7 = ~Where the cure?~
@8 = ~Who you serve?~
@9 = ~Why was Neverwinter attacked? Why did you spread the plague?~
@10 = ~What about Fenthick? Your trickery may damn him, too.~
@11 = ~NP: Oh, yeah, sure, the cure. Don't worry. It's right here. But it doesn't matter. The plague would have stopped soon enough without my false Helmites spreading it. You may be able to save some of the seriously ill, but the blow is already struck. The plague has sapped the city's strength. It has done its work.~ /*Of course, the cure. Don't you worry. It is here. Not that it matters. The plague would have ended soon enough without my False Helmites spreading it.*/
@12 = ~I have the cure. When you return me to Lord Nasher, the cure will be delivered as well. No need to scramble about searching. I have no more reason to defy you now.~
@13 = ~Shut up. I'm going to look around this place before I take you back.~
@14 = ~Enough! I'm taking you back to Neverwinter right now!~
@15 = ~We are the People of the Eye. We are the ones who follow. We are the servants of the Old Ones, and you are merely cattle! You cannot understand!~
@16 = ~What are the Old Ones! Tell me!~
@17 = ~How big is your group? How many "People of the Eye" are there?~
@18 = ~NP: Why do cities get attacked in the first place? To weaken it and make the attacker stronger. Now Neverwinter is but a shadow of its former glory, and an undeserved one at that! You'll see! It was my honor to spread the great disease! It has exhausted you and now feeds your doom! The souls of the dead will give strength to my masters!~ /*Why is anything ever attacked? To weaken it, and strengthen the attacker. Neverwinter is a shadow of its former glory - glory undeserved!*/
@19 = ~If you did not start the plague, who did?~
@20 = ~Explain what you mean! What did the plague do?~
@21 = ~NP: Fine! Let this plague-ridden rabble thirst for blood! Let them demand the most brutal carnage! What do I care?! Fentick was a fine instrument. He wanted so much to believe in someone else's faith. And now he's almost an accomplice, and at the very least he's shown criminal credulity. Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what happens to people who pounce on the best among them? Now they will see traitors everywhere. Their spirits will weaken even more.~ /*Tell me, <CHARNAME>, what does it do to a people when they turn on the best among them? They shall see traitors everywhere now. Their spirit will weaken even further.*/
@22 = ~Ever the mercenary. By all means, loot what you must. I am quite incapacitated. Come talk to me when you want to leave. I'm sure Lord Nasher is waiting.~
@23 = ~Don't rush on my account. I know what awaits me. My fate is sealed. There's comfort in that. It is better, I'll wager, than the uncertainty awaiting you.~
@24 = ~NP: Save your anger, you'll get nothing from me. I can't explain it to you. Will an ant understand the wheel that crushes it? Would a vulture understand a spear that pierces him? You are unable to understand my lords, and I will not speak of them. You may threaten me, let Nasher bring his executioners, but you will not hear a word from me.~ /*Save your wrath, you will get no satisfaction from me. I cannot explain it to you. Does the ant understand the wagon rolling above? Does the boar understand the arrow piercing through?*/
@25 = ~NP: Our name is legion, and we are growing in number. Eventually, all those who wish to survive will join us. Go with the flow or you will drown! You have defeated my false Helmites, but new servants will take their place. Our work here is done - our defeat means nothing.~ /*We are legion, always growing in number. In the end, all who wish to survive will become as we. Move with the tide or be drowned within it.*/
@26 = ~I will say nothing! You are like a child, begging for explanations but understanding nothing. You are doomed, and there is nothing you can do! You will see!~
@27 = ~I have other questions.~
@28 = ~You delay in returning me to Nasher and the precious Lady Aribeth. Hurry with your looting and let this farce come to an end.~ [DESTH162]
