@0 = ~Can I help you? No, what am I talking about? I can't even help myself. I can't even hide in my own house. Can't go home to the Beggar's Nest because of zombies, can't get out of the city because of the quarantine... what's a guy supposed to do? Just choke on stink of the corpse-fires, I guess.~ 
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Maybe I could help you out?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Sorry, I don't mean to be rude to you, but I can't think about anything but my distress right now.~ 
@5 = ~I don't know how you could. I don't know anyone that can take on an army of zombies by themselves. The Beggar's Nest is completely overrun... my home is overrun...~
@6 = ~Farewell, then. I'll just stay here... nowhere else to go...~
@7 = ~I never thought I'd be happy to be going back to the Beggar's Nest.~
@8 = ~It's over? I mean, the plague is still going, sure, but at least I can go home. The zombies in the Beggar's Nest were just a nightmare I didn't need. Thank you.~
