@0 = ~You have come to put down the dread Sir Karathis, have you?~ [NWKAR053]
@1 = ~I've come to talk, nothing more.~
@2 = ~You failed the boys of Port Llast. Prepare to die.~
@3 = ~Neurik gave me these silver charms. I think I can help...~
@4 = ~Stay here, Sir Karathis. Perhaps I can help you yet.~
@5 = ~What do you want?!~
@6 = ~Can you tell me what happened?~
@7 = ~Help me fake your death and you can go free.~
@8 = ~If you come here out of honor, then let us fight with honor, for that I have not lost...~
@9 = ~You come to me with silver? Do you not remember that I was a werewolf hunter? That silver would be poison to me now.~
@10 = ~This is magic, representative of Tyr's justice.~
@11 = ~If it was normal silver, perhaps, but this bears Neurik's holy blessing.~
@12 = ~I offer you a choice, Karathis - Take it or I kill you.~
@13 = ~Enough about cures and poisons, then - let us fight as warriors!~
@14 = ~With what? An army or a cure?~
@15 = ~And would you believe me when I told the truth? Don't mark me for a fool.~
@16 = ~Seriously - I don't know what happened.~
@17 = ~A deceiver made me what I am today! I may look like the Black Wolf, but I shan't become like him! Take your offers elsewhere.~
@18 = ~Justice, you say? If it slays the wicked and cures the righteous, then I shall gladly use this charm. I know my heart!~
@19 = ~Holy-charmed silver, is it? If it slays the wicked and cures the righteous, than I shall use this charm. I know my heart!~
@20 = ~Then I shall use your filthy charm. I am a servant of my god, however, and it is by his hand that I shall make miracles of your base attempts!~
@21 = ~Though my mind rebels, my heart knows the better - you are being... sincere. Aren't you? Fine. I will recount the sad tale. I have been hunting werewolves for most of my adventuring career, and was in fact knighted for this duty I have placed upon myself. But I was to face my greatest challenge with the Black Wolf. I brought four young men of Port Llast - Urth, Bran, Geth, and Ander - to help me.~ 
@22 = ~But with tragic irony, I was afflicted with lycanthropy, and I cursed them to the same in turn, all save the youngest, Ander. It has been a dark day ever since.~
@23 = ~Do you know the identity of the Black Wolf?~
@24 = ~I believe that I do, but I would keep that secret as my own - perhaps I might use it as a key to restore my humanity.~
@25 = ~I have regained control. You need no longer attack me!~ [NWKAR052]
@26 = ~There, that should be proof enough of my innocence. Take this journal I have penned and give it to Neurik. It tells the truth of what has happened. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my order and seek penance for taking on the shape of my enemy. Read my journal well and act upon it.~ 

@28 = ~Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can't control... Myself!~ [NWKAR051]
@29 = ~Prepare to die.~
