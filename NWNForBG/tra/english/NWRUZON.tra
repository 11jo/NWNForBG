@0 = ~Go on. Leave us. Gonmir's dead and the rest of us will follow him shortly. Leave me be.~
@1 = ~Do you need any help?~
@2 = ~What exactly is it you do here?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~I'm all right. When I get back to the Well, Neurik will heal me. Gonmir, he's not so lucky.~
@5 = ~NP: Gonmir and I were wounded during the battle for the fort. They sent us back to the Well and Newrick healed us. Then we came back and fought again. It looks like Gonmir is on his last journey. He's dead. One of those barbarians hit him with an arrow. I thought he'd make it, but, uh.~ /*Gonmir and I were wounded again during the fighting at the Fort. They send us back to the Well and Neurik heals us. Then we come back and fight some more.*/
@6 = ~The Fort?~
@7 = ~Whatever. I'm not waiting around here to die, I'm getting back to the Well.~
@8 = ~NP: Yeah, Fort Ilkard. It's down the road. But I wouldn't go there if I were you, unless you're a fighter.~ /*Yeah, Fort Ilkard. It is just down the road. I'd stay clear of it though, if you're not a fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN>.*/
