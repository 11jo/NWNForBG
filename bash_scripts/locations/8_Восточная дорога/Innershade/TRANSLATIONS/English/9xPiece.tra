@0    = ~Why should I chase the memories I had?
Why should I look after those times?
I will forget all those moments past,
For now, forever, for peace of mind.~
@1    = ~I ran to catch and embrace my wishes,
I tried to become those visions I had.
Why will I never succeed? Tell me why.
The answers will never appear, I left them...
I left them behind.~
@2    = ~Every night I see my paradise,
Every night I smile at you in there.
Why do you want to run away from me?
Come, I will give you my kiss again.~
@3    = ~Fear and mystery I face night by night,
The secret of my own fangs I try to hide.
They attack every night, while the moon shines,
Revealing the truth of my death.~
@4    = ~Why have I lost my name? I do not know.
Why I do not see your face? I will not know.
Answers are alive, but what do they mean?
That there are still words to be said.~
