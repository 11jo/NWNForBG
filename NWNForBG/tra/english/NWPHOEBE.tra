@0 = ~What do you want? I'm no guard, I can't help you. All I can do is wait for the plague to get me, and I can't even do that from my own bed. I don't suppose you'd feel any better yourself if you'd lost your home, let alone been chased out by zombies. It's just the Beggar's Nest, I know, but it's better than sitting here smelling the corpses burn.~ /*I don't suppose you'd feel any better yourself if you'd lost your home, let alone been chased out by zombies.

@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Maybe I could help you out?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~No, please, I don't want to think about this anymore than I have to.~
@5 = ~Why would you help me? I'm just a lowly peasant from the Beggar's Nest. Half the city is probably happy to see the place overrun, even if it was by zombies. Just leave me. please.~ /*Why would you help me? I'm just a lowly peasant from the Beggar's Nest. Half the city is probably happy to see the place overrun, even if it was by zombies.*/
@6 = ~Yeah, just leave me here. I've nowhere else to go.~
@7 = ~Please don't hurt me. Haven't I suffered enough? I have nothing left. Not even a place of my own to lay down and die.

@8 = ~The zombies are all gone? I don't know what to say. I am so happy to be able to go home... I mean, it's just the Beggar's Nest... but it's all I've got left.~
