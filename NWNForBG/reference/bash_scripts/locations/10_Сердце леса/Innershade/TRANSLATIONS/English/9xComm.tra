@0    = ~Oh, hello. Isn't it a lovely <DAYNIGHT> to<DAYNIGHT>? So, you've decided to visit Innershade, <SIRMAAM>? That's kind of you, but you probably won't find much fun here. Oh, if you want a respite from the crowded towns, and to enjoy some peace and solitude, it's the right place! Regardless, we welcome you with a smile.~
@1    = ~Why are you so happy? Did something happen?~
@2    = ~What can I find in Innershade? Any merchants? I mean those with interesting wares, not timber merchants.~
@3    = ~I have to go!~
@4    = ~Not really. I just enjoy every day. They call me "Cheerful Sue". I really like to cheer people up! Humans, elves, gnomes, dwarves - all should find some time for a smile in their lives.~
@5    = ~I see... So, what can I find in this village? Are there any merchants?~
@6    = ~I have to go now. Bye!~
@7    = ~Well, yes! If you are hungry, ask for Bartec, the food merchant. If you need some fair weaponry or armor, you should visit Eva, our blacksmith. She is such an interesting person!~
@8    = ~Well, if you are fishing for gossip, stories and legends, you should speak with a child called Little Bud. He lives near the wood chopper's tent. For a coin, Bud will tell you an interesting story. He knows quite a few enjoyable ones!~
@9    = ~I see. Thank you. By the way, you seem to be quite... full of enthusiasm. Has something happened? Why are you so happy?~
@10   = ~I have to go now. Goodbye.~
@11   = ~Really? A pity...~
@12   = ~Well, have a great <DAYNIGHT> then! I hope you will have some fun, <SIRMAAM>!~
@13   = ~(You see a little boy singing a song.)~
@14   = ~'Knight with a silver shield I once did know,
In honor he lived, with friends he laughed.
Betrayed he was, by friend stabbed to death,
Yet I still visit his grave, remember his name.'~
@15   = ~' My friend, dear Mary Sue, play with me,
Let us visit caves, play in the trees together,
Let us fight with monsters, here and there,
I believe thou wilt protect me until the night ends! '~
@16   = ~'Soul wanders near the pool, sings about you,
Traces the line of the water, smiles at it,
Will you save him a friend of mine?
Will you end this before the day comes?'~
@17   = ~'To th' colorful land I send thee,
To th' lakes of red, to places hidden.
Dance with th' sparks to the end of the day,
Unless thou wilt find the way out
-of this paradise!'~
@18   = ~I am sorry, but I am afraid of strangers... and spiders! Yuck! You have one on your arm! Please, stay away! It looks at me! (Suddenly, the expression on the man's face changes.)~
@19   = ~You called me mad, spider? Bah! You are the most uncultured and insolent representative of Arachnida I have ever met! Take this <PRO_RACE> of yours and leave. (This man appears to be either drunk or insane.)~
@20   = ~I think this is the greatest place I have ever lived. There are no beggars here, no criminals... Well, excluding the thing in the mines, but still I am happy. Hmm... however, I should focus on the tasks I have to do today.~
@21   = ~Hello, <SIRMAAM>. You look like an adventurer. I would like to ask you something. You see, I was wondering... Are Baldur's Gate and Athkatla much bigger than Innershade? I have lived in the countryside since I was born, and it's hard for me to imagine what a city looks like.~
@22   = ~Well, those you mentioned are much larger. Hundreds or even thousands of people 
live in them. And there are fewer trees, and you can decide which of many taverns you would like to visit.~
@23   = ~Perhaps this is not something I should to ask, but why don't you see them for yourself? You look to be a fair and hale man. If you are really curious, then just make a little adventure for yourself.~
@24   = ~Get out of my way. I do not wish to talk with you.~
@25   = ~Really? Wow! They must be really huge. A pity there are few trees in them, but to be honest, after all these years in the countryside, I wouldn't miss them! I wish I had tried some other way of living!~
@26   = ~But this place is much better than any city, believe me.~
@27   = ~If you really want, you can still give it a try. Why don't you make a little adventure for yourself, and visit one of those cities?~
@28   = ~Whatever. I have to go.~
@29   = ~An adventure, you say... But do you really think I would able to survive on the road? What if bandits or wolves attack me?~
@30   = ~What's the problem? Buy yourself a sword and fight. I can see your arm... you have quite impressive muscles there. A small fight here and there shouldn't be a problem.~
@31   = ~Well, on second thought, this place is much more cozy and nice than a crowded city.~
@32   = ~Who cares? I have to go.~
@33   = ~You know, you're right! I will take my money, buy one of Eva's best swords, and visit Athkatla or some other city! Maybe I will even decide to become an adventurer like you. I am sick of this tedious life in the countryside! Thank you for your encouraging words.~
@34   = ~I see... Perhaps I should remain in this village...I'm probably not suited for the life of a traveler.~
@35   = ~Well, those certainly weren't encouraging words!~
@36   = ~What a boring <DAYNIGHT>, isn't it?~
@37   = ~I am quite busy! Do you need something? If not, can you just leave me be?~
@38   = ~I have a question. Who are you?~
@39   = ~Where I can find Eva?~
@40   = ~Do you think I look nice in this clothing?~
@41   = ~I'll leave you then.~
@42   = ~That's what you wanted to know? Get lost! I am busy. Just ask someone else!~
@43   = ~Thank you for not wasting my time. I do not know why people always ask me such frivolous things!~
