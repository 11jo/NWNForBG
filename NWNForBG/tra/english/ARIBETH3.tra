@0 = ~Greetings, <CHARNAME>. Preparations are well under way for the ritual. If all goes well, we will have the cure in just a few moments.~ [ARIBE170]
@1 = ~I must say, I knew you would be instrumental in this cause. You've always presented the confident look of a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of action.~ [ARIBE171]
@2 = ~Is there anything I should do? What happens now?~
@3 = ~I'm glad this mess is over with. When will I be rewarded?~
@4 = ~You needn't worry about anything. Your efforts got us this far, and now the ritual will take care of the rest. Following that, I will see to your reward.~ [ARIBE172]
@5 = ~Such impatience does not suit you. You will see the fruits of your labors when the ritual is complete.~ [ARIBE213]
@6 = ~For now, you can leave what must be done to us. You've earned the right to bear witness, however, and I'm sure the others would say the same.~ [ARIBE173]
@7 = ~MT: Fentik says that he revealed to Dester the secret of the castle's defensive spells.~ /*Fenthick says that he gave his ward key to Desther.*/
@8 = ~I have questions about the ritual.~
@9 = ~Will things be getting back to normal now?~
@10 = ~MT: I have questions about those who are here.~ /*I have questions about the region.*/
@11 = ~Goodbye.~
@12 = ~I am aware. Our guards here are very observant. There will be consequences, but not for now. There are more important things at hand.~ [ARIBE174]
@13 = ~I will try to explain. Is there anything specific you wish to know?~ [ARIBE177]
@14 = ~What is involved in the ritual?~
@15 = ~What form will the cure take?~
@16 = ~Well, once we have the cure in hand we will determine the best way to get it to the most people as soon as possible.~ [ARIBE186]
@17 = ~I'm certain they can speak for themselves, but I will answer any questions you have.~ [ARIBE194]
@18 = ~How is Lord Nasher faring?~
@19 = ~Has your opinion of Desther changed any?~
@20 = ~Will your relationship with Fenthick improve now?~
@21 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@22 = ~Yes, I think the time for talk has passed. You have spoken with everyone and we are ready. The ritual will commence now.~ [ARIBE203]
@23 = ~Yes, farewell for now. There is much I must do to prepare for the casting to come. The incantations are very complex.~ [ARIBE204]
@24 = ~We will watch Desther carefully, but he is needed for the incantations and I will not risk his temperamental nature and spoil our chance for a cure.~ [ARIBE175]
@25 = ~Well, several of our Tyrran priests have already begun preparations. Their meditation will allow the different components to be combined smoothly.~ [ARIBE178]
@26 = ~Well, we have prepared a small container. The mixture itself will be fairly unspectacular to look at, despite the importance of it.~ [ARIBE183]
@27 = ~It will take time, so we'll treat the most severe cases of plague first, regardless of station. I just hope... well... we'll worry about other things later.~ [ARIBE187]
@28 = ~What concerns you, Aribeth? Tell me.~
@29 = ~MT: I am an elf, just like you. Tell me what's bothering you.~ /*I am a fellow elf. Tell me what your worry is.*/
@30 = ~You should really ask him that. He despises being thought of as weak, and would much prefer to be involved in any talk of his health.~ [ARIBE195]
@31 = ~I would ask whether your opinion of him has suffered. It was your efforts that brought us this far. His claims of action seem based on your results.~ [ARIBE196]
@32 = ~This time has been... difficult, and our difference of opinion made it more so. Fenthick and I have had little to speak of besides the plague.~ [ARIBE199]
@33 = ~As you will. What do you want me to say?~ [ARIBE184]
@34 = ~You should speak with the others. No doubt they will each have their own feelings about how our situation has changed.~ [ARIBE211]
@35 = ~Fenthick takes foolish risks, but I will not allow any harm to come from this. The plague will not divide the living.~ [ARIBE176]
@36 = ~Desther, Fenthick and I will all begin the main incantations as soon as we are prepared. If all goes well, we'll have the cure in mere moments.~ [ARIBE179]
@37 = ~We are very near our goal but... I can't help but worry about the effects of the plague. There is a great scar across Neverwinter.~ [ARIBE188]
@38 = ~It's not really appropriate to speak of these things right now. It's not important. We will deal with everything as it comes.~ [ARIBE191]
@39 = ~Will you be able to undestand, I wonder? A great scar has been carved across the heart of Neverwinter. Perhaps you also see it?~ [ARIBE193]
@40 = ~While you searched, his Helmites blessed. While you fought, his Helmites blessed. The comfort he brought will pale next to the actual cure you have provided.~ [ARIBE197]
@41 = ~I understand why he vests so much hope in Desther, but I could not. I know the power of faith, but you need to back it up with action.~ [ARIBE200]
@42 = ~None too soon for Lord Nasher; the plague has weakened him considerably. I think he almost considers it a personal insult to be seen this way.~ [ARIBE180]
@43 = ~I imagine he's more used to a stand-up fight.~
@44 = ~Already I see the distrust. The mood of the city has changed. When all is done, the people will want someone to blame, and I don't know if we will find anyone.~ [ARIBE189]
@45 = ~Now, is there anything else? You should speak with the others if you have not done so. They would congratulate you, too.~ [ARIBE192]
@46 = ~Of course, he is needed for the final ritual, so I cannot dismiss him entirely. Fenthick also serves as his advocate, so he must be deserving of some respect.~ [ARIBE198]
@47 = ~Yes, I would agree. He is... archetypal. We are almost certain the plague was an attack, but he has no idea what kind of villain would stoop so low.~ [ARIBE181]
@48 = ~(ahem) I shouldn't ramble on like this when we are so close to a cure. This is a happy day, and we got here because of you.~ [ARIBE190]
@49 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. I have a moment to talk, but as soon as you have finished speaking with everyone we can begin the ceremony.~ [ARIBE216]
@50 = ~Hurry, get through the portal while I can still maintain it! Find the cure! Get Desther and... and Fenthick too. He may be under a spell or... I don't know.~ [ARIBE217]
@51 = ~Can you imagine? I must wish Fenthick harm rather than face the possibility that... that he might have known of this.~ [ARIBE218]
@52 = ~People maybe think he did. He always supported Desther.~
@53 = ~Fenthick has followed Desther? Let's hope he went to stop him.~
@54 = ~Do not say such things! It cannot be! He was mistaken! He was fooled! He was... He was... damn him...~ [ARIBE219]
@55 = ~What was he thinking? If he had a part in this... it hardly matters now... He looks like he fled with Desther. The people will not accept this action!~ [ARIBE232]
@56 = ~People won't let this pass. They have been denied a cure and they will want vengeance on the traitor and anyone that helped him... I... won't be able to protect him... I won't...~ [ARIBE220]
@57 = ~Perhaps... perhaps delivering Desther will mitigate things. Find him alive if you can. Find Fenthick and get him to... I don't know... I don't know what will help now.~ [ARIBE221]
@58 = ~What will happen to Fenthick?~
@59 = ~What are you going to do?~
@60 = ~Where does this portal go?~
@61 = ~If Desther and his Helmites are fake, where are the real ones?~
@62 = ~I... I don't know. People will think he's in league with the greatest threat we have ever known... I don't know...~ [ARIBE222]
@63 = ~I'll... I'll maintain the portal as long as I can, but it may be a while before we can send guards through. You'll have to go on your own.~ [ARIBE225]
@64 = ~I don't know... it's hard to tell. I can't see through Desther's magic. It probably leads to wherever he and his false Helmites originally came from.~ [ARIBE227]
@65 = ~I don't know. Perhaps Desther killed them. It seems impossible. He came from Helm's Hold... if that great hall has fallen... this is an even greater tragedy.~ [ARIBE230]
@66 = ~He was mistaken... he was an advocate for a traitor. People will not understand his naivete... his trust. Could you blame them for finding a scapegoat?~ [ARIBE223]
@67 = ~I'll go as quick as I can. Maybe I can catch up.~
@68 = ~The city guards are needed elsewhere, so this task falls to you. Go, before the portal falls!~ [ARIBE224]
@69 = ~I'll also try to make this sound better than it is... I can't hide Fenthick's blind trust of Desther... but if I explain it in context... Maybe...~ [ARIBE226]
@70 = ~Desther claimed he came from Helm's Hold in the east, but I don't know how that could be true. They would have no part of a plot like this.~ [ARIBE228]
@71 = ~This is a huge undertaking... it seems like Desther has done all this to promote the plague... but why?! So many dead... now the Hold?~ [ARIBE231]
@72 = ~Wherever the portal leads, I am sure it will be dangerous. He must know we would send someone after him. Be careful.~ [ARIBE229]
@73 = ~MT: Do not have the time! You must find Dester! I can keep the portal open for now, but you need to hurry! Maybe you can find them quickly...~ [ARIBE233] /*There is no time! You must find Desther! I can maintain the portal for now, but you must hurry! If you find them soon enough, maybe...*/
@74 = ~Maybe Fenthick's actions will be overlooked... maybe he will be forgiven before the city looks for... vengeance instead of justice...~ [ARIBE234]
