@0 = ~Stop right where you are, citizen. Commoners are not allowed to enter the Blacklake district.~
@1 = ~I am a member of the city guard under Aribeth's command.~
@2 = ~You will let me pass or I'll get very angry, fool.~
@3 = ~NP: Why is the neighborhood closed?~ /*Why is it closed off?*/
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Hmmph. The city guard has so many new recruits, I can't even keep up. I think I heard of you, though.~
@6 = ~I've been commanded to find the Waterdhavian creatures. Have you heard anything about them?~
@7 = ~Anything of interest I should know about in Blacklake?~
@8 = ~I need some directions.~
@9 = ~Let me through the gate, then.~
@10 = ~Did you not hear what I said? Only guards and nobles are allowed into the Blacklake area. Period. Now begone.~
@11 = ~Seeing as I am under Aribeth's personal command, you may want to re-think that tone.~
@12 = ~NP: Fine, I'm leaving.~ /*Fine, I'm going.*/
@13 = ~NP: To keep the plague from affecting Neverwinter's most powerful citizens. So far, we've succeeded. But of course, that would be over quickly if we started letting in all the peasants who show up at the gates. So go back where you came from.~ /*That will change, of course, if we start letting every peasant that approaches the gate through. So return whence you came.*/
@14 = ~Yes, yes. On your way, then.~
@15 = ~I just heard that they're supposed to cure the plague or somesuch. I think it'd be a desperate fool who'd believe that. Monsters don't cure plagues.~
@16 = ~Have you heard any rumors about where they might be?~
@17 = ~Have you heard anything at all about the creatures?~
@18 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@19 = ~Well, there's that whole situation with Meldanen. Glad he isn't my problem. He's a strange one.~
@20 = ~Who is Meldanen?~
@21 = ~Anyone you know of in the Blacklake district who needs help?~
@22 = ~Are there any places of interest in the Blacklake district that I should visit?~
@23 = ~Where do you need to go?~
@24 = ~Where is the nearest tavern?~
@25 = ~Where is the nearest temple?~
@26 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@27 = ~Oh, the gate is already open. Just head on through.~
@28 = ~Sorry. No tales of monsters running about the district. Not that I've heard, anyway.~
@29 = ~Maybe you have heard of someone who might know more? Someone who's acting strangely.~
@30 = ~So, none of the nobles have reported seeing anything strange?~
@31 = ~Only that there was some accident when they were brought in, and now they're fled or lost or something. We aren't supposed to panic people by talking about that, though.~
@32 = ~Don't you find it sort of strange that the 'accident' happened as soon as the creatures made it into the city?~
@33 = ~Have you heard any leads on who might have been responsible for the 'accident'?~
@34 = ~NP: Come on, there's nothing to worry about. They say he's been dealt with. He was the biggest problem in Black Lake as far as I'm concerned. It's all pretty quiet now. Is there anything else you'd like to know?~ /*Ahh, it's not worth worrying about. He's been taken care of, I hear. He was the main problem in Blacklake, as far as I'm concerned. It's pretty quiet now.*/
@35 = ~You know good places to go here?~
@36 = ~NP: Hmph. It's a neighborhood of wealthy aristocrats, and they don't suffer from the plague at all, unlike the rest of the city. I personally am not worried about them at all. They also say old Samuel disappeared last week. No sign of him. Poor fellow probably fell into the lake.~ /*Hmph. It's just a district of rich nobles who aren't even suffering from the plague like the rest of the city. I wouldn't worry too much about them, myself.*/
@37 = ~Who's Samuel?~
@38 = ~You could always visit the zoo. It's run by some of the nobility and there is quite a selection of exotic animals.~
@39 = ~NP: Try the Naked Board. It's just north of here, should have everything you need. Anything else?~ /*Try the Board Laid Bare. It's just north of here and should have everything you need.*/
@40 = ~Not many shops in the area. Err... I guess you could try the Board Laid Bare. It's a tavern just north of here.~
@41 = ~Fine. Just don't make any trouble in the district.~
@42 = ~Acting strangely? Well... I suppose Meldanen would certainly qualify, although acting strange is nothing new for him. He's a wizard, they say... sort of an odd bird amongst the nobility.~
@43 = ~NP: Well, it's not like they come to the gate to chat with me and have a cup of tea, you know. Most of them hide in their mansions and shiver because they're afraid the pestilence will come to Blackshear, no matter what we do. But no... As said before, I haven't heard any stories of strange monsters in Chernozerye. Is there anything else you need?~ /*Well, it's not as if they come out to the gate to gossip with me and have tea, you know. Most of them are huddled in their big mansions terrified that the plague's going to enter Blacklake regardless of what we do.*/
@44 = ~NP: Yeah, sure, but what does that have to do with me? It all happened in the Heart of the City, far away from here. Actually, I don't really feel like talking about it anymore. It's none of my business. Is there anything else you need?~ /*Yeah, sure, but what does that mean to me? That all happened in the City Core, long ways from here.*/
@45 = ~NP: Actually, I don't have that kind of information. I don't know anything. Is there anything else you need?~ /*I'm not really privy to that kind of information. I haven't a clue.*/
@46 = ~What else do you want to know?~
@47 = ~NP: Okay, I guess there's no harm done. But I don't actually want to get struck by lightning or anything, hehe. The fact is, Meldanen is hoarding food. That's according to Formosa, one of the most annoying noblewomen in Blackzero. She says that the food should have fed the people of the town, and wants the sorcerer to give it to her. And she's going to get herself into a lot of trouble with her behavior.~ /*She says the food should be used to feed the city, wants to force the sorcerer to give it up. She's been stirring up quite a bit of trouble over it.*/
@48 = ~NP: I'm sorry, but I don't want the sorcerer to know I'm blabbing about him. Better a quiet mouse than a loud toad, you know. If you want to know more about it, talk to Formosa. I think you'll hear her yelling very quickly if you go out into the main square of the neighborhood. Sounds to me like it would be a good idea to have someone shut her up or something. Is there anything else you'd like to know?~ /*If you want to know more about it, you should talk to Formosa. You'll hear her screeching soon enough, I'd think, if you go near the district's main square. I wouldn't mind someone trying to rein her in, myself.*/
@49 = ~NP: I suppose there's no harm in telling. Especially to a pretty girl like you. Suna knows I'm not, uh. oh, never mind. The fact is, Meldanen is hoarding food. That's according to Formosa, one of the most annoying noblewomen in Black Lake. She says the food should have fed the people of the town, and wants the sorcerer to give it to her. And she's going to get herself into a lot of trouble with her behavior.~ /*She says the food should be used to feed the city, wants to force the sorcerer to give it up. She's been stirring up quite a bit of trouble over it.*/
@50 = ~NP: Oh, just one of the old guards. Turin was looking for him. If you're interested, you can talk to him-- he's on patrol around here somewhere, you bet he is. Patrolling the tavern, that's what. The Bare Board is where Turin spends his free time.~ /*Oh, just one of the older guards. I hear Thurin's been looking for him, though. If you're really interested you could talk to him... he'll be patrolling about, no doubt.*/
@51 = ~NP: There are no temples in the Black Lake area. The aristocracy doesn't have time for piety. Anything else?~ /*There are no temples in the Blacklake district. Nobility doesn't have time to be pious.*/
@52 = ~NP: You don't have to worry about him anymore. They say someone put him in his place or something. It's very peaceful in Chernozery now. Is there anything else you need?~ /*But, he's no longer a concern. I heard someone put him in his place, or something. The Blacklake is really quiet now.*/
@53 = ~NP: People say that Meldanen is hoarding food. Some people think he has something to share with the people. I don't know. But personally, I don't want to fight with Meldanen. Do you need anything else?~ /*People have been saying that Meldanen's hoarding food. Some think that he should share some of it with the common folk. I don't know. I wouldn't go messing with Meldanen, myself.*/
@54 = ~He's one of the noblemen, supposedly a wizard. Scary reputation. I, uh... probably shouldn't say much more than that, though.~
@55 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@56 = ~Come now, handsome. You can tell little old me.~
@57 = ~NP: If you want to know more about it, talk to Formosa. I think you'll hear her screaming very quickly if you go out to the main square of the neighborhood. Sounds to me like it would be nice if someone would shut her up or something. Is there anything else you'd like to know?~ /*If you want to know more about it, you should talk to Formosa. You'll hear her screeching soon enough, I'd think, if you go near the district's main square. I wouldn't mind someone trying to rein her in, myself.*/
@58 = ~Greetings to you. I swear, I've seen more traffic just recently than since the plague began.~
@59 = ~NP: But you have no reason to be here. They say Black Lake is quiet now. There was some trouble, like aristocrats stealing food or something, but it's all cleared up now. Maybe you had something to do with it? If so, that's good!~ /*Not much reason for you to be here, though. I hear the Blacklake is quiet now. There was some trouble with some nobles stealing food or something, but that's over with.*/
@60 = ~The gate is already open if you need to enter.~
@61 = ~You are here on militia business, I assume? Nobody else comes through this area except us guards.~
@62 = ~Fare you well. Perhaps we'll speak again.~
