@0 = ~Hail! You don't look like one of Kurth's or Baram's soldiers. Best stay off the streets if you can, then, stranger... it's not safe, as you can plainly see.~
@1 = ~What do you mean? Kurth's? Baram's?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Hmm. You really are a stranger, then, if you don't know what I speak of. Most sane folk of Luskan stay indoors, now, if they know what's good for them.~
@6 = ~Me? The name's Gregor. I was hired by the brothel, here, to try and keep some of the worse elements roaming the city from making their way to our doorstep.~
@7 = ~What brothel?~
@8 = ~NP: Who do you have to fight? What are these beings?~ /*What you means 'brother?' What is amulet?*/
@9 = ~If you like, go ahead.~
@10 = ~Do you know anything about cults in the city?~
@11 = ~What is going on in Luskan?~
@12 = ~Me new to city. Need directions.~
@13 = ~Aye, be safe.~
@14 = ~Miss Bela's, of course, on the island here. Kurth and Baram both have an interest in keeping it open... but there are enough vandals and thieves about, regardless.~
@15 = ~Hmmm. Can't say that I do. The Arcane Brotherhood is quite thorough in ensuring there's no groups of great power other than themselves.~
@16 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@17 = ~NP: You didnt come here to fight? Theyve been going on for two weeks now. The High Captains suddenly grabbed each others throats for no reason. Nobody knows why... Most people think they are crazy. Each High Captain has his own army and now they are tearing Luskan apart.~ /*Nobody knows why... most think they've gone insane. Each of the High Captains has their own army, however, and they've been tearing Luskan apart.*/
@18 = ~What they do to city?~
@19 = ~Can nobody stop the fighting?~
@20 = ~Tell me about these High Captains.~
@21 = ~NP: Yes, I think for a person like you, it may seem huge, right? Where do you want to go?~ /*Yes, I suppose it would seem large to someone like you, wouldn't it?*/
@22 = ~Where is the nearest inn?~
@23 = ~Where is the nearest temple?~
@24 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@25 = ~Just give me an overview of the area.~
@26 = ~Actually, I'd rather ask you about something else.~
@27 = ~Wererats. Lycanthropes. Baram's men. Seems like all of his soldiers are infected, now. Kurth's men have looted the city of enchanted weapons just to fight them.~
@28 = ~A group of wizards who hole up in the Host Tower and control the city. Or, at least, they used to. They aren't telling the High Captains anything, now, as far as we can tell.~
@29 = ~NP: Where is the wizards tower located?~ /*Where wizard tower?*/
@30 = ~You don't think they rule the city anymore?~
@31 = ~NP: Take a look around. Many people were recruited into their army, and then they died... Or they were simply killed in the streets. The houses were looted and burned. All ports are closed, gates are locked. We are all trapped in this turmoil.~ /*Look around you. Many people have been drafted into their armies and killed... or just slaughtered in the streets.*/
@32 = ~Hmph. I'm sure the northern lords outside of Luskan are cheering all this on; they won't stop it. The Arcane Brotherhood might, but they haven't done anything.~
@33 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@34 = ~NP: There used to be five of them... All the leaders of the pirates gathered and decided to rule the city together, to the greatest pleasure of the Brotherhood of Mysteries. And now it looks like theyre determined to fight until only one of them is left... Or until Luskan is stone unturned. Now there are only two left, everyone says so... High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurt.~ /*Now it seems they're going to fight until there's only one left standing... or Luskan is in ruins, maybe. Just two are left, now, as far as anybody can tell... High Captain Baram and High Captain Kurth.*/
@35 = ~Tell me about Baram.~
@36 = ~Tell me about Kurth.~
@37 = ~It's on an island to the northwest, by the mouth of the river. There's one bridge across, but nobody can cross it without the Brotherhood's leave... magical wards and all that, I suppose.~
@38 = ~Hard to believe that anyone rules the city anymore. The wizards don't come out... they could be dead, for all we know... and the High Captains have all gone mad.~
@39 = ~NP: Baram is very cunning. I couldnt believe hed last this long... Especially after Kurt burned down his base in the slums. Nobody knows where he went. Although his wererats are everywhere... And everyone says that he has even more monsters and even demons.~ /*Nobody knows where he is now. His wererats are everywhere, though... and everyone says he has more monsters and even demons under his control.*/
@40 = ~NP: He used to be the most powerful High Captain, no wonder he is still alive. Although Baram did manage to burn down his tower. People say he escaped and locked himself in the West Harbor area, and now no one can get in or out. Although I dont know if thats true. The truth is that his people, the Bloody Hands, are brutal killers. If they see you on the street, they will think you are from Barams army. Beware of them.~ /*What is true is that his men, the Bloody Hands, are vicious killers. If they see you on the streets, they'll think you're with Baram. Avoid them.*/
@41 = ~NP: I think the Tesak tavern is still open. Its just past the ford, north of here.~ /*The Cutlass Inn still operates, I think. It's to the left of the main gate, just south of here.*/
@42 = ~NP: Hmmm. I was told that the temple of Tyr was closed, but that may not be true. You need to go to the east... The temple is there.~ /*Hmmm. I had heard the temple of Tyr was sacked, but that may not be true. Go to the far west where the merchants are... the temple is there.*/
@43 = ~Aye. There be a few merchants off in the west part of the district. They be poorly-equipped, though, and until the Mirabar district is opened up they'll stay that way.~
@44 = ~What's this Mirabar district?~
@45 = ~Well, let's see. You have Miss Bela's here, on the island. To the north is the slums. There are still some merchants to the west. Much of the remainder of the city is closed off. Most of the streets are dangerous... so be careful.~
@46 = ~NP: This is a trading district, its on the other side of the river. True, pirates have now captured it ... The entrance from the river is closed, so there is no way for you to get there. The High Captains burned many warehouses there until the pirates went berserk and shut it down. Its impossible to get in there until all this madness stops.~ /*The High Captains burnt a lot of the warehouses down, there, until the pirates got mad and closed it off. Like I said, though, there's no way to go there until all this madness ends.*/
@47 = ~NP: Greetings,<SIRMAAM> ! Did you miss the old Gregor? What can I do for you?~ /*Greetings, to you. I am Mobley, the mayor of Charwood. What can I do for you?*/
@48 = ~Thank you for the assistance. Bloody creatures seem to be everywhere, now. My advice is to stay off the streets like most everyone else.~
@49 = ~NP: What are these beings?~ /*What is this place?*/
