@0    = ~(The child shouts into the darkness of the well.) Papa! Papa! Do you hear me? Papa! Just leave the coin down there and come back! Please! I'm scared!~
@1    = ~(A child is crying. He is sitting alone, face buried in his hands, near the well. He does not even realize that you are standing near him.)~
@2    = ~What has happened, child? I heard you calling to your father. Where is he?~
@3    = ~(Leave him alone.)~
@4    = ~I lost my coin... Mother gave it to me before she died... I accidentally lost it in the well, so Father told me to wait here, and then he went to the mines! I have not seen him for hours... (The boy's tears glisten as they trail down his face.)~
@5    = ~I've heard about strange things that happen in the mines... I want to see my papa! I'm so scared!~
@6    = ~I'll look for your papa, child.~
@7    = ~Your father is probably dead. It should be obvious.~
@8    = ~Thank you... I'll wait here for my papa... He'll come back soon...~
@9    = ~But... no! Papa will come for me! He won't leave me as my mother did!~
@10   = ~(The boy leans over the edge of the well. He starts to shout louder and louder into the darkness. Suddenly his cries turn into screams as he pitches head first into the darkness. The last thing you hear is the sickening crunch of breaking bones.)~
@11   = ~(Now there is only silence from the well.)~
@12   = ~(You leave the crying boy.)~
@13   = ~Did you find my papa?~
@14   = ~I'm sorry, child, but I did not.~
@15   = ~I'm sorry, boy, but your father was killed by the creature inside the mines. All that was left was your coin.  Here, take it as a remembrance of both of your parents.~
@16   = ~No, and I won't waste my time looking for him. It is obvious that he's dead.~
@17   = ~Please, look for him.~
@18   = ~Papa... died because of me...? No... You lie! You lie! (The boy runs away.)~
@19   = ~Uncle Patrick told me everything... I'm sorry I ran away... Uncle treats me well... I think I'll study to become a Dawnmaster, and then I'll be able to help other people. Papa would approve of that.~
@20   = ~I'm sorry, but I have to study now. I have a lot to do, you know.~
@21   = ~It's you again! It's been more than two weeks since uncle Patrick began to teach me and let me live in this place. I still miss my father, but nothing can be done now but move on with my life.  Uncle said that Papa would want me to.~
@22   = ~The Dawnmaster tells me interesting stories from time to time. My favorite is about a plague in a small village. The entire village died because of it, well, except perhaps for two or three people, but then a group of clerics of Lathander arrived and stopped the illness from spreading to other villages. It is sad that they couldn't help the first village, but we mortals can only do so much~
@23   = ~I'm sorry for bothering you. Do you want to see Dawnmaster Patric? He should be upstairs.~
@24   = ~But you are not bothering me, child. Tell me, is Patrick taking good care of you? He didn't say you couldn't tell me how you are, did he?~
@25   = ~Thank you, child. I'll go and talk with him. I want to make sure everything is all right.~
@26   = ~Whatever... Get out of my way.~
@27   = ~Yes, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@28   = ~Everything is all right, but if you wish to speak with him, go then, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. He'll surely welcome you with a smile. If you'd like something from me, I'll be here. Goodbye!~
@29   = ~Of course not! Father Patrick is a very good man. Sometimes, when he's busy, he prefers solitude, and asks me not to disturb him, but still he teaches me, gives me food and shelter, and tells me stories. I need nothing more.~
@30   = ~Sometimes, I visit Miss Irna when she is in Innershade. One day I'll be a Dawnmaster, just like Patrick, or an adventurer, like you!~
@31   = ~Well, you may turn out to be an adventuring Dawnmaster!~
@32   = ~However your life turns out, I'm sure you'll have a good one, whether as a Dawnmaster or as an adventurer. I'm sure either way would be good for you, child.~
@33   = ~Sure thing, child. (Put your hand on his head and smile at him.)~
@34   = ~All right. Now I have to go. See ya!~
@35   = ~Yes! I'll be an adventuring Dawnmaster! I'll fight arm-in-arm with a dwarf and an elf! Of course I'll have to find them first... but I'll surely recognize some when I visit any city!~
@36   = ~I'm glad that I met with you again, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@37   = ~I know! I'll decide one day. I'll also talk about it with Irna! She's so nice to me! When I'm older I'll protect her! I like her smile, but Janny doesn't like it when I talk with her... Oh, you probably don't know Janny. She's my friend.~
@38   = ~I have to say my prayers now. I hope we'll meet again one day!~
@39   = ~(The child looks at you, smiles, and starts to laugh.)~
@40   = ~You have something green in your teeth! It's a bit of lettuce! Hahaha!~
@41   = ~Right! Goodbye, <PRO_SIRMAAM>!~
@42   = ~Oh, it's you. You know, I can cast my first spell! I know how to cure light wounds!~
@43   = ~Go ahead, cast it on me!~
@44   = ~Okay. I hope you'll learn something new soon. I have to go now.~
@45   = ~Whatever. I have to go.~
@46   = ~Okay! Here goes!~
@47   = ~Bye, then!~
