@0 = ~What is it, <GIRLBOY>? Make it snappy. Haven't got all day.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Go on, then. I could stand to gab for a moment or two, aye.~
@5 = ~Maybe you could tell me about some recent events.~
@6 = ~Do you know anything of interest about Blacklake?~
@7 = ~Heh, most o' the rich folk round these parts jus' call me the Cleaning Lady. Weren't always so, of course. Once I had me a pretty name to match me face. The city pays me a bit o' coin to go around the district and keep it tidy, sure enough. I also takes in laundry from me neighbours.~ /*Heh, most o' the rich folk round these parts jus' call me the Cleaning Lady. Weren't always so, of course. Once I had me a pretty name to match me face.*/
@8 = ~So you've been in every house in the area?~
@9 = ~So... what, exactly, do you clean?~
@10 = ~I thought only nobles lived in Blacklake.~
@11 = ~Run off, then, an' leave an old woman to 'er work.~
@12 = ~I might. What events are you referring to?~
@13 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@14 = ~Have you heard anything about strange creatures in the area?~
@15 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@16 = ~I gets around the district a bit, an' hears odd things as an old lady does. What did ye have in mind?~
@17 = ~What kind of odd things do you hear?~
@18 = ~I'm looking for work.~
@19 = ~Are there any places of interest in Blacklake I should visit?~
@20 = ~Not every house, silly <GIRLBOY>, but close enough as it makes no difference.~
@21 = ~Are there certain estates you don't go into?~
@22 = ~I keeps the streets an' such swept around here. An' to get a few extra coppers I takes in laundry from the neighbours, aye. I keep quite a few houses clean too. Not every house, but close enough.~ /*I keeps the streets an' such swept around here. An' to get a few extra coppers I takes in laundry from the neighbours, aye.*/
@23 = ~Oh, I'm sure there's some that'd like everyone to think that, but it weren't true. There's servants an' poor folk alike here in the Blacklake. Don't think we aren't thankful for the ones that live here, none. If it weren't for them, we poor folk'd be the first to feel the touch of the plague, we would.~ /*Don't think we aren't thankful for the ones that live here, none. If it weren't for them, we poor folk'd be the first to feel the touch of the plague, we would.*/
@24 = ~I've got family beyond them walls, <GIRLBOY>, one's that ain't caught the Wailing Death yet. I hears plenty about it. Why?~
@25 = ~Maybe you've heard some rumors around here about the plague? Odd things, perhaps?~
@26 = ~I'm investigating the plague. Maybe you could help me?~
@27 = ~Oh, aye, there's plenty of odd beasts and more besides at the zoo, of course.~
@28 = ~And other than at the zoo, have you heard about any animals?~
@29 = ~Anything you can tell me about the zoo?~
@30 = ~I am listening.~
@31 = ~There was some business with Formosa, but that's all over with. Nothing much happening in the Blacklake now. What else did ye need?~ /*There was some business with Formosa, but that's all over with. Nothing much happening in the Blacklake now.*/
@32 = ~Hee hee... I needs a hand with the laundry scrubbin'. I can spare a copper for ye, <GIRLBOY>. Heh heeee... ah, don't mind me none. What else do you need?~
@33 = ~Not sure what a young <GIRLBOY> like you would like. Maybe go to the Board Laid Bare... 'tis got a strange reputation, they says. Never been there, meself. What else do you need?~
@34 = ~Oh, my! Ye certainly wouldn't catch me going to Meldanen's estate to take 'is laundry, of all things, no no no. Mind you, there was a time... Ahhhh, but I should not talk about such things. I be an old lady, <GIRLBOY>... best you leave me to me work, now.~ /*Oh, my! Ye certainly wouldn't catch me going to Meldanen's estate to take 'is laundry, of all things, no no no. Mind you, there was a time...*/
@35 = ~Oh, go on. What were you about to say?~
@36 = ~Tell me about the wizard, woman, before you try cleaning without hands.~
@37 = ~Could I ask you some other questions?~
@38 = ~Well... there's some folks who think the keepers at the zoo should be killin' all their animals. Somethin' about them coming from Waterdeep or somesuch. Don't know why that would be. The zookeep's talked plenty to the city guard not so long ago... you'd think they'd know their business. What else did ye need?~ /*Well... there's some folks who think the keepers at the zoo should be killin' all their animals. Somethin' about them coming from Waterdeep or somesuch.*/
@39 = ~I don't know anything other than all the babble... but ye could hears that anywhere, I'm sure. What else did ye need?~ /*I don't know anything other than all the babble... but ye could hears that anywhere, I'm sure.*/
@40 = ~Eh... they says that Meldanen the wizard keeps himself a collection o' beasties, but I don't know anything about how recent he got them. You can't talk to him, though. I heard he got put in his place by someone. Nothing happening in the district now. Was there something you needed?~ /*You can't talk to him, though. I heard he got put in his place by someone. Nothing happening in the district now.*/
@41 = ~Why don't ye give it a visit and see for yerself? Them noble types always likes to show off their pretty critters, they does. It be on the north end o' the district. Does ye have more questions?~ /*Why don't ye give it a visit and see for yerself? Them noble types always likes to show off their pretty critters, they does. It be on the north end o' the district.*/
@42 = ~I s'pose not, at that. Formosa's been stirrin' up trouble at the square, they says, trying to turn everyone against the wizard. Bah, best ye hears such things for yerself, I can't make no sense of it. The square's in the southwest part o' the district... and Formosa's there, no doubt. What else did ye need?~ /*Bah, best ye hears such things for yerself, I can't make no sense of it. The square's in the southwest part o' the district... and Formosa's there, no doubt.*/
@43 = ~There was some business with Formosa, but that's all over with. Formosa stirred up trouble at the square, they says, trying to turn everyone against the wizard. Well, someone killed her, they say Meldanen took revenge. What else do you need?~
@44 = ~Aye, if ye wish. I be in no hurry to continue me work.~
@45 = ~Oh, t'was a long time ago, <GIRLBOY>, when I were a pretty lass. Meldanen were a young nobleman, then, an' handsome besides. His father, rest 'is soul, didn't approve of me none, so young Meldanen used t' sneak me into the estate, he did. Hee hee! But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.~ /*But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.*/
@46 = ~If he snuck you into the estate, perhaps that entrance still exists?~
@47 = ~You might know some secrets about Meldanen, then?~
@48 = ~Nay, nay. They say it's best not to talk about the wizard, an' I agree. T'is of no importance, besides.~
@49 = ~Pfeh, threaten an old woman, would ye? T'is nothing but an old story, <GIRLBOY>.~
@50 = ~Eh... they says that Meldanen the wizard keeps himself a collection o' beasties, but I don't know anything about how recent he got them. You wants to talk to 'im, go to his mansion. He don't like visitors, though. Do you need anything else?~ /**/
@51 = ~Oh, aye, that it does. Meldanen had a magic door put into me very own home which leads into his estate. It would open for me at midnight, ye see. I keeps the door closed an' shuttered, now. No idea if it even still opens none... I be hopin' Meldanen's gone an' forgotten about little me.~ /*Oh, aye, that it does. Meldanen had a magic door put into me very own home which leads into his estate. It would open for me at midnight, ye see.*/
@52 = ~Ahhh, it be far too many years gone by, <GIRLBOY>. The wizard's secrets are 'is own, and I be no more privy to them then anyone else here. They say that Meldanen keeps a strange lot o' creatures in his estate, though, and I don't doubt it none. He were always fascinated by such. Even when he were young, he kept strange worms an' a beastie bird that ate bloody meat. But I'll talk no more about that, no.~ /*He were always fascinated by such. Even when he were young, he kept strange worms an' a beastie bird that ate bloody meat. But I'll talk no more about that, no.*/
@53 = ~I were a pretty lass an' Meldanen a handsome nobleman. His father, rest 'is soul, didn't approve of me none, so young Meldanen used t' sneak me into the estate, he did. Hee hee! But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.~
@54 = ~If ye wish to use it some, me home be on the north end o' the district. Here be my key. Take it. Jus' don't make a mess, mind you. I don't really have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard anyway, so I don't think I need to worry about you. Just use the key and go on in.~ /*I don't really have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard anyway, so I don't think I need to worry about you. Just use the key and go on in.*/
@55 = ~I am grateful. Take these ten gold pieces as a gift from me.~
@56 = ~I no longer have the key. You will have to find it if you want to enter there. My home be almost in the very center o' the district. Trust me, I don't have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard, so I don't think there's anything to worry about.~
@57 = ~Thank you, me <LADYLORD>... 'tis a fair amount of coin for a poor old woman to own. Ye're very kind.~
@58 = ~Aye, farewell to ye.~
@59 = ~You just stay right where ye are, <GIRLBOY>, so I can keep an eye on ye.~
