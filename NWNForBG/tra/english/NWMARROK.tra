@0 = ~Well now, you might know your way around a fine weapon or two, eh? What can Marrok do for you?~
@1 = ~What exactly is it you do here?~
@2 = ~I want you to make an item for me.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~I'm a weapon and armor smith, of sorts. I take component items and combine them with magic items to make even more powerful magic items. Not a bad little gig, if you can get it.~
@5 = ~What kinds of things would 'component' items be?~
@6 = ~I'm not interested right now.~
@7 = ~Okay, I see there's some stuff on my anvil. Let me take a look and see what I can construct for you.~
@8 = ~Just place one component item and one magical weapon or one suit of magic armor on the forge and I'll help you out. But if the forge isn't full - like now - I can't really do my thing, can I?~
@9 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time.~
@10 = ~NP: Well, I need adamant, ironwood, diamonds, dragon blood, fairy dust (ugh!!), and also holy water and gargoyle skulls... And... And.. Adamant... Then I'll take a magic item, more one component, and I'll do something new.~ /*Well, I need stuff like Adamantine and Ironwood and Diamonds and Dragon Blood and Fairy Dust (SPIT!!) and Holy Water and Gargoyle Skulls and... and...

@16 = ~NP: Well maybe. for me it is not so important, but I will not be able to sell a thing if you do not know anything about it. Here, take a book. Everything is written there.~ /*Eh, I suppose. I don't like tipping my hand all that much, but I can't sell it if you don't know about it. Here, take a copy of this book. It's got all you need to know.*/
@17 = ~That ain't my concern. If you're the adventuring sort, you can go try and take them from monsters. I think you can get some from merchants, though.~
@18 = ~Eh, no. See, If your weapon or armor is really powerful already, you should keep it. Just give me your low-level magic items. I can't guarantee that your fancy item won't get worse.~
