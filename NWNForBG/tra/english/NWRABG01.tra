@0 = ~You better step back. Mr. Rumbottom does not permit strangers to enter his estate.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~NP: I... I don't often get the chance to talk to people. I used to take care of Mr. Rambottom's horse, but he says he... lost it. Now I am a guard. I'm sorry, I can't concentrate. What did you want?~ /*I... I don't get the chance to speak with people all that often. I'm usually caring for Mr. Rumbottom's horse, but he claims to have... lost it. Now I'm a guard.*/
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~Do you know anything about the Wailing Death?~
@6 = ~Anything interesting going on here in Blacklake?~
@7 = ~Why can't I enter the estate?~
@8 = ~Goodbye, then. Don't mind me.~
@9 = ~NP: Oh, I'm just guarding the door, though I don't know why. It's not really my job. I take care of animals. I am not a fighter. My salary is not worth it. Mr. Rambottom decided his guards were incapable of killing, so he found someone to fix the problem. You should have seen these beasts inside. Terribly ferocious.~ /*Mr. Rumbottom has become concerned that his security is not up to snuff, so he's thrown a bunch of people at the problem. You should see the brutes inside. Vicious lot.*/
@10 = ~NP: I would like to. I don't know what to do - worse than that, I don't know what *not* to do. People seem to understand everything without warning. I'm sure you've heard all this before. Anything else?~ /*I wish I did. I don't know what I'm supposed to do - worse, I don't know what *not* to do. People just seem to get it without warning.*/
@11 = ~NP: Sorry, but I'm completely unfamiliar with this area. I usually take care of horses and try not to go anywhere. Old Worthington in the stable knew a lot about politics and all that, but he died last week. Is there anything else you wanted?~ /*Old Worthington in the stables used to know a lot about politics and such, but he died last week. Anything else you need?*/
@12 = ~I'm looking for work.~
@13 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@14 = ~I don't really care if you go in or not. This isn't my proper job, and I don't feel like losing my life over it. I'm not really much of a fighter.~
@15 = ~I ain't doing any hiring myself, and I don't know anyone who is. I'm just a butler... guard too, I guess. Anything else you need?~
@16 = ~I'm sorry, I do tend to ramble. What is it you wanted?~
@17 = ~The door is already open anyway. You could just walk in. I wouldn't do it, though. It's not safe. There are guards - real ones, not like me.~
@18 = ~Why isn't it safe?~
@19 = ~You really won't do anything if I go in?~
@20 = ~I'm just a stable-hand, really. This seems like pretty dangerous stuff for what I make. Especially since I would expect to lose any fight I started.~
@21 = ~NP: The guards inside are very strong. I don't know why Mr. Rambottom didn't put them outside. Maybe he wanted to surprise the robbers. I don't know. They attack without warning. They are just killers, really. The fact that they work as guards just gives them the opportunity to kill with impunity. I don't like them very much.~ /*They attack on sight. Nothing more than killers, really. Working as a guard just lets them hurt people legally. I don't like them much.*/
@22 = ~I told you, I'm no guard. I don't make enough gold to get in your way. I say it ain't safe, but what you do is your business.~
@23 = ~But who am I to question the oh-so-important merchant nobility. Mr. Rumbottom does as he wishes, though I swear I've never swung a sword in my life.~
@24 = ~Get lost! Only guests of Mr. Rumbottom are allowed in. Please, I'm just doing my job.~
