@0 = ~No! Please! Whatever you're here for, just take it and go! Tell Mistress Ophala that I'm sorry I caused her distress! I'm sorry!~
@1 = ~Relax, I'm not here to hurt you.~
@2 = ~Who said I was here because of Ophala? Who is that?~
@3 = ~Yes, I'm here because of Ophala, just like you said.~
@4 = ~MT: You opened my doors, trampled here, and you must be sick with the plague! You've already harmed me! All because of that damned figurine! Do not pretend to be stupid and do not make eyes, everything is clear to me. Tell her I'm sorry and I won't bother her again! Take that damned figurine and get out!~ /*So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!*/
@5 = ~Your valuables!! Where are they !!! NOW!!!~
@6 = ~Where is this statue she wants? Why is it important?~
@7 = ~I swear she didn't send me here.~
@8 = ~I'm going now.~
@9 = ~MT: Don't lie to me! I know! She has been hunting for this figurine for a long time, and now you, the thief, have appeared in my house! Of course you are from her! Do not pretend to be stupid and do not make eyes, everything is clear to me. Tell her I'm sorry and I won't bother her again! Take that damned figurine and get out!~ /*So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!*/
@10 = ~MT: Well, of course! I wouldn't believe it if you denied it. She has been hunting for this figurine for a long time, and now you have appeared, a robber in my house! Do not pretend to be stupid and do not make eyes, everything is clear to me. Tell her I'm sorry and I won't bother her again! Take that damned figurine and get out!~ /*So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!*/
@11 = ~Everywhere! It's my home! There's a key around here somewhere! It opens everything! JUST DON'T TOUCH ME!!!~
@12 = ~MT: I swear Ofala didn't send me here.~ /*I swear she didn't send me here.*/
@13 = ~MT: If you're not from her, I won't tell you anything. And if from her, she herself would tell you if she saw fit. Suffice it to say that if you invite Madam from Moonstone Mask to the ball, you need to be very careful not to leave with her sister. No amount of art can save your skin from its wrath. Take away. The figurine is in the closet, next to me, there is also the key to most locks.~ /*Suffice it to say that if you take the matron of the Moonstone Mask to a ball, make sure you don't leave with her sister.*/
@14 = ~It doesn't matter. You're either here for the statue or you're a thief and you'll take it anyway. Either way, I don't have to deal with it anymore.~
@15 = ~MT: Take what you want. Just don't touch me. I don't need anyone here, and I don't want Ofala to keep pestering me! There was a key around here somewhere that unlocked almost every lock... Or just break all the doors, I don't care. Just don't touch me!~ /*Take what you want. Just don't hurt me. I don't want anyone here, and I sure don't want Ophala breathing down my neck anymore!*/
@16 = ~What? Who... ? Ruffian! Please, get away!~
