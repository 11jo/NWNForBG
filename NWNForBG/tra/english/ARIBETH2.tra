@0 = ~NP: Nice to see you here in Port Llast, my friend. If we happen to be able to track down this strange cult that spread the plague, it will certainly happen with your help. I don't know what you've already been told about Lord Nasher's orders. But of course I will try to help you as best I can.~ [ARIBE292] /*It is good to see you here in Port Llast, my friend. If we are to have any luck in tracking down this strange cult behind the plague, it will be with your aid I am sure.*/
@1 = ~What exactly are Lord Nasher's orders?~
@2 = ~I am more concerned about how you are holding up.~
@3 = ~What do you think I should do now?~
@4 = ~NP: You know, of course, that this Dester... and Fentik... were both connected to some religious sect that caused the Howling Death to appear in the city. We know so little about this cult... and it would be foolish and reckless to assume that they are already done for just because their activities in Neverwinter have ceased.~ [ARIBE294] /*We know so little about this cult... and it would be foolish in the extreme to suppose that simply because their activities in Neverwinter have been stopped, that they have been defeated.*/
@5 = ~How I feel is... unimportant, <CHARNAME>, next to the mission we have been given. Please, allow me to explain what is required of us.~ [ARIBE472]
@6 = ~NP: Lord Nasher orders us to find the headquarters of this sect, find out what their plans are... and stop them before they do anything more terrible. Aarin Gend, Lord Nasher's chief spy, is here in Port Llast now, and he will help you... all the information about all sorts of strange things happening in the northern lands flocks to him.~ [ARIBE296] /*Aarin Gend, Lord Nasher's spymaster, is here in Port Llast to help us do this... and has brought reports of many strange activities throughout the northern lands.*/
@7 = ~It is possible that agents of the cult may be behind some of these activities. If so, we may be able to find them and discover where their base is located. Your aid in this, <CHARNAME>, will prove invaluable.~ [ARIBE298]
@8 = ~I have some questions about this mission.~
@9 = ~I have located some information about the cult.~
@10 = ~You look tired. Have you not been sleeping well?~
@11 = ~You said I should ask you how you became a paladin.~
@12 = ~You seem angry. Is something wrong?~
@13 = ~Do you have any advice for me?~
@14 = ~NP: Ok, I will go.~ /*Fine, I'll go.*/
@15 = ~Of course. Ask what you will of me, <CHARNAME>.~ [ARIBE299]
@16 = ~What are you and Aarin Gend going to be doing here while I search?~
@17 = ~How do you propose I look for this cult?~
@18 = ~What should I do if I discover something?~
@19 = ~Why are we not searching more in Neverwinter?~
@20 = ~Just what do we know about this cult?~
@21 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@22 = ~NP: I understand everything, I'll go.~ /*All right, I'll be going.*/
@23 = ~NP: What would you like to know?~ [ARIBE312] /*What do you wish to know?*/
@24 = ~This is good news. What have you discovered?~ [ARIBE313]
@25 = ~Show her Ganon's journal.~
@26 = ~Show her the letter to Solomon.~
@27 = ~Show her the letter to Neva.~
@28 = ~Show her Relmar's journal.~
@29 = ~Show her the Charwood cultist's journal.~
@30 = ~Show her the letter to Vardoc.~
@31 = ~Nothing yet.~
@32 = ~NP: So, it was the cult that pissed off the creatures in the hills? Putting an end to this is a real feat. I can say with certainty that your name will not be forgotten, hero. While the information you've been able to obtain is incredibly valuable, we still don't know where the cult is located. This knowledge will be useful to us when we decide to strike at the cult.~ [ARIBE314] /*While this information you bring is incredibly valuable, it still does not tell us where the cult is based. We need that information if we are to strike at them.*/
@33 = ~NP: Luckily, it mentions where some of the other cultists can be found. In Charwood and Neverwinter Forest. Perhaps you should look there for the information we need. Did you manage to find out anything else?~ [ARIBE631] /*Fortunately, it does mention where more cultists may be found. Charwood and the Neverwinter Wood. Search those places, perhaps, for the information we seek.*/
@34 = ~NP: The cult wanted to hit you through their agent, right? Fortunately for us, their actions did not bear fruit. Did you manage to find out anything else?~ [ARIBE633] /*The cult sought to strike against you through an agent, did they? Fortunate for us that their efforts proved fruitless.*/
@35 = ~NP: From what I understand, this Maugrim is starting to get nervous. They're afraid of you... and for good reason. Did you manage to find out anything else?~ [ARIBE634] /*This Maugrim grows desperate, I see. They fear you... and well they should.*/
@36 = ~NP: One can only wonder what the cult in Neverwinter Forest could have done if they had succeeded in realizing their plans. Great job. Based on this information, it can be assumed that this Maugrim and his cult are in Luskan. However, I think it could also be a trap. Perhaps they deliberately rigged this finding of yours to mislead us. We need to find some more proof.~ [ARIBE635] /*This information suggests that this Maugrim and his cult are to be found within Luskan. I do wonder, however, if this is not some attempt on their part to deceive us. Perhaps they meant for you to find this?*/
@37 = ~NP: Okay, I'll return soon.~ /*Thank you. I'll return directly.*/
@38 = ~NP: Hmm. Ravings of a madman. Try to guess what the cult hoped to achieve in this accursed place. Did you manage to find out anything else?~ [ARIBE639] /*Hmm. The ramblings of a madman. One has to wonder what this cult hoped to achieve in that haunted place.*/
@39 = ~NP: So the cult tried to hit you again! And this time they gave themselves away. Great! Based on this information, it can be assumed that this Maugrim and his cult are in Luskan. However, I think it could also be a trap. Perhaps they deliberately rigged this finding of yours to mislead us. We need to find confirmation of this information.~ [ARIBE640] /*This information suggests that this Maugrim and his cult are to be found within Luskan. I do wonder, however, if this is not some attempt on their part to deceive us. Perhaps they meant for you to find this?*/
@40 = ~NP: All right, I'll be back soon.~ /*Thank you. I'll return directly.*/
@41 = ~NP: This information confirms... The cult is located in Luskan. Well done<CHARNAME> . You justify Lord Nasher's trust, and more than that. You must find a way to get into Luskan, and then into the Master's Tower itself. Talk to Aarin... hopefully he'll figure out the best way for you to do this.~ [ARIBE636] /*You will need to get into Luskan and enter the Host Tower, itself. Speak to Aarin... hopefully he will have some ideas on how you can go about this.*/
@42 = ~That sounds like a dangerous task.~
@43 = ~Can I expect some help? Will you be coming with me?~
@44 = ~How will I get into the tower?~
@45 = ~NP: Okay, I'll go to Aarin.~ /*Okay, me go now, yuh?*/
@46 = ~NP: Without a doubt. But you've handled equally dangerous missions, and you've done a great job... and I'm afraid you'll have to face much more terrible things in this case until the threat is completely eliminated. You agreed to help Lord Nasher, didn't you? Whatever the reasons for this, I strongly doubt that you expected the task to be easy.~ [ARIBE317] /*Without a doubt. You have faced tasks of similar danger, however, and excelled... and will no doubt face much worse before this threat is ended.*/
@47 = ~Both Aarin and I will join you in Luskan, of course. Aarin will be there to help you enter the tower, <CHARNAME>. As for me, I have... other plans.~ [ARIBE319]
@48 = ~Speak to Aarin Gend, as I said. With luck, he will have a plan to not only get you into the city but into the tower, itself.~ [ARIBE323]
@49 = ~NP: I'm here to enforce Lord Nasher's orders, and Aarin continues to use his agents to gather information outside of Neverwinter. To be honest, my own role is not very defined. Part of me thinks my Lord Nasher just wants someone here he trusts... and part of me thinks he doesn't want to remember Fentik and my pain. Anyway, we will do our best to help you,<CHARNAME> . Don't think that your efforts go unnoticed.~ [ARIBE300] /*Admittedly, my own role seems sparse. Part of me thinks that my Lord Nasher simply wishes someone he trusts in this role... while another believes he does not wish to be reminded of Fenthick or my pain.*/
@50 = ~NP: Aarin has a few thoughts about where the cultists might be hiding. Now he is trying to find a way to enter the city of Luskan... his gates have been closed since the epidemic began in Neverwinter. I suggest you talk to Aarin about his assumptions. Look for any information about ancient cults or other strange things. When a way to get to Luskan is found, you can look there as well. If we are lucky, you will find one of the cultists and find out who they are and where their base is located.~ [ARIBE303] /*I suggest you talk to Aarin about where these places might be. Search for any clues about the rise of ancient cults or odd activities. Once a way into Luskan is found, you can search there, as well.*/
@51 = ~Any information you discover should be brought to Aarin and myself. Once we know more about the cult, Lord Nasher can decide what to do next.~ [ARIBE306]
@52 = ~NP: The search continues in the city<CHARNAME> . Of course, Lord Nasher ordered to comb Neverwinter for traces of the cult. However, he senses that the cultists' main force is located somewhere outside of Neverwinter... and that it is you, by putting in the effort here, that can bring about results.~ [ARIBE307] /*It is his feeling, however, that the true force of the cult lies outside of Neverwinter... and that it is your efforts here that will prove the most valuable.*/
@53 = ~NP: Their representative in Neverwinter, as you found out, was Dester, but we know very little about the sect itself. Aarin is certain that the core of the sect lies outside of Neverwinter and that it will show us its true power yet. The task before us will certainly be very dangerous... but we absolutely need to find out what kind of sect it is and what its plans are.~ [ARIBE309] /*The task ahead of us will, no doubt, be most dangerous... but that makes it all the more necessary that we do not remain ignorant of what this cult is and what it intends.*/
@54 = ~Why do you ask me that, <CHARNAME>? The spymaster put you up to this, didn't he?~ [ARIBE362]
@55 = ~No, he didn't.~
@56 = ~NP: (Lie) Actually, yes.~ /*Yes, he did, actually.*/
@57 = ~NP: (Lie) No, I didn't.~ /*No, he didn't.*/
@58 = ~Yes, he did, actually.~
@59 = ~NP: It's clear. I think my condition is not a secret to anyone. But Aarin worries in vain ... a few bad dreams are not a reason to worry. The servants say that I talk in my sleep and say something very scary. They treat me so carefully, like I'm crazy, and Aarin pays much more attention to their superstitious chatter than they should. After everything that's happened, after this plague and... and Fentik, I don't think it's surprising to have disturbing dreams, don't you think<CHARNAME> ?~ [ARIBE362] /*The servants claim I speak in my sleep and say frightening things. They creep about me cautiously like I have gone mad, and Aarin pays their superstitious twitterings far more heed than he should.*/
@60 = ~No, it's not surprising at all.~
@61 = ~These dreams are disturbing enough to keep you from sleep?~
@62 = ~Perhaps you've gone mad. Completely cracked.~
@63 = ~NP: Well, finally, at least someone reasonable! I keep telling Aarin that these stupid dreams are nothing to worry about, but he keeps treating me like I'm disabled. These dreams will surely... surely pass with time. We have far more important things to worry about than my sleep.~ [ARIBE366] /*Finally, someone with some sense! I keep telling Aarin that these strange dreams are nothing to be concerned over, but he insists on treating me like an invalid.*/
@64 = ~You don't sound very convinced.~
@65 = ~Now you, too? Has the world gone mad, or is it me? These dreams are... disturbing and frightening, but... they shall pass! They are my burden to bear and no one else's.~ [ARIBE371]
@66 = ~Why don't you tell me about these dreams? Maybe it will help.~
@67 = ~Have you considered that maybe it's more serious than that?~
@68 = ~NP: Dreams are only dreams and the reason is that my grief is too much for me. I don't want to discuss them... especially with you. Let's get back to discussing your task,<CHARNAME> and we won't talk about that anymore.~ [ARIBE369] /*The dreams are simply dreams, no doubt caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear. I will not discuss them... especially not with you.*/
@69 = ~*Sigh* Perhaps you are right, <CHARNAME>. Having the perspective of another on these dreams may not be a bad idea.~ [ARIBE372]
@70 = ~NP: I... I fall in my sleep. I always fall. In total darkness that suffocates and sucks me in. Crooked hands reach out to me, and voices... a cacophony of whispers, begging me to help them. And... and then I see a figure wrapped in a shroud. This is Fentik. He moves away from me, I try to catch up with him, but he always disappears into the darkness. The voices are getting louder. They accuse me, and I... I burn with shame, although I don't know what they blame me for. I call for help, I demand that they stop mocking, but no one hears me.~ [ARIBE373] /*The voices get so much louder. They are accusing me, blaming me, and I... I feel ashamed, though I do not know what I am being blamed for. I cry out for help, for them to stop their assault, but I go unheeded.*/
@71 = ~NP: And then I grab the receding figure... and see that it's not Fentik. He turns and looks at me sadly... and I realize that this is Tyr... and then my god turns his back on me. This... these are my dreams<CHARNAME> . Perhaps you will understand why I do not want to discuss them. I'm... afraid... afraid of what they might mean.~ [ARIBE373] /*And then I catch up to the figure... and I see that it is not Fenthick. He turns and gazes at me with sad eyes... and I know it is Tyr... and then my god turns his back on me.*/
@72 = ~That's understandable. They would frighten me, as well.~
@73 = ~It is only fears and worries dredged up by your mind, Aribeth.~
@74 = ~I don't know what to say about that.~
@75 = ~NP: Everything is fine,<CHARNAME> . There's not much to say here, right? But... I'm glad I told you... now these dreams won't bother me so much. I feel much better now, thank you. Hmm... It reminded me of how I became a paladin. Someday I will tell you this story. Well, until then, let's get back to your task. After all, we at least have something to focus on.~ [ARIBE386] /*It's all right, <CHARNAME>. There isn't much that can be said, is there? But... I am glad I told you. It makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, somehow.*/
@76 = ~NP: Like, have I lost my mind? A few sleepless nights because I had to go through more grief than my heart could bear, and I'm already considered a crazy harpy to be handled with gloves on? I should have understood that this should not be discussed with you. Let's get back to your task, but we won't talk about it anymore.~ [ARIBE389] /*Gone mad, have I? Some restless nights caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear and suddenly I am some raving harpy to be handled with padded gloves?*/
@77 = ~I did say that, didn't I? Are you sure you wish to hear the tale? It is not an exciting one, and I would not wish to bore you, <CHARNAME>.~ [ARIBE392]
@78 = ~No, I want to hear it.~
@79 = ~Maybe some other time, then.~
@80 = ~NP: As you wish. But just don’t complain later if the story disappoints you in the best expectations. After all, I'm not a bard. Where do I begin?~ [ARIBE392] /*As you wish. Do not complain later, however, if you find the tale does not live up to your expectations. I am, after all, no bard.*/
@81 = ~That would probably be best. What can I do for you, then?~ [ARIBE431]
@82 = ~NP: My family lived in a human village, in the wilderness of the northern mountains, and I never imagined that I would become anything more than just a skilled hunter, which was my father. The village was destroyed during the campaign of hordes of orcs to the south. My family died, but I survived. For many years, I only dreamed of somehow getting revenge on the orcs. I roamed the wild rocks with a bow in my hand and ruthlessly killed all the orcs that came across my path.~ [ARIBE394] /*For years, I thought of little but wreaking bloody vengeance upon the orcs. I stalked the crags with my bow, mercilessly killing all I crossed.*/
@83 = ~That doesn't sound like you at all.~
@84 = ~How did you become a paladin after that?~
@85 = ~Okay, getting bored now...~
@86 = ~Indeed, I was much different then. My vengeance consumed me, and I dealt death at every turn... but I had no peace.~ [ARIBE397]
@87 = ~It was not an easy thing. My lust for vengeance consumed me. I was no better than the beasts I hunted, to be truthful.~ [ARIBE428]
@88 = ~Shush, <CHARNAME>. I have barely begun my tale. Control your attention span for a moment.~ [ARIBE429]
@89 = ~NP: In my fifth winter of hunting, I hunted down a tribe of orcs on the Spine of the World. And then such a terrible snowstorm broke out that I could only put up a tent and pray. The storm was relentless and lasted for many days, and I lay in the snow and died when I saw a man approaching me. I thought I was crazy. He was tall and strong, although I noticed that he was missing his right arm. And he didn't seem to feel the cold at all... he looked kindly at me and effortlessly lifted me up from the snow.~ [ARIBE398] /*He was tall and strong, though I noticed he was missing his right hand. The cold did not seem to affect him... and he looked down at me kindly and picked me up from the snow without effort.*/
@90 = ~I remember nothing beyond that. When I awoke, I found myself at a small Ilmateri monastery near the city of Silverymoon. The monks told me I had nearly died.~ [ARIBE401]
@91 = ~Who was the man who saved you?~
@92 = ~The man who saved you... that was Tyr?~
@93 = ~You're right, this is a long story.~
@94 = ~NP: I often thought it was none other than Tyr himself, Lord of Justice. Though it may be presumptuous. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater didn't see him bring me... and I didn't see him again either. Or maybe it would be more correct to say that I never saw him in real life. For many months after that, he came to me in a dream and told me that my revenge did not carry true justice. At first, I rejected him, intending to return to my bloody hunt. Dreams began to dream more often, and the person was more and more harsh with me. He told me that the way lay somewhere else, and in the end I left the mountains, came to Neverwinter and began to serve Tyr. The dreams never returned.~ [ARIBE402] /*Peering into an ice crystal that that thrust itself up from Cania's glacial floor, you saw a vision of Mephistopheles' progress in the Prime Material Plane. It appears that, together with his newly created army, he is slowly winding his way to the surface, sowing destruction in his wake. Mephistopheles seems to feed off the ruin he is causing. With every moment, he grows stronger...*/
@95 = ~What happened then?~
@96 = ~You became a cleric, then, like Fenthick?~
@97 = ~So you think Tyr, himself, commanded you to worship him?~
@98 = ~NP: I often thought of him that way. The Embodiment of the Crippled God himself. Although it may be presumptuous on my part. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater didn't see him bring me... and I didn't see him again either. Or maybe it would be more correct to say that I never saw him in real life. For many months after that, he came to me in a dream and told me that my revenge did not carry true justice. At first, I rejected him, intending to return to my bloody hunt. Dreams began to dream more often, and the person was more and more harsh with me. He told me that the way lay somewhere else, and in the end I left the mountains, came to Neverwinter and began to serve Tyr. The dreams never returned.~ [ARIBE402] /*Valen escaped the loneliness of his blood at last, finding in you that other part of his soul that he had always missed. Though the two of you were not always together, you were also never truly apart, and more often than not you were inseperable during the greatest of your adventures. Even when the two of you returned to the planes, he claimed he no longer felt the call of the Blood War within his veins. His heart, he told you, was full enough with you alone...*/
@99 = ~(sigh) You did ask to hear this, <CHARNAME>. Do you want me to stop?~ [ARIBE426]
@100 = ~NP: No, I was just joking.~ /*No, I'm only joking.*/
@101 = ~Yes, maybe I'll hear this later.~
@102 = ~NP: Very funny. Only, I guess I'm just not in a frivolous mood. Let me return to the story of the man who saved me. I often thought it was none other than Tyr himself, Lord of Justice. Though it may be presumptuous. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater didn't see him bring me... and I didn't see him again either. Or maybe it would be more correct to say that I never saw him in real life. For many months after that, he came to me in a dream and told me that my revenge did not carry true justice. At first, I rejected him, intending to return to my bloody hunt. Dreams began to dream more often, and the person was more and more harsh with me. He told me that the way lay somewhere else, and in the end I left the mountains, came to Neverwinter and began to serve Tyr. The dreams never returned.~ [ARIBE427] /*This note is disjointed and sloppy, as though the author wrote it after suddenly waking from a deep sleep.
Excerpt:
I have gained much since the Academy was attacked. I did not see who freed me, and I don't care. Strength has come to me strangely... quickly. There is definitely some greater power at work in Neverwinter, and it favors me this day. I have seen it in the dreams... I see the eye... I don't know what it means, but I know this: if the Neverwintans want me for their cure they can carve the contribution from my corpse! So sayeth Gulnan!*/
@103 = ~NP: The priests of Tyr accepted me, and in time I understood them and admired the Crippled God more and more. I decided to defend justice and become a paladin of Tyr, and I found peace for a long time. My dedication to the cause allowed me to quickly rise in rank, and then, later, I met a young acolyte, Fentik, and realized that I ... found ... finally found my true path ...~ [ARIBE407] /*My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last...*/
@104 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to sadden you.~
@105 = ~You're not going to cry again, are you?~
@106 = ~NP: Finally this story is over. Let's talk about something else.~ /*Okay, story over. Let's talk about something else.*/
@107 = ~NP: No, I... Thank you.<CHARNAME> . Thank you for listening to my story. I feel very good with you. I'd like to call you... friend. Only Tyr knows how hard it is to find a true friend in these dark times. I hope you feel the same way about me.~ [ARIBE409] /*I would be glad to call you a... a friend, <CHARNAME>. Tyr only knows that finding a friend in times like these is difficult enough. I hope you feel the same.*/
@108 = ~Yep.~
@109 = ~I don't need another friend.~
@110 = ~NP: Wow... Slow down, lady! Does that mean we're going to bed soon?~ /*Does this mean we can go to bed soon?*/
@111 = ~I am glad, my friend. Let us return to the subject of your mission, then.~ [ARIBE412]
@112 = ~I... I see. That is too bad, then, for a true friend is a grand thing to have. Let us return to the topic of your mission, then.~ [ARIBE413]
@113 = ~NP: ...I'll forget you said that, sir. And we'll both forget what I said. Let's get back to discussing your task.~ [ARIBE415] /*... I shall forget you said that, sir. Perhaps we should forget that I said anything, either.*/
@114 = ~NP: No, not right away. I hadn't met Fentik then. The priests of Tyr accepted me, and in time I understood them and admired the Crippled God more and more. I decided to defend justice and become a paladin of Tyr, and I found peace for a long time. My dedication to the cause allowed me to quickly rise in rank, and then, later, I met a young acolyte, Fentik, and realized that I ... found ... finally found my true path ...~ [ARIBE423] /*My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last...*/
@115 = ~NP: I don't know. At first, I didn't even worship him. I was tired of these dreams and didn't want to stop hunting orcs. The priests of Tyr accepted me, and in time I understood them and admired the Crippled God more and more. I decided to defend justice and become a paladin of Tyr, and I found peace for a long time. My dedication to the cause allowed me to quickly rise in rank, and then, later, I met a young acolyte, Fentik, and realized that I ... found ... finally found my true path ...~ [ARIBE424] /*My dedication saw me rise through the ranks, and it was much later that I encountered the young acolyte, Fenthick, and knew that I... had found... my true path at last...*/
@116 = ~NP: No. No... I won't cry anymore. Thank you for listening to my story. I feel very good with you. I'd like to call you... friend. Only Tyr knows how hard it is to find a true friend in these dark times. I hope you feel the same way about me.~ [ARIBE409] /*I would be glad to call you a... a friend, <CHARNAME>. Tyr only knows that finding a friend in times like these is difficult enough. I hope you feel the same.*/
@117 = ~Let us talk of something else.~ [ARIBE422]
@118 = ~NP: Yes, I'm angry. I think more and more about how Fentik ended his days... and how I could not do anything to prevent it... and more and more anger in me! Fentik devoted his whole life to the service of justice and the fulfillment of his duty, just like me. And what did he get for it? He was rejected. Rejected by his lord for the needs of a stupid crowd, rejected by his god for a single stupid mistake. Tell me why I shouldn't be angry<CHARNAME> !~ [ARIBE432] /*Discarded. Discarded by his liege lord to appease the witless masses, discarded by his god for one foolish mistake. Tell me why I shouldn't be angry, <CHARNAME>!*/
@119 = ~But Fenthick was involved in the deaths of thousands of people!~
@120 = ~Perhaps it's Fenthick you should be angry at.~
@121 = ~NP: Maybe you're right. You have reason to be angry.~ /*Perhaps you are right... so long as the reward is.*/
@122 = ~I don't like hearing you talk like this.~
@123 = ~You make him sound like a murderer! It was not Fenthick who created the plague, nor Fenthick that betrayed the city! He was merely too trusting and too devoted to duty!~ [ARIBE434]
@124 = ~Aye. Fenthick deserves plenty of my ire, as well. The stupid, stupid fool! If only he had been less trusting, less devoted, he never would have ended as he did!~ [ARIBE458]
@125 = ~Aye. I should be angry at those who condemned Fenthick for the wrong reasons. I should be angry at Fenthick, too, for being a good man and a trusting fool!~ [ARIBE460]
@126 = ~And why shouldn't I talk like this? If Fenthick had questioned more and been less trusting, less devoted, perhaps he would be alive today!~ [ARIBE461]
@127 = ~NP: And so Fentik received his reward. Thank you, Tyr, Lord of Justice, for helping your faithful servant! And what, I'll be next? Will I also end my life as a traitor and be executed for being too zealous in exterminating injustice where I see it? Will Tyr leave me too?~ [ARIBE436] /*Shall I, too, end my life a traitor, executed for being too adhered to my duty to question an injustice when I see it? Will Tyr abandon me then, too?*/
@128 = ~You sound as if you're losing your faith.~
@129 = ~Don't talk like that! Stop it, this isn't like you!~
@130 = ~NP: Finally, I think you have seen the light!~ /*Finally I think you're seeing the light!*/
@131 = ~I... I don't know, <CHARNAME>. Tyr brought me here, put me on this path. I want to know why. Why teach me true justice and then throw it in my face?~ [ARIBE438]
@132 = ~And what *is* like me, <CHARNAME>? Tyr brought me to this place and put me on this path and taught me the meaning of justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!~ [ARIBE456]
@133 = ~I have had no revelation... only questions upon questions. Tyr put me on this path, taught me true justice... only to throw it in my face. I want to know why!~ [ARIBE456]
@134 = ~NP: All I know is that... I'm tired of grieving. I'm tired of being helpless. I feel guilty about these doubts... but I also feel like I should doubt. Revenge is not Tyr's way, but I... I'm afraid I can't wait for justice here. There was no justice for Fentik, only revenge... and there won't be any for me. Maybe it's all... dreams. They don't stop and get worse every night<CHARNAME> . I hear screaming voices, so many voices...~ [ARIBE439] /*All I know is that... I am tired of being sad. I am tired of feeling helpless. I feel guilty for questioning myself... but I feel I must be questioned.*/
@135 = ~The dreams have gotten worse?~
@136 = ~This is bad. Perhaps we should return to Neverwinter.~
@137 = ~I think you really may be going mad!~
@138 = ~Aye. I see Fenthick killed before me, over and over. I hear laughter, and so many crying out to me for help. I almost cannot bear it.~ [ARIBE442]
@139 = ~No. No, there is nothing for me there. And doing so would only hinder your mission... and I will not do that.~ [ARIBE452]
@140 = ~Perhaps I am, at that. I can think of only one thing that would soothe my thoughts.~ [ARIBE452]
@141 = ~Promise me, <CHARNAME>... promise me as my dearest friend that you will find this cult and visit upon them the vengeance that I cannot!~ [ARIBE443]
@142 = ~I promise.~
@143 = ~I can't promise that, Aribeth.~
@144 = ~I don't think that will help you.~
@145 = ~You are mad!~
@146 = ~Thank you, my friend. It... it is all I can think of to silence the dreams. I must do something, and to have you help me brings me great relief.~ [ARIBE444]
@147 = ~I see. It is all I can think of that will silence the dreams. Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps all I need is some rest to put this into proper perspective.~ [ARIBE451]
@148 = ~NP: And I considered you a friend. I see no one can understand what I've been through... okay, so be it. Then leave me<CHARNAME> , and return to your task. We will no longer discuss my feelings.~ [ARIBE454] /*Leave me be, then, <CHARNAME>, and return to your mission. We need discuss my feelings no further.*/
@149 = ~NP: You were a good friend to me<CHARNAME> . Here... take this. This is the ring that belonged to my father. I want you to take it. Let this be a symbol of our friendship. Maybe if... something happens to me... it will remind you of me...~ [ARIBE445] /*You have been a fine friend, <CHARNAME>. Here... take this. It is a ring that belonged to my father. I want you to have it.*/
@150 = ~What do you mean?~
@151 = ~Very well, I will take it.~
@152 = ~No, I don't want it.~
@153 = ~I don't mean anything, my friend. It is... simply fatigue and worry that make me speak such. Please... take the ring.~ [ARIBE447]
@154 = ~NP: It makes me happy. You will do me the honor of wearing it. Let's talk later. go,<CHARNAME> ... find the heart of this cult and return to me. I wish you good luck with all my heart.~ [ARIBE448] /*Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.*/
@155 = ~NP: Then throw it away if our friendship means nothing to you. Although I still hope it's not. Let's talk later. go,<CHARNAME> ... find the heart of this cult and return to me. I wish you good luck with all my heart.~ [ARIBE450] /*Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.*/
@156 = ~NP: According to your information, the base of the cultists is located in the Master's Tower, in Luskan. You must find a way to get into Luskan, and then into the tower itself. Aarin will surely be able to help you with this. And then we'll both meet you in town to help if needed.~ [ARIBE462] /*Your information tells us that the cult likely lies within the Host Tower in Luskan. You need to find a way to gain entrance into Luskan and into the tower, itself.*/
@157 = ~NP: I wish we could offer better leads,<CHARNAME> ...but we don't have anything better than Aarin's information. I can only suggest visiting the locals that Aarin spoke of and keeping a close eye on anything that strikes you as out of the ordinary. Of course, not everything unusual will be related to this cult... but they are around and active, so there is always a chance that you will find them if you are on your guard.~ [ARIBE464] /*Not everything that is unusual will be the doing of this cult, obviously... but they are out there, and active, so there is always a good chance you will discover them if you are alert.*/
@158 = ~I would suggest you speak to Aarin Gend and find out where to focus your efforts in finding evidence of the cult.~ [ARIBE467]
@159 = ~NP: It is vital that you complete Lord Nasher's assignment,<CHARNAME> . Much depends on what else Dester's allies are planning. Have you learned anything new about this cult?~ [ARIBE474] /*It is of vital importance that you complete Lord Nasher's mission, <CHARNAME>. Much depends on you discovering what else Desther's allies have planned.*/
@160 = ~I'm going now.~
@161 = ~NP: I'm glad to see you safe and sound, my friend. Lord Nasher says he is confident in your success, and I am very worried because you are putting yourself in terrible danger. Have you learned anything new about this cult?~ [ARIBE475] /*I am pleased to see that you remain safe, my friend. Lord Nasher tells me he is confident of your success, though I do worry at the danger in which you place yourself.*/
@162 = ~NP: I'm glad to see you again<CHARNAME> . Every time I feel like you've taken on too much of a burden on your shoulders, you amaze me by how brilliantly you handle every challenge time and time again. Have you learned anything new about this cult?~ [ARIBE476] /*It is good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. At times I worry that you have taken on too much responsibility yourself, yet always you surprise me with your resourcefulness and success.*/
@163 = ~NP: Sorry, I can't discuss Neverwinter business with you. Let it come to me<CHARNAME> I will only talk to him.~ /*Now you make fun of me. So be it, <CHARNAME>, I shall speak plainly.*/
