@1 = ~NP: Who are you? No, you don't have to answer, I don't really care. Nobody called you to my kitchen, and even the door was closed! Leave, or I will call the guards, and if they do not arrive in time, I will deal with you! Out!~
@2 = ~NP: Shoo!~
@3 = ~NP: Would you like a kick? Get out!~
@4 = ~NP: I'd give you a couple of cooking lessons, but vagrants like you don't stay in one place for long.~
@5 = ~NP: You're not welcome here!~
