@0 = ~Greetings. Why are you in my home? Not that you shouldn't be here, or anything. I don't really have a reason for you not to be here. And there's no reason you shouldn't go where you want. Really. I didn't mean to cause a fuss. My name is Telma... if you want to know.~ /*And there's no reason you shouldn't go where you want. Really. I didn't mean to cause a fuss. My name is Telma... if you want to know.*/
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose... Is there a reason you are here? Again, I don't really mean to object, but if there's nothing here for you...~
@4 = ~Do you know of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Oh. All right then. Uh... please close the door behind you... ?~
@7 = ~No! I mean, of course not. Why would I know of anything odd? I mean, there's the plague, of course. What else needs to be happening besides that?~
@8 = ~You seem agitated. Is there something hidden here?~
@9 = ~You seem agitated. Are you all right?~
@10 = ~It kills people no matter where they go or what they do. Maybe the nobles can do something, but I'm just a servant.~
@11 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@12 = ~I... well I didn't mean to give the impression that... Oh, hell with it. It looks like you know already. There's something under my house. See, we were digging a... uh... storage place behind the bookcase and down... well, to hide things from the city guards. It didn't pan out, though.~ /*See, we were digging a... uh... storage place behind the bookcase and down... well, to hide things from the city guards. It didn't pan out, though.*/
@13 = ~Oh, I'm fine, of course. Nothing wrong with me. Nothing is out of sorts here. Nothing at all.~
@14 = ~If there is something odd here, you should tell me.~
@15 = ~Come now, fair lass, are you keeping secrets from me?~
@16 = ~Something's wrong here. What is it?! Tell me or die!~
@17 = ~Well, I was serving Lord Fontelbottom at his weekly Gelder's Club meeting, run by old Jim Gelder, you know, and he said something. He said "cure creatures were lost to an attack." Sounds like gibberish to me. He hasn't been the same since... well... he's never been "all there."~ /*He said "cure creatures were lost to an attack." Sounds like gibberish to me. He hasn't been the same since... well... he's never been "all there."*/
@18 = ~There's... something not right down there. There's a door we could never open and... *sounds* that come from behind it. Look at the bookcase and say the word "Halueth." You'll see for yourself.~
@19 = ~What kind of sounds?~
@20 = ~I'm going to go look, all right?~
@21 = ~I'm going to go look. Stay out of my way.~
@22 = ~You'll maybe do something about it? I won't have to worry about it no more? I guess I can talk. See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.~ /*See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.*/
@23 = ~Oh no, I'm staying right out of it. I don't know what's going on, and I don't want to.~
@24 = ~You've got some gall, flirting after inviting yourself into my house. Quite the charmer. I suppose I can tell you, if it'll get rid of you. See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.~ /*See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel.*/
@25 = ~I don't know, and I won't try to find out! Maybe you want to, but I'm not going to go looking for ways to be stupid.~
@26 = ~That's your decision, I guess. The entrance is hidden behind the bookcase. Please, just try not to stir anything up. I have to live here.~
@27 = ~All right, all right, the entrance is hidden behind the bookcase. Please, please don't stir up trouble. I have to live here.~
@28 = ~You again? What do you need?~
@29 = ~Please... I've already told all I can... I just want people to leave my home. Just leave me... It's no secret anymore.~
@30 = ~Go over this secret again for me.~
@31 = ~Tell me about what is going on here! Say or die!~
@32 = ~See, we found a note in an old book, and when we said a certain word, the bookcase moved. We were going to dig out behind it to make a secret place that guards wouldn't look, but we found... well, there was a tunnel. There's... something not right down there.

@33 = ~Why would you want to hurt me? I'll tell, of course... but why threaten?! It's just a word... just a strange little word. You say it and the bookcase opens. "Halueth" is the word. I don't even know what it means. It's just... we used to hide things in the passage. We don't go too far, though. It's eerie... and smells... wrong. It's an old place... we dug out the basement and found it... now I wish we never had. There's something... behind the door.~
@34 = ~Are you telling me everything?!~
@35 = ~I don't know, I don't know! Please! Just get out! Just get out!~
@36 = ~Don't know why you're in my home now. Whatever was in my basement is done and gone. Maybe things will get back to normal now.~
