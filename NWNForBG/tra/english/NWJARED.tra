@0 = ~By the Black Sun, how could she fell me?! The snake gods are pitiful! Beneath the notice of mighty Cyric!~
@1 = ~Relax, I will help, but I have some questions.~
@2 = ~Shut up or I'll leave you here.~ /*Shut up or me leave you.*/
@3 = ~Questions? Oh, certainly. After all, what else am I doing? Just languishing here while my flock are taken to the altar of a worm! A scaled worm!~
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~Scaled Worm? What do you mean?~
@6 = ~How did you end up in here?~
@7 = ~Oh, certainly! Bully the man in the cage. How sporting! As bold as the scaled worm that seduced my flock, and now takes their lives! The indignity!~
@8 = ~Who am I? I am a follower of the great god Cyric! I am a servant of the coming Day of the Dark Sun! I am his will! I am Jared, and I am also caged like so many worthless enemies of the Prince of Lies that I have put to their end! My flock... my flock are usurped, but I shall not bow! I shall not bend! Cyric shall see to my freedom!~ /*I am Jared, and I am also caged like so many worthless enemies of the Prince of Lies that I have put to their end!*/
@9 = ~I am leaving. What should I do about you, hmm?~
@10 = ~Treacherous snake-woman! It calls itself Gulnan! I call it usurper! Cyric, why was she able to defeat me?! I follow the Word!~
@11 = ~What do you think this Gulnan is?~
@12 = ~Where is she?~
@13 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@14 = ~I was usurped, if you must know! She corrupted the weakest of my flock, and now the rest follow or join her legions of undead! I am to be gutted upon her altar! ME! It's not right! Jared of Cyric does the gutting! Not some scaled worm!~ /*I was usurped, if you must know! She corrupted the weakest of my flock, and now the rest follow or join her legions of undead!*/
@15 = ~You would defeat her if released? She already beat you.~
@16 = ~What god does she sacrifice to?~
@17 = ~Well, imbecile, you should fear the will of Cyric and appease him! Release his loyal servant so my dark work in his name continues! Really, you should let me out. Such an action will speak well of you, and guarantee a swift, merciful death when my Lord rules all.~ /*Really, you should let me out. Such an action will speak well of you, and guarantee a swift, merciful death when my Lord rules all.*/
@18 = ~Oh, what the hell. I'll see what I can do.~
@19 = ~You're a potential threat, so you can rot here.~
@20 = ~Foul minion of darkness, you'll stay imprisoned here.~
@21 = ~I suppose you mean physically? Yuan-Ti. Snake-beast wench. Dead, if I get my hands on her! I'll make boots from her flanks!~
@22 = ~In the crypts. She's using the undead... an army of corpses. I would be impressed IF IT WAS ME DOING IT!~
@23 = ~I WASN'T READY! She was sneaky! She was supposed to be weak! She's a scaled worm, damn it! Where did she get such power?!~
@24 = ~What indeed! Not the god of her pathetic people, whatever name such a whelp goes by. Cyric would not have allowed that defeat! She cheats! She's got some power on her side! One that dares ignore my true calling! One that abuses the focus I created!~ /*She cheats! She's got some power on her side! One that dares ignore my true calling! One that abuses the focus I created!*/
@25 = ~Focus? What do you mean?~
@26 = ~Yes! I shall rebuild the grand and glorious cabal of Cyric I had so long planned to unleash upon the city in its weakest moments... er...~
@27 = ~A wise move... IF IT WAS ME MAKING IT! Let me out of here! Cyric let me loose that I might... I might...~
@28 = ~What?! Pawn of order! You will all feel the wrath of Cyric in the end times! I will not be caged! Er... not for long, anyway! Please? Come on!~ /*What?! Pawn of order! You will all feel the wrath of Cyric in the end times! I will not be caged! Er... not for long, anyway!*/
@29 = ~Grrr... if you dared beg this knowledge at any other time I would skin you alive. It is not for outsiders to know... but... I will not allow her to keep it... even if that means some pawn like you taking it from her. It is a tool, a darkly magic stone. It makes the flesh of the dead... useful... for things. Take it from her! It is mine by right! It is pledged to Cyric, not her false lord, whatever it is.~ /*It makes the flesh of the dead... useful... for things. Take it from her! It is mine by right! It is pledged to Cyric, not her false lord, whatever it is.*/
@30 = ~Tormentors! More of you walk free as I languish! Cyric, free me! The scaled worm Gulnan will not have my temple! She will not!~
@31 = ~Free! The will of Cyric shall descend upon this weakened city like... like... like some suitable metaphor I'll think of later! Oh yes, fear my coming retort! Uh... goodbye!~
@32 = ~I see her influence fading... Muuaahaha! She's gone! Gulnan of the pathetic little scaled worms is gone! Praise the Prince of Lies! I shall build anew for Cyric! I will... I will use her beguiling techniques... yessss. Now... if someone would just LET ME THE HELL OUT!~ /*I see her influence fading... Muuaahaha! She's gone! Gulnan of the pathetic little scaled worms is gone! Praise the Prince of Lies!*/
@33 = ~You may leave.~
