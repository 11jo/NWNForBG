@0 = ~Do I know you?~
@1 = ~Me no think so.~
@2 = ~I spoke with you before.~
@3 = ~Maybe you spoke with someone else?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Oh. I can't tell anymore. My mind... it's just a blank these days... years?~
@6 = ~Did you? I don't know anymore. Could have been you, could have been no one, could have been a hundred. I don't know.~
@7 = ~I don't know anymore. You could be the tenth person I've seen, you could be the first. I just don't know anymore.~
@8 = ~I'd leave if I were you. I'd leave if I could.~
@9 = ~I wait for something to happen, and even when it does, it never lasts. I wait, and I watch the castle. Nothing.~
@10 = ~What are you waiting for?~
@11 = ~NP: What is with this village? You are all very strange.~ /*What is wrong with this town? You're all strange.*/
@12 = ~NP: End. I remember the beginning, but we'll never get to the end, and I think we all deserve it. Except Quint. I don't blame him. He was the only one who fought, and he alone had no reason to. Strange, right?~ /*An end. I remember the beginning, but we never got the end, and I suppose we got what we deserved. Except for Quint.*/
@13 = ~Who is Quint?~
@14 = ~What happened to all of you?~
@15 = ~I have to go into the castle now.~
@16 = ~NP: I'm leaving~ /*I'm going now.*/
@17 = ~NP: Yes, that's right, isn't it? We saw how it began, but it did not end, and we got what we deserved. Everyone except Quint. I don't blame him. He was the only one who fought, and he alone had no reason to. Strange, right?~ /*Yes, we are, aren't we? We watched it all start, and when it didn't end, I suppose we got what we deserved. All but Quint.*/
@18 = ~NP: Oh, you will find out everything there. It happened there. I can not tell. I know it's crazy in my head. I know there's nothing left... of any of us... The castle, that's where it all happened. There it was. Death came to everyone and decided to stay...~ /*Oh, you'll find out in there. That's where it happened. I can't say. I know my mind is gone. I know there's nothing left... of any of us...*/
@19 = ~NP: Yes, this is the only way. I want to leave but it doesn't make sense. I know I'm insane. I know there's nothing left... of any of us. The castle, that's where it all happened. There it was. Death came to everyone and decided to stay...~ /*Yes, that's the only way. I'd go, but it wouldn't matter. My mind is gone. I know there's nothing left of any of us.*/
