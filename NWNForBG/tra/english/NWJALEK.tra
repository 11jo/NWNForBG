@0 = ~Well, more nosey little people in my business. You want to try your luck? Drink for drink? Earn my respect?!~ [NWJALE51]
@1 = ~I'll match you drink for drink, no problem!~
@2 = ~I'm just looking for information. I'll gladly pay.~
@3 = ~I'll pass. I'm not looking for trouble.~
@4 = ~All right then! Let's start off with a little Neverwintan Sailor Spirit. A bathtub special here at the Seedy Tavern. Go!~
@5 = ~Bottoms up!~
@6 = ~NP: Uh, I think I'm gonna have to pass.~ /*Ehh, I've changed my mind.*/
@7 = ~You bet you will, but deep pockets don't get you much here. We respect strength. Can you go drink for drink or not?!~
@8 = ~I thought so. All bluff and no stuff. Come back when you've got a spine.~
@9 = ~Ah, that's pretty good. You're not so flimsy after all. How about some Dockside Dunn's, a rank bit of swill if I ever had some!~
@10 = ~Bring it on!~
@11 = ~NP: Ha! Fall off after the first one! What kind of <MALEFEMALE> are you? Ridiculous. I'm wasting my time with you. That's what I thought. Go take a walk, dumbass. You don't belong here, go drink from the china cups.~ /*I thought as much. Take a walk, fool. I'm sure there's some porcelain for you to kiss around here somewhere.*/
@12 = ~Whoa! All right! That's not too bad. Round three then! Orc Blood Brew, and no plugging your nose!~
@13 = ~This easy. Let's go!~
@14 = ~NP: Uh, you should have sat down while you had the chance. I think you're about to hit the floor, from what I can see. That's what I thought. Go take a walk, dumbass. You don't belong here. Go drink out of china cups.~ /*Eh, should'a sat down when you had the chance. You just aren't up to snuff, as far as I'm concerned.*/
@15 = ~All right, but now it gets tough! How about... a little Dwarven Red Eye! It'll make you feel like you're under a pile of stone!~
@16 = ~Cheers!~
@17 = ~NP: Look at that! I did it! Maybe you're all right. I don't care who you are, but if you can drink like that, you're my friend. Now, how about, uh. о... Thai Fire Juice? It'll burn you from the inside out! You got enough crazy in your head to go on?!~ /*Now, how about some... oh... Thayvian Fire Juice? Burns in ways you don't want to know! Are you crazy enough to play?!*/
@18 = ~That right! You and me, drink it back!~
@19 = ~Well I'll be a... How about that?! So... you want to keep going with some... Catoblepas Death Cheese Wine?! Or have you had enough?~
@20 = ~I am just fine! Swig it back!~
@21 = ~NP: Yes, you needed to sit down. And yet, you managed to prove your power to me. Anything you've had since the Red-Eyed Dwarf was just to see how crazy you are. Hey, you need to talk to my friend Kristoff. Show him how to relax. He's too serious.~ /*Well, I guess you should have sat down. Still, you've proven yourself to me. Everything after Dwarven Red Eye was just to see how crazy you are.*/
@22 = ~NP: Yeah, I think you've proven your strength. I mean, after "Red-Eyed Dwarf," they only drank to see how crazy you were. Hey, you need to talk to my friend Kristoff. Show him how to relax. He's too serious. And, uh, to tell you the truth, I don't really feel like trying the next drink. Eh. This stuff is scary to hold.~ /*Yeah, I think you've proven yourself to me. I mean, everything after the Dwarven Red Eye was just to see how crazy you are.*/
@23 = ~Well... looks like we're getting... serious. All right then, from the bowels of the earth, a downright poisonous brew... Dark Elven T'Keela.~
@24 = ~You're not stopping are you? Swig it!~
@25 = ~Thanks. Maybe I'll just sit down for a bit, now.~
@26 = ~And, uh, to tell you the truth, I wasn't looking forward to some of what was coming next. Ugh. Nobody should touch any of that stuff.~
@27 = ~Okay... Not that I'm queasy... but do you want to quit... or try a... a Screaming Harpy! You can't imagine... the horror...~
@28 = ~NP: О! They're diluting! One more!~ /*Bah! Nothing but water! Tip it back!*/
@29 = ~Oh hell... okay... you want to play games... *hic*... okay... The meanest... the foulest... black bile of the earth... A bottle... of Scurrd.~
@30 = ~Through the lips and over the gums!~
@31 = ~What is in Scurrd?~
@32 = ~Son of a...~
@33 = ~Heh... I knew you couldn't... uh...~
@34 = ~NP: What's the big deal about Skurrd? Really, what. "Skurrd... just acts on what... what it can do the most harm to. It's the most insidious stuff. It's not to be sniffed by old people... not to be handled by children. It's Skurrd, and woe betide anyone who dares to taste it.~ /*What is in Scurrd? What, indeed. Scurrd... just seems to find its way... to where it can do the most harm. It's truly vicious.*/
@35 = ~Who are you, fool? Don't you know not to go bothering a Bloodsailor while he's drinking?~ [NWJALE53]
@36 = ~Hmm... do I know you? You wear the uniform, but I don't recognize your face. How long you been a Bloodsailor, <PRO_GIRLBOY>?~ [NWJALE52]
@37 = ~NP: [False] Recently. I was able to replace the plague victim.~ /*Not long. I replaced a plague victim.*/
@38 = ~I'm just looking for information. That's all.~
@39 = ~I'm no Bloodsailor. I'm acting as a city guard.~
@40 = ~NP: Well, okay, well, I guess you're not a bad person. if you have the strength, that's what I'm wondering. You want to have a drinking contest? You can earn my respect!~ /*All right then, I suppose you are okay... but do you have what it takes, I wonder?*/
@41 = ~NP: No, I don't think so. I think I'm looking at a hustler who just wants to join us. You think you're up to our standards?! You want a drinking contest? You can earn my respect!~ /*No, I don't think so. I think you're just some thug who hopes to join up. Are you up to our standards?!*/
@42 = ~So should you be in that uniform or not? I don't think you're up to our standards, not unless you match me drink for drink! Up for it?~
@43 = ~You are in the wrong neighborhood. City officials ain't popular with us. Unless you prove your worth drink for drink! Up for it?~
@44 = ~Damnedest thing I ever saw. You are okay with me and Christov. You bet.~ [NWJALE54]
@45 = ~I had some questions.~
@46 = ~NP: Thank you for your such an important endorsement.~ /*Thanks for your oh so important approval.*/
@47 = ~Goodbye.~
@48 = ~I don't bother worrying about much, friend, but I'll answer if I can.~
@49 = ~Why are you here? What do you do?~
@50 = ~What's going on here?~
@51 = ~Who is Christov?~
@52 = ~Nobody said it would come easy.~
@53 = ~Good luck.~
@54 = ~I'm just a Bloodsailor, friend. I take care of a little business now and then, and I watch over new charges on occasion. Like Christov here.~
@55 = ~There's supposed to be an auction, but I don't know much about it. Who knows what Vengaul has planned?~
@56 = ~Vengaul? Where would he be?~
@57 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@58 = ~NP: He's new. I need to keep an eye on him. maybe ask around the people he talks to. It's not hard. He barely talks to anyone. Maybe you should talk to him. He needs to relax. You won't have a problem with me. Not after this endurance test.~ /*He's a new recruit. I've got to keep my eye on him... maybe question people he talks to. That part is easy. He doesn't say much to anyone.*/
@59 = ~Don't know. He's late, I think. Callik went to talk to him, or something. He didn't look pleased.~
@60 = ~Who is Callik?~
@61 = ~Callik is the second in command of the Bloodsailors. He's not as friendly as Vengaul. Yeah, that's for certain.~
@62 = ~Party is pretty much over in here. Not much point in sticking around.~ [NWJALE50]
