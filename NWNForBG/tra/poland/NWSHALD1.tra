@0 = ~Well hello sir. I don't recognize you. You must be new in these parts. What is an adventurous fellow like you doing in a crap-town like this?~ [NWSHA052] 
@1 = ~I didn't think it was such a bad place. What's your name anyways?~
@2 = ~Well you certainly have this place pegged. What's your name?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~A man of taste and distinction! How wonderful to meet you. My name is Shaldrissa. What's yours?~ 
@5 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Could you answer some questions?~
@6 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. It is a pleasure to meet a beautiful, young woman such as yourself.~ 
@7 = ~You just haven't gotten to know it yet. Once you spend some time here, you'll really hate it. My name is Shaldrissa. What's yours?~ 
@8 = ~(sigh) Goodbye, then.~
@9 = ~I would be happy to answer any questions you might have. I know pretty much everything that goes on in town, not that there is much to know.~
@10 = ~Have you heard anything about a cult working in the area?~
@11 = ~Is there anything unusual going on in town?~
@12 = ~Do you know where I can find a job?~
@13 = ~I need some directions.~
@14 = ~What is it that you hate about this town so much?~
@15 = ~My, a gentleman with manners. That is a rare find in a dump like this.~
@16 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@17 = ~I think you just bring out the best in me.~
@18 = ~A cult? Hah! I wish something so exciting happened in Port Llast. I am SO bored!~
@19 = ~In this town? I just told you, nothing ever happens here!~
@20 = ~Why would you want a job here in town. I guess if you must know, my father is Mayor Kendrack and I do know about one job offer. There was a prison break in Waterdeep and my father is offering a huge reward for anyone who can hunt down the escaped criminals. I only tell you about this because taking the job will help us... I mean you escape the boring clutches of this town.~ 
@21 = ~If you go north, south, or east you can get out of town. If you get on a boat and go west, you can also get out of town. Those are really all the directions you need.~
@22 = ~Are you kidding? This is just a small town, with small-minded people. If I have to stay here I'll end up a grumpy old maid with nothing to enjoy in life. A young woman with a sharp mind needs adventure... and a powerful man to protect her.~ 
@23 = ~I'm not sure I like where this is going. Why don't you answer some questions for me?~
@24 = ~That is very interesting. What else does a woman like you need?~
@25 = ~Really? I guess I was hoping to bring out the worst in you. This town bores me with its niceness.~
@26 = ~Well I certainly wouldn't want to bore you. Why don't we go talk about this somewhere more private?~
@27 = ~Mmm. Why don't we get to know each other a little more first?~
@28 = ~A woman like me needs comforting, desire, wealth and power. I can't believe I am being so open with you. You make my head spin, I... I feel overwhelmed just being so close to you. So what do you think? Would you have room for a determined young woman to follow and... assist you?~ 
@29 = ~Um, I'm going to have to think about that. First I need you to answer some questions.~
@30 = ~I don't think so. I can't be worrying about protecting you while in the middle of a fight.~
@31 = ~Perhaps we could talk more about this in the morning, when we wake up?~
@32 = ~I would love to have you along. Why don't you go get your weapons and armor and meet me back here in an hour.~
@33 = ~I'm sorry, I have to go. Goodbye.~
@34 = ~No? You good for nothing jerk! Get away from me then. I never want to see your face again!~
@35 = ~Oh, I can't do that here. If you take me with you and get me away from this place, then I'm sure we could arrange something.~
@36 = ~Weapons and armor? I don't have any. Could you lend me 1000 gold so that I could get some?~
@37 = ~1000 gold? Are you out of your mind? I'm not giving you that much!~
@38 = ~I think 200 gold would probably be enough to get you started.~
@39 = ~Okay, 1,000 gold sounds reasonable, here you go.~
@40 = ~200 gold? Are you kidding? You want me to dress like an urchin on the street? Get serious. I need 1000 gold to make a good start as an adventurer.~
@41 = ~Actually, that probably won't cover all the stuff I'm going to need. Better make that 2000.~
@42 = ~What are you buying? A golden chariot? Forget that!~
@43 = ~Well, I suppose I could give you 2000 gold.~
@44 = ~Of course that won't cover all of my debts. 3000 ought to do the trick though.~
@45 = ~I think I've had enough of this. Have a good life.~
@46 = ~Oh, no. This is too much.~
@47 = ~Why hello my lady! You must be one of the new adventurers in town. I am so excited to see that a woman of determined personality can get ahead in this world.~ [NWSHA053] 
@48 = ~Um, sure. What is your name?~
@49 = ~The power of a woman is unlimited. Never settle for less than what you deserve.~
@50 = ~My name is Shaldrissa. What do they call a bold adventuress like you?~
@51 = ~It depends on who I'm killing. I prefer to be called <CHARNAME>.~
@52 = ~Young girl, my name is <CHARNAME>. A little less youthful exuberance, please.~
@53 = ~You don't need to know my name.~
@54 = ~Oh, I so agree. It is marvelous to meet someone with such a deep understanding of the problems in life. My name is Shaldrissa. What do they call a bold adventuress like you?~ 
@55 = ~It is so exciting the way you talk. Not like anyone in this town. They are all just so boring.~
@56 = ~What exactly is wrong with this town?~
@57 = ~I would like you to answer some questions now.~
@58 = ~You are just too young and excitable. I think you should go away now.~
@59 = ~Oh, I know I get carried away. It's just that this town is so dull and stifling, it is exciting to meet someone interesting like you.~
@60 = ~Hey! That's not fair. I told you my name.~
@61 = ~Then there's your first lesson in adventuring. Life's not fair.~
@62 = ~Oh, I get it. All right, I guess I will try to remember that. You sure are wise. I wish I could live like you do.~
@63 = ~What? Sleep on the ground, in the rain? Or live minutes away from death?~
@64 = ~How rude! I don't want you to speak to me ever again!~
@65 = ~All of it! I just want to be away from this boring, dead-end town.~
@66 = ~What can you tell me about the plague in Neverwinter?~
@67 = ~Are there any jobs available?~
@68 = ~I need directions.~
@69 = ~Neverwinter? That would be somewhere not in town! Plague or not, I think it must be better than here.~
@70 = ~Are you kidding? This is a dead zone. There is nothing to do here. I can hardly wake up without yawning from boredom.~
@71 = ~There are worse things than boredom kid. Life is pretty hazardous in the outside world.~
@72 = ~Be content with your nice safe life and quit your whining.~
@73 = ~And I am sure you have experienced it all before. Don't you see, that's the opportunity I want.~
@74 = ~So why are you talking to me about it?~
@75 = ~You could take me with you! You could be my mentor and I your loyal pupil. We could become famous together.~
@76 = ~I'm not having an eager young puppy tripping me up in the middle of combat. You find your own way in life.~
@77 = ~I'm not sure. Maybe you should answer some questions for me first.~
@78 = ~That's not a bad idea. Why don't you go get your weapons and armor and meet me back here in a few minutes.~
@79 = ~No? You bitch! I'm never talking to you again.~
@80 = ~Oh dear. I don't have anything like that. I know, you give me 1000 gold so that I can run and buy some supplies.~
@81 = ~1000 gold? Not on your life!~
@82 = ~That is way too much. How about 200 gold and I'll share my food.~
@83 = ~Okay. I'll give you the money.~
@84 = ~You want me to dress like a street urchin? I don't think so. 1000 gold is only fair.~
@85 = ~Actually, that won't really be enough. How about 2000?~
@86 = ~2000? Okay.~
@87 = ~Of course that won't cover my debts here, so we had better make it 3000.~
@88 = ~All right you foolish, greedy child, you can just forget the whole thing.~
@89 = ~I must go meet someone.~ [NWSHA050]
@90 = ~I told you I never want to see you again. Go away.~ [NWSHA051]
