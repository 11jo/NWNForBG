@6 = ~NP: Thank you, <SIRMAAM>. I worry about Liisa all the time. When our mother was dying of the plague, she made me promise her that I would look after my sister. After we were attacked by Luskan, we tried to get out of the city one night, but we didn't succeed. There were Luskan soldiers everywhere. We had to hide when they passed by. It seemed like we hid for hours.~ /*When Luskan attacked we tried to sneak out of the city one night, but we couldn't get through. There were Luskan soldiers everywhere.

@14 = ~Didn't you look for her?~
@15 = ~Where did you last see her?~
@16 = ~Don't worry, I'll bring her back!~
@17 = ~NP: No, I can't show it to you. I'm afraid to even tell you what it is. Someone might steal it. There are thieves all over the place.  It's, uh. I don't even have it on me. Give me Leesa back, and I'll get it for you. I just want Leesa back soon.~ /*No, I can't show it to you. I'm afraid to even say what it is. Someone will steal it. This place is full of thieves.*/
@18 = ~Forget it. Show me the heirloom or no Leesa.~
@19 = ~NP: I had to look for her all night, till dawn. But there were so many soldiers around! If they had caught me. I can't go back there. I just can't! Poor Liisa! I had to leave her there, somewhere in the south, where the fighting is. I, uh. I had no choice.~ /*I searched all night, until the dawn came. But there were so many soldiers! If they caught me... I can't go back. I just can't!*/
