@0 = ~A fine collection. Reminds me of my days with the Adaron Aces. I tell you, we would wrangle the biggest meanest... eh... what was it we hunted? Boars! That's what it was! Vile creatures! Yes, those were the days... And these animals, it seems, are poorly fed... Why hunt such animals... Not like before... Previously, they would not have dared to put animals in cages. The animals are scared... They are scared. Is it an honor to fight them?~ 
@1 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Yes, sir, not like the old days. Not at all.~
@4 = ~Uh, hello? Can you hear me?~
@5 = ~Times sure have changed, I think.~
@6 = ~(cough) Things used to be very different. Very different.~
