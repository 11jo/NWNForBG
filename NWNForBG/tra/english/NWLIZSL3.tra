@0 = ~Ulak sabba por! Poad hisa ul pathcea fea gal!~
@1 = ~I'm sorry, I don't understand you.~
@2 = ~What are you trying to say?~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~Jula va pekito. Rawa asagus.~
@5 = ~You cannot be here! If the Mistresses catch an escaped slave in the golem room they will kill us both!~
@6 = ~Who are you?~
@7 = ~I am no escaped slave! I am a visitor from the distant future.~
@8 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@9 = ~I am one of the slaves the Mistresses have commanded to create golems. When finished, the golems will be indestructible guardians of the vault. It is forbidden for me to have contact with the other slaves on pain of death. That is why you should not be here!~ 
@10 = ~The Mistresses will not care who or what you claim to be! You are not of the Creator Race and they will destroy you if they catch you here!~
@11 = ~I will tell you what you I can, but then you must go! I cannot risk you being caught in here!~
@12 = ~What can you tell me about the Creator Race?~
@13 = ~What you build here?~
@14 = ~I am searching for one of the Words of Power.~
@15 = ~Be careful! If the Mistresses catch you, all of the slaves will be beaten as punishment... or worse!~
@16 = ~I can tell you only what is common knowledge. The Lizard People rule the world with a terrible scaled fist. They enslave us lesser races, forcing us to serve the reptilian Mistresses until our deaths. They are savage and cruel, and care nothing for those that serve them. Many slaves have perished during the building of this complex beneath the lashes of the Mistresses. I am afraid that is all I know of the Creator Race.~ 
@17 = ~The Mistresses are forcing us to build a great vault. When finished it will be protected by magical wards of smoke, light and sound, as well as the golem guardians I am working on.~
@18 = ~What can you tell me about these golem guardians?~
@19 = ~What was that you said about magical wards?~
@20 = ~Do you know what the vault protects?~
@21 = ~Thank you for your help. I will be going now.~
@22 = ~I am sorry, I have not heard of such a thing. But I am only a slave, born into servitude. My knowledge is limited to what the Mistresses tell me. Is there anything else you wish to know?~
@23 = ~When complete, the vault will be protected by three indestructible guardians: golems immune to all physical and magical attacks. My task is to complete the creation of one of these golems.~
@24 = ~Is there any way I could convince you not to finish building the golem?~
@25 = ~Once complete the vault will be protected by three wards, one each of smoke, light and sound. Once activated, each of the wards can only be deactivated from a different room within the complex where the mechanisms that power the individual wards are to be located.~
@26 = ~The Mistresses have not told me what the vault will protect. Until the magical wards are crafted to guard the vault, it lies empty and unguarded. Anyone can enter, though they would risk capture by the Masters.~
@27 = ~If I do not complete the golem the Mistresses will torture me until I beg for death... and then they will grant it to me in gruesome fashion.~
@28 = ~I could free you from your enslavement.~
@29 = ~I could give you gold. Lots of it!~
@30 = ~Here is Lokar's ring. He said you would help me.~
@31 = ~I do not know the secret to deactivating the wards once they are finished, but I imagine you would have to solve the riddles of smoke, light and sound to gain entry once the wards are in place. And once my work here is complete, the golems will have to be vanquished as well.~
@32 = ~Where would I go? The lizard people rule the entire world! I would be a fugitive forever on the run, knowing a horrible fate awaits if I am captured. I am a high ranking, privileged slave. I am given private quarters and bountiful food. I am allowed to choose a mate and I am rarely beaten. Your offer is nothing compared to that.~ 
@33 = ~Please, if you help me it will strike a great blow against the tyranny of the Creator Race that has enslaved you.~
@34 = ~What use would gold serve me? I am not allowed property, I cannot buy anything with it. If the Mistresses find it they will take it and no doubt whip me for being a thief. I am a high ranking, privileged slave. I am given private quarters and bountiful food. I am allowed to choose a mate and I am rarely beaten. Your offer is nothing compared to that.~ 
@35 = ~Why did you not say so earlier? If Lokar sent you, your mission must be one of great importance to the fate of all those enslaved by the Creator Race! If I do not build the golem the Mistresses will know I have aided you. But it might be possible for me to construct the golem with a single subtle flaw they will not detect. This will give the golem one fatal vulnerability.~ 
@36 = ~There is something strange about you. You seem more than an escaped slave. Perhaps you speak the truth. If I aid you I am taking a terrible risk but it would be worth it if you could truly strike a blow against the Mistresses. If I do not build the golem the Mistresses will know I have aided you. But it might be possible for me to construct the golem with a single subtle flaw they will not detect. This will give the golem one fatal vulnerability.~ 
@37 = ~I am sorry, but the risk is too great. I will not help you and if you kill me they will simply find another slave to replace me. The golem will be built regardless. There is nothing you can say to persuade me.~
@38 = ~I can only introduce one flaw. Should I introduce more, the Mistresses will surely notice. Would you rather I make the golem vulnerable to fire, cold, blunt weapons or slashing and piercing weapons?~
@39 = ~Fire.~
@40 = ~Cold.~
@41 = ~Blunt weapons.~
@42 = ~Slashing and piercing weapons.~
@43 = ~I shall do as you have asked. However, my change will only affect the golem I am working on. There are other golems, but you would have to speak to the slaves building them or they will be invulnerable. Now please go before the Mistresses see you here.~ 
@44 = ~Do not worry, we will make the Golem vulnerable to fire as you have asked us.~
@45 = ~I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to cold instead.~
@46 = ~I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons instead.~
@47 = ~I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons.~
@48 = ~We will do as you say.~
@49 = ~Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to cold as you have asked us.~
@50 = ~I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to fire instead.~
@51 = ~Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons as you have asked us.~
@52 = ~Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons as you have asked us.~
