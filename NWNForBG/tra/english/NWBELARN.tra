@0 = ~Yes? Is there something you require? These dark days have left my mind on other things so make it brief.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I can spare a few moments from my worrying. What is it that you wish to know?~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Have you paid your safety tax?~
@8 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll both live to talk another time...~
@9 = ~I am to be your simple guide? Hmph... Though if it would help toward a cure, I suppose I should endeavor to answer.~
@10 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@11 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@12 = ~It has cost me my business, for one. I was visiting friends in the City Core when the quarantine came down. My store is now empty and forgotten beyond those gates.~
@13 = ~How has the plague affected the nobility?~
@14 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@15 = ~NP: There is another question.~ /*I want to ask something else.*/
@16 = ~I don't sully myself by discussing mere conjecture. If you wish salacious details I suggest you look elsewhere. The different districts will each hold intrigues, I am sure. All but the Blacklake seem to do as they will when out from under the rule of law.~ /*The different districts will each hold intrigues, I am sure. All but the Blacklake seem to do as they will when out from under the rule of law.*/
@17 = ~Err... I'm not sure what you mean. Safety tax?~
@18 = ~Yeah. I could kill you easy. Be safe. Pay me to go away.~
@19 = ~Uh, nothing. Back to my other questions.~
@20 = ~Don't start that with me. I've already paid out all I've got, so just ask your questions and go.~
@21 = ~Very well, if this dreaded Wailing makes me serve as your signpost... Neverwinter is divided into five districts, each encompassing a particular industrious theme. Which would you have questions about? The Beggar's Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, or the City Core?~ /*Very well, if this dreaded Wailing makes me serve as your signpost... Neverwinter is divided into five districts, each encompassing a particular industrious theme.*/
@22 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@23 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@24 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@25 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@26 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula.~
@27 = ~The irony is not lost on me - I could have shown you to my own stock, once, and made a tidy profit from you, too... Instead, I point you to other establishments...~
@28 = ~NP: She *kills* us! The plague doesn't care: what are we, what are poor peasants. Where are all the privileges of our class now... I hope we don't let the Howling Death take us so easily. Lord Nasher and the Helmites haven't done anything worthwhile yet.~ /*Hopefully we will do more than just let the Wailing take us. The actions of Lord Nasher and the Helmites have been underwhelming.*/
@29 = ~I have trusted associates that say a cure was being assembled, but something apparently disrupted the attempt. An attack, they say. This information has wisely been kept from the masses. Can you imagine the panic? Actually, I probably shouldn't have even told *you*.~ /*This information has wisely been kept from the masses. Can you imagine the panic? Actually, I probably shouldn't have even told *you*.*/
@30 = ~I don't threaten easy. I'll just call a guard and you'll be hauled off to prison!~
@31 = ~I AM a guard, and guards stick together. Pay up or you are dead!~
@32 = ~You are right, of course. I apologize.~
@33 = ~NP: The heart of the city, oh lord of verbosity, this is where we are now. Here you can find all the main services. Castle Nevers is located in the west of the center. It is located on the &quot;upper square&quot; along with important spiritual and cultural institutions. On the edge of the district, however, there are some rather suspicious places... but for the most part, militia quarantine keeps us safe from the Howling Plague.~ /*The district edge, however, is possessed of more suspect establishments... for the most part, however, the militia's quarantine has kept us free of the Wailing.*/
@34 = ~I know little of the Beggar's Nest, but that's hardly a failing. Only the poor and morally suspect willingly visit such a place.~
@35 = ~It is ripe with the Wailing and I suspect that is where the plague first manifested. Hardly a surprise with all the filth that make their homes there.~
@36 = ~Not only is the Wailing out of control there... like everywhere... but they also had zombies rising out of the Great Graveyard! Horrible! Luckily, some stalwart hero of the city guard took care of that mess. I'm not sure what happened, but I am told it was impressive.~ /*Luckily, some stalwart hero of the city guard took care of that mess. I'm not sure what happened, but I am told it was impressive.*/
@37 = ~I don't concern myself with the Docks. I have subordinates to handle the day-to-day workings of business and shipping... at least, I used to...~
@38 = ~My business and I have ended up on separate sides of the quarantine, I'm afraid. I cannot guess what has become of my dockhands now.~
@39 = ~Thieves were overrunning the place. That gentleman pirate Vengaul Bloodsail had something to do with it. I am told one of the city's new recruits settled it though. The quarantine still keeps me from my business and dockhands, but at least it will be a little safer when we get back to business.~ /*Thieves were overrunning the place. That gentleman pirate Vengaul Bloodsail had something to do with it. I am told one of the city's new recruits settled it though.*/
@40 = ~Ahh, only the best of us make our homes in the Blacklake district. It was the most privileged of the districts until it, too, fell within the Wailing's grasp.~
@41 = ~Not even the status of residents could prevent the encroachement of the plague, though I hear some have... Ah, but I should speak no more of this.~
@42 = ~Certainly you can tell me.~
@43 = ~I understand there was trouble there recently. Someone has put an end to it, however, and nothing of interest about the place comes to mind.~
@44 = ~NP: Your manners are disarming! I think I can point you to some circumstances. They may interest you. I hope that the common people will understand that the ruling class knows best. I don't have to say much. Suffice it to say that some aristocrats from Black Lake want to make sure they survive the plague.~ /*I really shouldn't give away any more. Suffice to say that certain nobles of Blacklake are making certain they survive this mess.*/
@45 = ~Are you suggesting a revolt of some sort?~
@46 = ~No, I rather think not. Blacklake district will handle its own affairs, thank you.~
@47 = ~A revolt? Why should the nobles revolt when they already hold the power! I merely suggested that provisions are being made for certain citizens of Blacklake to survive the plague. If you wish to know more of the matter, you should go to the district yourself. Trapped on this side of the quarantine, I am hardly current on such matters.~ /*A revolt? Why should the nobles revolt when they already hold the power! I merely suggested that provisions are being made for certain citizens of Blacklake to survive the plague.*/
@48 = ~Bah! What should I know of the Peninsula? It's a haven for those either caged in the prison or recently released from it. That district is held to the thinnest thread of law by Captain Alaefin, the Head Gaoler. I have seen little of him since the cursed Wailing came.~ /*That district is held to the thinnest thread of law by Captain Alaefin, the Head Gaoler. I have seen little of him since the cursed Wailing came.*/
@49 = ~I choose not to think of that place right now. Captain Alaefin was a friend to all of Neverwinter, and now it seems he has met his end in the prison there. I don't know the circumstance of it, but apparently he went mad for some reason. At least order has been restored in the Peninsula now.~ /*I choose not to think of that place right now. Captain Alaefin was a friend to all of Neverwinter, and now it seems he has met his end in the prison there.*/
@50 = ~NP: You look a bit gangster. You should probably visit the Moonstone Mask, it's in the southeast, right at the main gate. In my position, it is not recommended to know about such places - it is indecent even to mention it. If you need people, go to the Sword Fair, it's a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*You look a bit of a scoundrel. You may want to visit the Moonstone Mask, near the Peninsula Gate in the City Core west.*/
@51 = ~NP: You look like a person who is interested in nature. Perhaps you should visit the Druid Tree, it is in the southwest of the district, next to the gate. If you need people, go to the Sword Fair, it's a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*You look the type to be concerned with the interests of nature. Perhaps you should visit the Druid Tree on the east side of the City Core's upper square.*/
@52 = ~NP: Are you religious? Perhaps you should visit the Temple of Tyr in the Heart of the City. It's on the west side, next to Nevers Castle. If you need people, go to the Sword Fair, it's a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*Are you a pious individual? Perhaps you would benefit from visiting the Temple of Tyr in the City Core on the west side of the City Core's upper square.*/
@53 = ~NP: Do you like everything secret and mysterious? Then you will want to look into the Cloak Tower, it is in the east of the district. If you need people, go to the Sword Fair, it's a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*Are you of an arcane bent? You might wish to make yourself known at the Cloaktower, just outside Castle Never.*/
@54 = ~NP: You must be skilled with weapons. Try to go to &quot;Shining Weapons and Armor for Knights&quot;. It's just south of the main square. If you need people, go to the Sword Fair, it's a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*You look handy with a weapon. You might wish to visit Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core.*/
@55 = ~NP: You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to &quot;Shining Weapons and Armor for Knights&quot;, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Well, thieves are welcome in the Mask of the Moonstone. If you need people, go to the Sword Fair, it's a mercenary camp in the southeast.~ /*The workmanship responsible for this item is questionable, at best. A small plaque declares it to be a partially nude representation of Ophala Cheldarstorn of the Moonstone Mask, but you cannot see how it could be an accurate likeness.*/
@56 = ~W-what? All right, all right, just don't hurt me. I'll give you what I have, and you take it and get out of my sight.~
@57 = ~That's better. Now I suggest you ask your questions and leave. I am in a hurry.~
@58 = ~You will leave me be! I have no desire to speak with the likes of you! You disgust me!~
@59 = ~I've no desire to speak with someone as rough-hewn as you, least of all in times such as these. Leave me be.~
