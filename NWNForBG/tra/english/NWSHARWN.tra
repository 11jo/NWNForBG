@0 = ~Who's this? Some poor soul straggling in off the diseased streets? Are you here to join our ranks and beg for an employer... or are you actually here to hire someone?~ [NWSHAR51]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~And if I said I was looking for work?~
@3 = ~I might be looking for a henchman.~
@4 = ~I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.~
@5 = ~My name is Sharwyn, and I call this city my home. I seek adventure and excitement... if you seek the same, you'd be smart to hire me to accompany you.~
@6 = ~You're a local girl, are you?~
@7 = ~And if I don't seek adventure and excitement?~
@8 = ~You seem pretty sure of yourself.~
@9 = ~And just what skills do you have?~
@10 = ~I'd say not to hold your breath. With everyone dropping like flies in this city, the only opportunity for employment is as a gravedigger or charlatan. You don't strike me as either of those. Why not tell me what you're really here for?~ /*I'd say not to hold your breath. With everyone dropping like flies in this city, the only opportunity for employment is as a gravedigger or charlatan.*/
@11 = ~Why not tell me who you are, first?~
@12 = ~My business is my own.~
@13 = ~Is that so? Then I shall have to re-form my impression of you. Who are you, then, that you have coin to spare on hiring help?~
@14 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@15 = ~Who are you that you interrogate possible employers?~
@16 = ~I never said I would hire *you*, did I?~
@17 = ~Have I scared you off already? Oh well. Do come back once you grow yourself a backbone, my <LADYLORD>.~
@18 = ~Does that make a difference? I see people I've known my whole life falling to sickness all around me. I'd say that gives me more motivation than most. And, incidentally, I am no 'girl'.~
@19 = ~I find that hard to believe, somehow. You strike me as a bard, much like myself. Are you claiming that you have no wish to create you own legend similar to those you've heard your entire life?~
@20 = ~What is it to be, then? Duty and honor? Power and riches? Somehow I doubt it matters, as I'm willing to bet you'll find adventure and excitement along your path regardless of whether or not you seek them.~
@21 = ~I know what I want and I know what I like when I see it. Such as you... you're a fine-looking <RACE> man. We could make a fine team, you and I.~
@22 = ~I know what I want and I seek it out. We could make a fine team, you and I... if you're of a mind. Don't try and deny it.~
@23 = ~I am a caster of bardic magic, a master of all skills and a teller of the oldest legends... and with or without your help, I intend to achieve my own fame in my time. One day bards will sing their songs about me. I suppose such talk may make me seem arrogant to you, my <LADYLORD>. If so, I don't particularly care. I've known the path I was on for a long time... I left behind a life of riches to live the life of a bard.~ /*I suppose such talk may make me seem arrogant to you, my <LADYLORD>. If so, I don't particularly care. I've known the path I was on for a long time... I left behind a life of riches to live the life of a bard.*/
@24 = ~You left behind a life of riches?~
@25 = ~You're right... you do seem arrogant.~
@26 = ~I think such confidence is admirable.~
@27 = ~Fair enough. Perhaps I should introduce myself, first, then.~
@28 = ~Hah! No, you didn't. I would be willing to bet, however, that were you of a mind to do so... well, you wouldn't regret it. But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Perhaps a proper introduction is in order, yes?~ /*But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Perhaps a proper introduction is in order, yes?*/
@29 = ~If my own family had had its way, I would be by now comfortably married to a wealthy man I could never respect, bored to tears in my large Blacklake district mansion. How odd a game the fates play. My family lies mostly dead, now, and Blacklake is full of frightened fools who bury their heads in the sand and pretend the plague won't touch them.~ /*If my own family had had its way, I would be by now comfortably married to a wealthy man I could never respect, bored to tears in my large Blacklake district mansion.*/
@30 = ~What do you know about the Blacklake district?~
@31 = ~I'm looking for someone to help me in my mission.~
@32 = ~Surprise, surprise, I don't care what you think. I've endured worse scorn from better, my <LADYLORD>, and survived.~
@33 = ~Thank you. You're not the typical sort of <MANWOMAN> yourself, are you?~
@34 = ~Plenty. It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist than actually try to help. There are those within the district who are trying to rally the rich to aid the rest of the city, but their cries mostly fall on deaf ears. One day the plague will come to them in force, and they shall regret their selfishness.~ /*Plenty. It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist than actually try to help.*/
@35 = ~Anything else you can tell me about Blacklake?~
@36 = ~So I understand. Might you be able to illuminate me as to the nature of this mission of yours?~
@37 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that might be used to find a plague cure.~
@38 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@39 = ~Is there much else to tell? It is perhaps the one place in this city that remains yet orderly and plague-free, although getting inside its walls may be a bit of a problem. There are some elements of seediness, perhaps... every place you find the rich, you find places where they can indulge their strangest tastes. I understand the local tavern's basement has its... distractions.~ /*There are some elements of seediness, perhaps... every place you find the rich, you find places where they can indulge their strangest tastes. I understand the local tavern's basement has its... distractions.*/
@40 = ~Aribeth is Lord Nasher's servant... so your mission is bound to be exciting. Hmmm. Yes, I think I'd rather like to join you... if the price is right.~
@41 = ~Oh? Well, have it your way. If you're working for Lady Aribeth, I imagine it's something of great importance. Aribeth is Lord Nasher's servant... so your mission is bound to be exciting. Hmmm. Yes, I think I'd rather like to join you... if the price is right.~ /*Aribeth is Lord Nasher's servant... so your mission is bound to be exciting. Hmmm. Yes, I think I'd rather like to join you... if the price is right.*/
@42 = ~One thing I know for sure, if you intend to get anywhere in Blacklake, you'd best rely on charm rather than muscle. Or maybe bring a companion who knows the terrain?~
@43 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some help to assist me on my mission.~
@44 = ~No thanks. Goodbye.~
@45 = ~My skills don't come cheaply, however. I'll follow you gladly and to the best of my ability, my <LADYLORD>... provided my price is met. Hmmm... What will be the price? Well, you seem to be a <MALEFEMALE> the kind of person who can be trusted. 750 gold and I'm yours.~
@46 = ~Here's your 750 gold. Welcome aboard, Sharwyn.~
@47 = ~That seems a little expensive. I'll give you 600.~
@48 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@49 = ~Fair enough, my <LADYLORD>. I am at your disposal.~
@50 = ~Oh, fine, fine. I suppose a bit of gold now isn't the most important thing. I am at your disposal, my <LADYLORD>.~
@51 = ~I am not a crate of salt to be haggled over. 750 gold or nothing.~
@52 = ~You expect me to work for free, then? Don't be naive. Come back when you have something more to offer than promises, all right?~
@53 = ~Come back, have you? What do you require now?~ [NWSHAR52]
@54 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@55 = ~Questions, is it? I may be from Neverwinter, but I'm not here to be pumped for information by anyone new to the city. I'm here looking for work. I suppose I could tell you a little about the Blacklake district, perhaps, as I am from there... but that's it. Otherwise let me know if you need some actual hired help or not.~ /*I suppose I could tell you a little about the Blacklake district, perhaps, as I am from there... but that's it. Otherwise let me know if you need some actual hired help or not.*/
@56 = ~So we meet again, <CHARNAME>. The others had told me Aribeth had recruited you to find the cultists... I can't say I'm surprised. You've acquired quite the reputation for yourself, haven't you?~ [NWSHAR53]
@57 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Sharwyn.~
@58 = ~You again? What, are you following me around?~
@59 = ~Goodbye.~
@60 = ~And why is that? Just because we went our separate ways in Neverwinter, I'm supposed to disappear off the face of Faerun? If you haven't noticed, there's a shortage of good adventurers. Lady Aribeth approached me at the Trade of Blades to hire me on Lord Nasher's behalf... just as you were, I imagine.~ /*And why is that? Just because we went our separate ways in Neverwinter, I'm supposed to disappear off the face of Faerun? If you haven't noticed, there's a shortage of good adventurers.*/
@61 = ~Like I have nothing better to do, I suppose? No, I've my own skills, thank you... and my own reasons for being here.~
@62 = ~If you need me, you know where I am.~
@63 = ~It looks to me like Lord Nasher is pulling out all the stops to find this cult. The search in Neverwinter is immense, and we mercenaries have been sent to Port Llast to join the effort with you and Aribeth. Lucky us.~
@64 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@65 = ~How much would it cost to hire your services?~
@66 = ~I've been paid good coin for my services by Lord Nasher, actually. It's another chance at acquiring some fame, in my eyes... even though I've been told to merely offer assistance to you and Aribeth, for now. So... do you need my help?~ /*It's another chance at acquiring some fame, in my eyes... even though I've been told to merely offer assistance to you and Aribeth, for now. So... do you need my help?*/
@67 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@68 = ~I could use someone by my side.~
@69 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@70 = ~The cult could be practically anywhere. You may want to look in the hills near the crossroads, right at the exit of the town... I've heard many tales of monsters raiding the roads nearby in force.~
@71 = ~Monsters?~
@72 = ~It's about time you asked. I'm at your disposal, <CHARNAME>.~
@73 = ~Bugbears and orcs, mostly. Apparently they were being directed by some humans, however, which would make it quite odd. At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.~ /*At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.*/
@74 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. I trust you remember me, yes? The bard, Sharwyn? It's been rather boring standing around waiting for Aribeth to get her act together... I'd rather be out looking for this cult, making a name for myself while I'm at it.~ [NWSHAR55] /*It's been rather boring standing around waiting for Aribeth to get her act together... I'd rather be out looking for this cult, making a name for myself while I'm at it.*/
@75 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@76 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@77 = ~If you're so interested in fame, why are you standing around here?~
@78 = ~Of course. Lord Nasher has spared no expense in mobilizing an entire army to look for this cult. The search in Neverwinter is enormous. I and these other mercenaries have been sent out to these parts to search, which is fine by me. More chances for fame in a smaller group.~ /*I and these other mercenaries have been sent out to these parts to search, which is fine by me. More chances for fame in a smaller group.*/
@79 = ~Well, it could be that I enjoy being bored... or it could be that my instructions are to aid you and Aribeth, and I haven't been told to do anything, yet. So how about it? You got the gumption to take me with you, <CHARNAME>? It would be far more interesting than standing around, here.~ /*Well, it could be that I enjoy being bored... or it could be that my instructions are to aid you and Aribeth, and I haven't been told to do anything, yet.*/
@80 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra hand. You're in.~
@81 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@82 = ~Excellent. I am at your disposal, then. I'll tag along as you need me, <CHARNAME>.~
@83 = ~Well, well, well... you must be <CHARNAME>, correct? The legendary savior of Neverwinter? I've heard a couple of ballads written about you, already.~ [NWSHAR54]
@84 = ~Well, I wasn't acting alone.~
@85 = ~Yes, that would be me.~
@86 = ~Is that so? Modesty is the last thing I would expect to find in the great <CHARNAME>.~
@87 = ~Ballads so rarely tell the truth, however. I should know. Ha ha! My name is Sharwyn, <CHARNAME>, a bard and master of skills... I suspect we have been hired for the same purpose. To find these cultists and stamp them out, yes?~
