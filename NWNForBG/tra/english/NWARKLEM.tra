@0 = ~Ah. I see the fly in the ointment has finally arrived.~
@1 = ~And who are you?~
@2 = ~You were expecting me?~
@3 = ~So you're... Maugrim?~
@4 = ~NP: The one who followed your every step in this tower with great interest,<MALEFEMALE> . You are distinguished by amazing determination and perseverance. I contacted my dear Nifitis, and she told me a lot about you. Unfortunately, she didn't manage to get to my hideout like you did, otherwise I would have been free by now.~ /*I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.*/
@5 = ~You are Arklem Greeth, then... the former Archmage Arcane.~
@6 = ~You know of me? I have no idea who you are.~
@7 = ~Another one of Maugrim's prisoners, then?~
@8 = ~NP: The one who followed your every step in this tower with great interest,<MALEFEMALE> . You are distinguished by amazing determination and perseverance. I was the owner of this tower long before this invader came here. I immediately felt your presence even from here, from this small prison.~ /*I was the master of this tower long before the usurper took his place. I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.*/
@9 = ~NP: Does that surprise you? This tower is a kind of living being. For someone who, like me, is used to its rhythms, you are now like an elephant in a china shop. I contacted my dear Nifitis, and she told me a lot about you. Unfortunately, she did not manage to reach my hideout like you did, otherwise I would have been free by now.~ /*I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.*/
@10 = ~NP: Does that surprise you? This tower is a kind of living being. For someone who, like me, is used to its rhythms, you are now like an elephant in a china shop. I was the owner of this tower long before this invader came here. I immediately felt your presence even from here, from this small prison.~ /*I was the master of this tower long before the usurper took his place. I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.*/
@11 = ~NP: Don't be stupid<MALEFEMALE> . Do you think that the new 'owner' of the tower will quietly wait for you to arrive in a magical cage? Don't think. I contacted my dear Nifitis, and she told me a lot about you. Unfortunately, she didn't manage to get to my hideout like you did, otherwise I would have been free by now.~ /*I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.*/
@12 = ~NP: Don't be stupid<MALEFEMALE> . Do you think that the new 'owner' of the tower will quietly wait for you to arrive in a magical cage? Don't think. I was the owner of this tower long before this invader came here. I immediately felt your presence even from here, from this small prison.~ /*I was the master of this tower long before the usurper took his place. I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.*/
@13 = ~NP: So, the glory of me flies ahead of me. Yes... Your mouth speaks the truth, little mortal. I fled that tower when I learned of Maugrim's true intentions, but it was still too late. Mawgrim has power beyond your imagination. His mistress favors him... and even the power this... form gave me... couldn't save me from captivity.~ /*So my own reputation precedes me. Yes... you have the right of it, little mortal. I fled the tower when Maugrim showed his true intention, but not quickly enough.*/
@14 = ~You are a lich! An undead thing!~
@15 = ~Maybe you're just weaker than you thought.~
@16 = ~Interesting. Transformed yourself into a lich, have you?~
@17 = ~NP: Fi. Feeling your way up the tower on behalf of some idiot, having no idea where you are. Doesn't matter. My name is Arklem Greet, little mortal. It was I who was once the archmage of the Brotherhood of Mysteries. I fled that tower when I learned of Maugrim's true intentions, but it was still too late.~ /*Bah. Blundering about the tower on some fool's errand, no doubt, without a thought as to where you are. No matter. My name is Arklem Greeth, little mortal.*/
@18 = ~NP: Oh yeah. I am Maugrim's treasure, if you want to know, little mortal. I am Arklem Greet... former archmage of the Brotherhood of Mysteries. Mawgrim has power beyond your imagination. His mistress favors him... and even the power this... form gave me... couldn't save me from captivity.~ /*Maugrim has power you cannot even imagine. His mistress favors him... and even the power granted me by this... form... could not resist capture in the end.*/
@19 = ~NP: Really. Don't get angry, mortal. Our interests are aligned at the moment, don't you think? Release me from this magical prison, mortal. You help me... And I'll help you.~ /*Indeed. Do not get yourself in a huff about it, mortal. At the moment, our interests rather coincide, don't you think?*/
@20 = ~I have some questions, first.~
@21 = ~Why would I free you?~
@22 = ~Can you reward me for letting you go?~
@23 = ~I'd rather kill you where you stand, creature!~
@24 = ~NP: Mawgrim took me by surprise, mortal. His power exceeded all my expectations. But he is still my enemy... Which means that our interests are the same here, don't you think? Release me from this magical prison, mortal. You help me... And I'll help you.~ /*Maugrim caught me by surprise, mortal. His power far surpassed anything I had suspected in him. Regardless, he is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide rather nicely, don't you think?*/
@25 = ~NP: Actually, yes, on the advice of Nifitis. It turned out to be very useful... both for me and for the Brotherhood. Maugrim... surprised us all. He is my enemy... And this means that our interests coincide here, doesn't it? Release me from this magical prison, mortal. You help me... And I'll help you.~ /*I have, at Nyphithys's advice, in fact. It has proven remarkably beneficial... both for myself and the brotherhood. Maugrim was a... a surprise. He is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide, yes?*/
@26 = ~Naturally. Go ahead, mortal. I'd be interested to hear what you have to ask.~
@27 = ~What do you know about Maugrim and his cult?~
@28 = ~Do you know if Aribeth is with Maugrim?~
@29 = ~Why is Maugrim keeping you captive? Why not kill you?~
@30 = ~Would you be willing to help me fight Maugrim?~
@31 = ~That's enough questions.~
@32 = ~NP: Yah? How about this my unimaginative friend<RACE> ? See that door leading to the gazebo? Have you thought about trying to open it? It's locked securely... with spells that I'm sure you with your powers will never be able to remove. I also know that Maugrim is behind it. That's what you're here for, isn't it?~ /*It is locked tightly... with spells that I'm positive you have no ability to break. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?*/
@33 = ~NP: Will I reward you? Of course my friend<RACE> . I will reward you. See that door that leads to the gazebo? Have you thought about trying to open it? It's locked securely... with spells that I'm sure even you with your powers will never be able to remove. I also know that Maugrim is behind it. That's what you're here for, isn't it?~ /*It is locked tightly... with spells that I'm quite sure are beyond even your ability to dispel. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?*/
@34 = ~NP: Is it true? You have a sense of humor, mortal. Of course you can try to kill me. But Maugrim's spells that keep me here won't let you do that... However, you can try whenever you want. Maybe we'd better discuss your options... or rather your lack of them, huh?~ /*Oh, truly? You are an amusing one, mortal. You can certainly try to kill me. The spells Maugrim has enveloped me in to keep me here would prevent your success... but you are free to try.*/
@35 = ~Forget it! I'll take my chances!~
@36 = ~NP: Ah, that's a good question. I myself have thought much about the nature of Lady Maugrim. How does she give him such strength? You see, the plague was unleashed to increase its power. Every death in Neverwinter fed her life force. And I know she wants more power. Mawgrim is desperately searching for what he calls the 'Words of Power'. As far as I understand, these are ancient artifacts... There are four of them in total, although I personally never heard anything about them before Mawgrim mentioned them. He possesses only one of them, but his mistress is eager to have them all.~ /*Maugrim is desperate to find what he calls the 'Words of Power'. They are ancient artifacts I believe... four in total, though I had never heard of them before Maugrim, himself, made mention. He holds only one, but his mistress wishes them all.*/
@37 = ~NP: This elf, Guardian of Darkness? Oh yeah. She came with him and is behind this door. If you hurry, you can catch her. Do you have any more questions?~ /*The elven blackguard? Indeed. She came with him and lies beyond that door. If you hurry, you just might catch her.*/
@38 = ~NP: This tower still has many secrets, which only I am privy to. If Maugrim knew what I know, he would already know of your presence... and you wouldn't be able to get that far. Consider yourself lucky. If I didn't think you'd actually be able to hurt that idiot, I might have amused myself by warning Maugrim that you were coming this way. Do you have any more questions?~ /*There are many secrets of this tower that are yet mine alone. If Maugrim knew what I knew, he would already be aware of you... and you would not have made it so far.*/
@39 = ~NP: Of course not. Continue your silly adventures on your own. I am going to leave this tower and reunite with my dear Nifitis. If you're lucky, you'll be able to weaken Maugrim... or at least lure him out of this tower. And I'll take advantage of that later. Do you have any more questions?~ /*With luck, you will at least weaken Maugrim... or at least drive him from this tower. I intend to take advantage of that, in time.*/
@40 = ~Then what shall it be? Will you free me now?~
@41 = ~How do I get you out of there, then?~
@42 = ~NP: I have created spells that will prevent this door from being opened. I can open it for you... but only when you release me. It's either that or... You'll have to get out of here. With nothing. Well, what do you say now, mortal? Do you have a choice?~ /*I created the spells that hold the door. I can open it for you... but only if I am freed. It's either that or... you are certainly free to return whence you came. In failure.*/
@43 = ~(sigh) You mortals with your limited minds. Very well... do as you wish, if it satisfies your perverse sense of independence.~
@44 = ~NP: What these 'Words of Power' will bring to Maugrim and his mistress, one can only guess... You can certainly imagine it. It'll be fun to watch you try to stop them if that's what you want. Do you have any more questions?~ /*What these 'Words of Power' would do for Maugrim and his mistress one can only guess... I'm sure you can. It would amuse me to see you halt their efforts, if that is your goal.*/
@45 = ~NP: Do you see the three braziers that surround me? They feed the magical energy with which Maugrim keeps me here ... About the same as they kept Nephitis. They are protected by their own magic... it's too much for me to overcome it on my own. However, if you manage to damage them... And I would combine my power with yours... When they are destroyed, I will be free.~ /*They are protected by their own magic... too much for me to overcome on my own. If you were to damage them, however... and I was to add my power to yours... they could be destroyed, and I freed.*/
@46 = ~NP: Do you see the three braziers that surround me? They feed the magical energy that Mawgrim keeps me here... They are protected by their own magic... it's too much for me to overcome on my own. However, if you manage to damage them... And I would combine my power with yours... When they are destroyed, I will be free.~ /*They are protected by their own magic... too much for me to overcome on my own. If you were to damage them, however... and I was to add my power to yours... they could be destroyed, and I freed.*/
@47 = ~Attack them however you wish and I will turn my own efforts toward aiding you. Then I shall open the door to my sanctum for you... and I shall leave.~
@48 = ~How do I know I can trust you?~
@49 = ~What's to keep me from killing you afterwards?~
@50 = ~NP: And you're not very smart<MALEFEMALE> . I can't be trusted. You can, however, believe that I would rather get out of here than personally deal with you. Do you have another choice? Then leave. I'm tired of this cell. I'd rather see Mawgrim dance than the fury of someone like you<RACE> .~ /*Foolish <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You can't. You can trust, however, that I would rather be away from here than deal with you myself. Have you another choice?*/
@51 = ~NP: Hmm. Of course, you can try, dumbass... However, I assure you, I'm not going to stay here long enough for you to break my defenses. Then leave. I'm tired of this cell. I'd rather see Mawgrim dance than the fury of someone like you<RACE> .~ /*Hmph. You can certainly try if you wish, fool... I will not remain here long enough for you to break through my own protections, however, I can assure you.*/
@52 = ~So? Will you free me or no, little mortal?~
@53 = ~Wait a minute... who are you?~
@54 = ~I am waiting, fool. Destroy the braziers and I will add my power to yours. I desire to be free!~
@55 = ~It is done! I am free at last! Would that I could visit vengeance upon Maugrim for this indignity myself!~
@56 = ~NP: But you... You want to be the fly in the ointment of Maugrim's honey, don't you? For me this is enough. I will tell you of his plans, little mortal. Have you ever thought about the nature of Lady Maugrim? How does she give him such power? You see, the plague was unleashed to increase its power. Every death in Neverwinter fed her life force. And I know she's hungry for even more power.~ /*The plague was loosed to strengthen her, you see. Each death in Neverwinter fed her with new life-force. And I know she seeks even more power, yet.*/
@57 = ~I give you thanks for my freedom, mortal. I shall open the door to my sanctum... you may deal with Maugrim at your leisure. Do not be here, however, when I return.~
@58 = ~NP: Mawgrim is desperately searching for what he calls the 'Words of Power'. As far as I understand, these are ancient artifacts... There are four of them in total, although I personally never heard anything about them before Mawgrim mentioned them. He possesses only one of them, but his mistress wants to have them all.

Maybe we'd better discuss your options... or rather your lack of them, huh?~ /*Oh, truly? You are an amusing one, mortal. You can certainly try to kill me.
