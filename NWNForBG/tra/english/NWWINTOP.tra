@0 = ~The nobles in the Blacklake district have sealed themselves away from everyone. There's something strange there, mark my words!~
@1 = ~The nobles in the Blacklake have been put in their place, I hear. I hope, anyway. They're too full of themselves at the best of times.~
@2 = ~They say plague-corpses walk the streets in the Beggar's Nest, feasting on the living!~
@3 = ~Corpses were walking the Beggar's Nest! They've been stopped, now, but who knows what's coming next!~
@4 = ~Well, wonderful. Another <RACE> lout wandering about. Plague carriers are what your kind are!~
@5 = ~The militia can't keep order anymore! The guards in the Core don't even care that there was a prison break in the Penisula district.~
@6 = ~I heard there were lots of people dead after the prison break in the Peninsula. Glad it's over. The plague kills enough of us.~
@7 = ~A word of advice: be careful. If you catch the Wailing Death, it'll be *your* corpse we smell burning.~
@8 = ~You aren't with those pirates in the Docks, are you? I thought they were only around the Nelanther Isles. Guess I don't know much.~
@9 = ~You must be from up in the mountains... maybe even the Spine of the World? The plague spread up there yet?~
@10 = ~Think carrying that weapon will keep the Wailing Death at bay? May as well spit in the Anauroch!~
@11 = ~There's anarchy in the Docks district! I heard criminals have taken over and the city guard are afraid to go in there now.~
@12 = ~I heard the Docks district is quieter now. Maybe I should go there. I really need to get away from the smell of burning flesh.~
@13 = ~Hmph. Keep your magic to yourself around here, <SIRMAAM>. Some blame sorcery for the plague! They might banish mages to the Mere of Dead Men. Maybe.~
