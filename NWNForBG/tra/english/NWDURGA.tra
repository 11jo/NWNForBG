@0 = ~Yes? Is there something you need? The Shining Knight has what you need.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Let's see what you have for sale.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~I'm just a merchant. What it is you want me to say?~
@5 = ~I'm looking for premium equipment.~
@6 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@7 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@8 = ~Always open if you've got the gold.~
@9 = ~Hmm... Not sure what you're after, really. My stock is the best you'll find for honest coin.~
@10 = ~It's cut into my sales, that's what I know, and my supplies are running out. My blacksmith Marrok has had to offer his services at barely above the cost of materials.~
@11 = ~I don't have time for rumors. I guard the shop from looters and plague-sick. That's all that matters.~
@12 = ~I mean, you've already got a ward for the back room. That's where Marrok makes the good stuff. He'll set you up.~
@13 = ~NP: You seem to be very knowledgeable about guns. Maybe-- Ah, screw it. I have something special for you. Take this pebble. It's a pass to the back room. That's where Marrok makes all the good stuff. He'll take care of you.~ /*You look like you really know your way around a weapon. Maybe... yeah, what the hell. I got something special for you.*/
@14 = ~NP: Well, really, you're not the armor and weapons type, are you? Wait a minute... Is that a fourth round medal?! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you. With this award, you deserve the best. Take this pass in the back. Marrok will outfit you well.~ /*I'm sorry, I didn't mean to insult you. If you have that, you deserve the best. Take this ward for the backroom. Marrok will get you the good stuff.*/
@15 = ~Of course, it's not like you'd really know. I mean, I might have a special store of things for a true fighting <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but you ain't one.~
@16 = ~Times are too hard to limit your sales like that. Come on.~
@17 = ~NP: Well, that's true. Marrok doesn't like to sell first-class merchandise to people who don't even know what to do with it. But business is business. Take the pebble. It's a pass to the back room. That's where Marrok makes all the good stuff. He'll take care of you.~ /*Well, I guess you're right. Marrok doesn't like selling premium items to people he's not sure know how to take care of them, but business is business.*/
@18 = ~I'm sorry, but I'm just not convinced that you would properly take care of our high-end products. My smith is very protective of his work, you see.~
