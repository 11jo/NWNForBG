@0 = ~Ah, yet another young woman to chance upon the skills of a gnome in his prime!~ [NWERB058]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~You're one of the brothel's men?~
@3 = ~Me wants hire you.~
@4 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~NP: My name is Erb Jansen, descendant of the Jansens of Calver... But that branch are actually exiles from the Jansen clan of Thunder Mountain, so I shouldn't boast about that. It's a whole story though - how my family moved to Culver. You couldn't find a piece of turnip along the way, let me tell you. But even more remarkable is how I ended up in this job, because I used to be a trunk expert.~ /*Still, it's quite a tale how my family made its terrible trek all the way to Culver. Nary a turnip to be found on that trip, let me tell you. Even more remarkable is how I ended up in this job, considering my former career as a chest connoisseur.*/
@7 = ~A... chest connoisseur?~
@8 = ~I've never heard of a place called Culver.~
@9 = ~Do you know what's going on in Luskan?~
@10 = ~I'm looking for work, if you know of any.~
@11 = ~NP: Of course I am! An expert at entertaining the ladies. Ever since that fateful day when Miss Bela spotted a young, naive dwarf coming to this fair city with a backpack of turnips over his shoulders. At first I thought I was here as a guest.... And a very welcome one, I must say... Although the tips seemed a little strange to me. But it's been a great job. My business is doing much better than Uncle Fedard Jansen's.~ /*At first I thought I was only a guest, here... a well-treated one, I might add... although the tips struck me as a bit odd. Overall it's been a fine job. I'm far better off than Uncle Fedard Jansen ever was.*/
@12 = ~Uncle Fedard who?~
@13 = ~Oh, really? That'd be a first for this young gnome. Tempting as the offer might be, I'm too upset to take on any new clients at the moment.~
@14 = ~Upset about what?~
@15 = ~I suppose there's some time before my wine is refreshed. Go ahead and ask.~
@16 = ~I want to ask you again about getting the ring for you.~
@17 = ~Farewell, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>. May fortune smile upon you always.~
@18 = ~NP: Ah, yes, that was the golden age! Making good chests was once considered a noble profession. They were works of art, not like today's stuff that any thieving cretin can open. I'm not implying anything, don't get any ideas. Like any young dwarf from Calver, I thought only of beautiful chests and how to make a living with them. Alas, it didn't work out. Now I have to entertain women.~ /*Ah, yes, those were the days, weren't they? The making of proper chests was once a noble profession. They were pieces of art, I tell you, and not these flimsy things they make today that any two-bit <PRO_RACE> thief with half a mind could pick. Not that I'm insinuating anything.*/
@19 = ~NP: Of course, after the great Turnip Harvest debacle of '45, there's no Culver's.~ /*Well, of course not. Since the great Turnip Famine of '45, there hasn't been a Culver.*/
@20 = ~I see. Everyone died, then?~
@21 = ~I know that the military leaders of the city, those High Captains, are all trying to kill each other and take over. Beyond that I haven't a clue... I'm not the most political gnome this side of the Anauroch, you know.~
@22 = ~Perhaps it's just my overwhelming sense of deja vu, but I could have sworn I'd already given you a job. My ring, remember? Or had you already forgotten?~
@23 = ~That's what they all say, these days. I told him that winged contraption would never fly. For all I know, he's still at the bottom of that canyon.~
@24 = ~I already told you that story, I'm pretty sure... and you agreed to get the ring back for me. Or have you forgotten?~
@25 = ~Oh? Go ahead, then.~
@26 = ~Why do you need the ring?~
@27 = ~Tell me again where I can find Lady Jadale.~
@28 = ~Isn't this stealing?~
@29 = ~Maybe I could ask you something else.~
@30 = ~Okay, I'll do it.~
@31 = ~No, I'm not interested.~
@32 = ~Do come back to me once you've found that ring, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll be looking forward to it.~
@33 = ~NP: Of course not! It would have been a very unpleasant story. Everyone was very hungry and really *thought* they were going to die. Long journeys without a supply of turnips are very dangerous. No, no, it was evil Uncle Pinto who sold the license to some man for a sack of turnips in a fit of greed. They came along and renamed it 'Waterdeep' or some other nonsense.~ /*No, no, it was the much-maligned Uncle Pinto who sold the rights to some human for a sack of turnips in one of his craving fits. They went and re-named it to 'Waterdeep' or some nonsense, last I heard.*/
@34 = ~That's quite a story.~
@35 = ~I doubt that's true.~
@36 = ~Something else you wanted?~
@37 = ~There's not much more for me to say. My apologies... I'm usually more talkative, it's just that I'm so upset right now.~
@38 = ~Why are you so upset?~
@39 = ~Well, now, call me a halfling... but I actually have a job you could do for me. A little errand that is a mite dangerous to perform with the streets the way they are.~
@40 = ~Tell me about the job.~
@41 = ~NP: How do I explain this? Well. one of my clients, a beautiful noble lady named Lady Jedale, has something that belongs to me. I mean, it actually belongs to her now that she has it... But I want it back. It's a ring, a little present from me, with my name engraved on it. Take it away from her and put it in my hands, I'll be the happiest gnome on earth.~ /*How shall I explain this? Well... one of my clients, a handsome noblewoman by the name of Lady Jadale, has something that belongs to me. Technically I suppose it belongs to her, since I gave it to her... but I want it back.*/
@42 = ~I have the ring right here.~
@43 = ~Can't you just buy it from her?~
@44 = ~NP: Ha ha. you know. This gift was made under the influence of the moment. Lady Jedale's husband is a very powerful man, I should never have forgotten that, but I forgot in the heat of passion. When Lord Jedale returns, his wife must not have my ring. He is famous for his hard temper, and I am very fond of my legs, short as they are.~ /*Heh heh... well, you see... the gift was a bit of impetuousness on my part. Lady Jadale's husband is a rather powerful man, a fact I forgot at the height of passion.*/
@45 = ~You'll find her in her home on the north side of the district. Remember... don't hurt her, if you can avoid it. She's human, so it's really not her fault she's short a few marbles.~
@46 = ~Not necessarily. The ring was a gift, and I'm just being rude. It's a matter of life and death, though, so I'm okay with that.~
@47 = ~NP: Tell me where to find Lady Jedale.~ /*Tell me again where I can find Lady Jadale.*/
@48 = ~NP: Didn't you? Of course, my relatives kicked Uncle Pinto out of town for such foolishness. They thought they should have asked for at least two sacks. So, uh. Is there anything else you wanted?~ /*Isn't it? Of course my relatives drove Uncle Pinto out of town for such foolishness. They thought two sacks should have been the minimum.*/
@49 = ~NP: Of course, there was also gold... But Uncle Pinto always talked only about turnips. But the next year we had a huge harvest, and he was reviled for the deal. What a shame, though. So, uh. Is there anything else you wanted?~ /*Well, some gold may have been involved... but all Uncle Pinto ever talked about was the turnips. Considering the bumper crop we had next year, he took a lot of flak for that trade. Pity.*/
@50 = ~How did you ever manage to convince the woman to give it up? Nevermind... I probably don't want to know. As my blind Aunt Binny said when she married unfortunate old Uncle Bucktooth: 'ignorance is bliss.'~
@51 = ~I seem to recall some mention of a reward?~
@52 = ~NP: Don't I get a reward?~ /*Will there be a reward for this task, too?*/
@53 = ~NP: Ha! The lady was so happy when she got the gift... And very angry when she had to give it back. She says she likes the ring. Likes it a lot more than she likes me, apparently. That's why I need someone to get me the ring. She won't even talk to me right now.~ /*Hah! The Lady was overjoyed when I gave her the present... and quite angry when I asked for it back. She says she's quite fond of the ring. Fonder than she is of me, at present.*/
@54 = ~NP: Splendid! Lady Jedale is at her home, not far from here. Go north, then turn right. If you can, be polite to her. I don't want to see any harm come to this strange young lady. Otherwise they'll do me a lot of harm.~ /*Do be kind to her, though, if you can. I don't wish any harm on the dotty woman... I just don't want any harm to come my way.*/

@56 = ~All right, all right... have it your way. Jenny Janson was picky, too, and she ended up a poor spinster in a small hovel with all of three teeth to her name. The choice is yours.~
@57 = ~NP: Lady Jedale is, shall we say, not thinking of the fact that her husband will not be pleased when he finds my ring in his wife's possession. She knows less about it than elves know about shoes, so I'll say. You might want to ask a few questions before you go after my ring.~ /*The Lady Jadale is, shall we say, rather oblivious to the fact that her husband might not be too fond of me when he discovers the ring. She has less sense than an elf in a shoe store, I tell you.*/
@58 = ~I knew you were the successful type, right from the moment I laid eyes on you. "Erb," I thought, "this <PRO_MANWOMAN> could be bigger than Uncle Bigbottom!" And that's big. So here you go... 650 gold pieces for the ring.~
@59 = ~NP: You could have given more to a fellow dwarf!~ /*Surely you could spare more for a fellow gnome?*/
@60 = ~It wasn't easy to get this, you know. I think you could spare a little more.~
@61 = ~You better cough up some more coin or you won't even live long enough to regret it!~
@62 = ~Thanks - it's been a pleasure doing business with you.~
@63 = ~Yes, of course! I did say that, didn't I? Never let it be said that Erb reneged on a promise... unlike my poor, deranged and thrice-married Aunt Fanny. Hmmm... where was I? Oh, yes. Here's 500 gold pieces for the ring.~
@64 = ~I must admit, I didn't have a good feeling about this when we started... sort of like when you swallow a copper piece by accident. The whole thing had trouble going down. But here we are and nobody's choking! How would 350 gold pieces sound?~
@65 = ~NP: I guess looking at me, everyone seems to think we dwarves are much luckier than everyone else. Well, all right. Here's another 100 coins for your trouble. Don't spend it all in one place. Now, I need to go away for a while, in case Lady Jedale decides to come looking for me, or worse. It's a good thing dwarves are so short and can hide so well. Goodbye, my friend!~ /*And now I must take my leave for a brief while, in case Lady Jadale tries to look me up or worse. It's really a good thing gnomes are short and easy to hide. Farewell, my friend!*/

@67 = ~NP: Perhaps you do deserve a little more. I can imagine how unpleasant it was to deal with Lady Jedale. If you make her angry, she's worse than a griffin that's had its tail feathers ripped out. Here's another 100 coins. Now, I need to get away for a while, in case Lady Jedale decides to come looking for me, or worse. It's a good thing dwarves are so short and good at hiding. Goodbye, my friend!~ /*I suppose you probably do deserve something extra. I don't imagine Lady Jadale was all that pleasant to deal with. When she gets excited she's a bit pluckier than a griffon without its tail feathers. Here's another 100 gp.*/
@68 = ~It's sweet of you to try and swindle me, but the reward is worth far more than the ring already.~
@69 = ~NP: Now, now, now, calm down. There's no need to get so angry. You don't have to use force and show resentment. Here, I have another 100 coins. Take it, it's yours. But that's all I have. Now, I must go away for a while, in case Lady Jedale comes looking for me, or worse. It's a very good thing dwarfs are so short and can hide so well. Goodbye, my friend!~ /*And now I must take my leave for a brief while, in case Lady Jadale tries to look me up or worse. It's really a good thing gnomes are short and easy to hide. Farewell, my friend!*/
@70 = ~And now I must take my leave for a brief while, in case Lady Jadale tries to look me up or worse. It's really a good thing gnomes are short and easy to hide. Farewell, my friend!~
@71 = ~Why, hello there my pretty little peach. You certainly don't strike me as the normal variety of crone I've become accustomed to servicing. Who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth, though, eh?~ [NWERB057]
@72 = ~Hmmm. I see the streets of Luskan are scraping the bottom of the barrel again when it comes to the availability of women in search of a good gnome. No matter! I've taken on more difficult jobs in my lifetime, let me tell you!~ [NWERB059]
@73 = ~Are you insulting me?~
@74 = ~Naturally not. My charm is such that even the prettiest of ladies seek me out... so you're not to blame for wanting quality merchandise.~
@75 = ~I'm asking myself: is this lad here for a conversation or does he have some gnome-fetish that I dare not even ask about? I'm hoping for the former, but being a quality gnome like myself, anything is possible.~ [NWERB056]
@76 = ~Back again, are you? They all come back to me eventually... even the bounty hunters, though we won't get into that.~ [NWERB055]
@77 = ~You mentioned something about a job before.~
@78 = ~How sweet. You've come back to bask in the glow of gnome in his prime, have you?~ [NWERB054]
@79 = ~How goes the search? Tell me you have the ring... my third toe has been itching like mad, and that means all this fighting could stop at any second.~ [NWERB053]
@80 = ~I really must be going... there's a bread box down in Mirabar with my name on it.~ [NWERB052]
