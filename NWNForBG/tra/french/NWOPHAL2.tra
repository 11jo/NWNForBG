@0 = ~These are strange times, my <LADYLORD>. The beds in the Moonstone Mask being filled by wounded soldiers. Who could have imagined?~ [NWOPHA54]
@1 = ~I have need of your services.~
@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~Didn't this place used to be a brothel?~
@4 = ~Bye bye.~
@5 = ~Well, I'm afraid most of the Moonstone Mask's services are unavailable. My staff are busy tending to the wounded and the beds are filled with the dead and dying. Hardly sets the proper mood for romance. However, if you're interested in purchasing supplies for some clandestine operation I can still help you out.~ 
@6 = ~Yes, let me see what you have in stock.~
@7 = ~No time for questions. We're swamped! I've never seen so many men and women flat on their backs. Well, not from injuries, anyway.~
@8 = ~The Moonstone Mask was known for the... comforts... we gave our customers. But there are many wounded, the temple is full and we have more beds than anywhere else in town. Is it really so strange that in these troubled times we're willing to provide a more conventional kind of comfort for the wounded of Neverwinter?~ 
@9 = ~Off with you then. I'm too busy to say a long goodbye.~
@10 = ~I can use your gold to buy more bandages and clean sheets. The ones we have are a little bloodstained, you know.~
@11 = ~And Luce is no help. Used to be one of my best girls, but ever since she was reunited with her little sister she spends all her time doting on that girl.~
@12 = ~And Luce is no help. Used to be one of my best girls, but ever since her little sister disappeared she does nothing but mope in the corner.~
