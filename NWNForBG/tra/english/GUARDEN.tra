@0 = ~I am returned to preserve the heart of this place. The demon who suppressed me is banished, and I am free.~
@1 = ~NP: You have allowed Helm's will to return, but your very being is tainted with evil. With such allies, one must be careful. I offer help: an enchanted ring, a masterfully crafted bow, or Helm's power to help you.~ /*You have allowed the will of Helm to return, yet your nature is tainted by evil. We shall be cautious allies.*/
@2 = ~I want the magic item.~
@3 = ~I will take the weapon.~
@4 = ~Grant the power of Helm to aid me.~
@5 = ~NP: I don't need anything from you.~ /*"I don't want anything from you."*/
@6 = ~NP: You did as your conscience told you and allowed Helm's will to return. Your intentions are pure. I will give you something special: an enchanted ring, a masterfully crafted bow, Helm's help, or my intuition to know what will happen.~ /*To you I grant something extra: A enchanted ring, an expertly crafted bow, the aid of Helm, or my insight of what comes.*/
@7 = ~Grant me your insight.~
@8 = ~NP: Your nature is unrecognizable. Are you acting in the name of harmony, or just on a whim? I will be your careful ally. I offer help: an enchanted ring, a masterfully crafted bow, or Helm's power to help you.~ /*Your nature is indeterminate. Are you aiding the balance, or merely acting on a whim? I am your cautious ally.*/
@9 = ~NP: Accept these gifts of Helm. Use them for protection and for your duty. Few receive such an award. I need to go somewhere else and prepare for the coming darkness. Go ahead and do what needs to be done.~ /*I must go elsewhere, and fortify against the coming darkness. Go forth, and do what must be done.*/
@10 = ~NP: It is your right to refuse the gifts I have offered. I canâ€™t say that I approve of this choice, but this is not my fight. I need to go somewhere else and prepare for the coming darkness. Go ahead and do what needs to be done.~ /*I must go elsewhere, and fortify against the coming darkness. Go forth, and do what must be done.*/
@11 = ~You seek guidance from the divine. That shows a presence of mind I find lacking in many. Ask and I shall answer.~
@12 = ~Where is my enemy?~
@13 = ~Who is Desther's master?~
@14 = ~Why was Neverwinter attacked?~
@15 = ~How do I bring peace to the world?~
@16 = ~NP: This is a very broad question. Dester is here, and it's not difficult to find him at all. But those who stand behind him are hidden, unknown and incomprehensible. I see a lot of evil sown by hatred, but its foundations are unknown to me. I do not see the origins, but I fear what may follow.~ /*I see layers of evil, seeded with hate, but the foundation is unknown. I can't see the beginning, but I fear what may come.*/
@17 = ~Maybe you answer more questions?~
@18 = ~NP: Fear, anger, desire. He is the slave of all this. The master he served ceased to be his master. Dester was abandoned, now he is useless. Now he resists fate. The power he contacted is very strange. She's ancient, I don't see the hand that guides her.~ /*Fear, anger, desire. He is a slave to each of these. The master that commanded him is no longer his master. Desther is abandoned, his usefulness at an end.*/
@19 = ~NP: The plague became an offensive weapon only after it was released. It was not Dester who started it, although he distributed it and did not allow a cure to be found. Howling Death afflicted the spirit, causing the body to rot around the soul. The very essence of the victim was dying, as were the hopes of everyone else. But this matter did not disappear. Someone or something is enriched as a result of other people's losses. The plague fed its master.~ /*The plague became an attack only after being unleashed. Desther did not start it, but he did spread it and delayed the cure.*/
@20 = ~NP: I have seen many roads paved with such dreams. Unfortunately, not all travelers came to where they went. As already stated, I believe that if we destroy what threatens Neverwinter, then a time will come much more peaceful than now. In a general sense, making peace means satisfying the needs - or destroying - of each and every one.~ /*That said, I imagine destroying whatever threatens Neverwinter will bring a great deal more peace than exists currently.*/
@21 = ~NP: I can't. Such predictions are debilitating. I hope this has been of some use. There is almost nothing else I can do. But you are so virtuous that you will receive another gift. Treat it with due respect, for it is a true blessing. I need to go somewhere else and prepare for the coming darkness. Go ahead and do what needs to be done.~ /*But such is your purity that you will receive a further boon. Accept this not lightly, for you have recieved a true blessing.*/
@22 = ~I have no true answer as to why. I cannot see. That worries me. It worries me.~
@23 = ~If I thought you were capable of this, the fight ahead of you would be altogether different and, likely, against me.~
