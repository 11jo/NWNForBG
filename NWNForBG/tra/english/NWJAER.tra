@0 = ~There is nothing like living in dangerous times to test one's strength of heart! Do you agree, stranger?~
@1 = ~Yes! I challenge fate daily to prove myself worthy.~
@2 = ~Uh... sure. I guess you like to fight?~
@3 = ~NP: I think the best thing for me would be to live in quiet, peaceful times.~ /*Actually, I think I would rather live in a nice, peaceful age.*/
@4 = ~Excellent! I will buy you a drink later, when I am not on duty. Of course, in the defense of nature, I am always on duty. Ha! Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ /*Excellent! I will buy you a drink later, when I am not on duty. Of course, in the defense of nature, I am always on duty. Ha!*/
@5 = ~What's going on here?~
@6 = ~What do you do here?~
@7 = ~NP: I guess that's okay. Goodbye.~ /*Nothing more. Goodbye.*/
@8 = ~It is the responsibility of one who follows nature. The strong survive and the only way to become stronger is to pit yourself against worthy adversaries. Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ /*It is the responsibility of one who follows nature. The strong survive and the only way to become stronger is to pit yourself against worthy adversaries.*/
@9 = ~Bah! And what price comes with peace? Weakness! Life gets easy, people get fat and lazy, then someone with real strength comes along and takes everything. That's how nature works. Do you really think that everything can be solved by sitting around and hoping problems will just go away?~ /*Bah! And what price comes with peace? Weakness! Life gets easy, people get fat and lazy, then someone with real strength comes along and takes everything. That's how nature works.*/
@10 = ~No. There is a time for fighting and a time for talking, but a wise person knows the difference.~
@11 = ~There is very little that one cannot accomplish using the mind instead of the body.~
@12 = ~It's small-minded people like you who cause war and destruction in the world.~
@13 = ~You keep getting in my face and I'll show you how the strong survive!~
@14 = ~Well, because of you, everything has pretty much returned to normal around here. Anything else?~
@15 = ~Everyone is working hard to recover from the death of the Spirit. It will be a long haul, but it's a battle worth fighting. Anything else?~
@16 = ~Right now, the latest fight facing us is with the Spirit of the Wood. It is driving the animals to attack everyone and everything in an insane fashion. There is no pleasure in slaughtering maddened animals. I suggest you go and talk to Aawill about it, if you want to help. He's in charge of the investigation. I have enough to do around here.~ /*Right now, the latest fight facing us is with the Spirit of the Wood. It is driving the animals to attack everyone and everything in an insane fashion. There is no pleasure in slaughtering maddened animals.*/
@17 = ~All right. Goodbye.~
@18 = ~I am in charge of the druid circle challenges. When a druid wants to become a member of our grove, he or she must challenge one of our members to gain entry to the first circle.~
@19 = ~Can I challenge one of the druids?~
@20 = ~Go and test yourself against a worthy opponent. It will stiffen your spine and make you stronger.~
@21 = ~Challenging the mind is a part of growth. But do not forget: strong of body, strong of mind, they work together to form the perfect whole. Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ /*Challenging the mind is a part of growth. But do not forget: strong of body, strong of mind, they work together to form the perfect whole.*/
@22 = ~NP: And on that line, I think this conversation is over. Come back when you decide to change your mind. Good-bye.~ /*And on that note, I think this conversation is over. Come back when you decide to join the rest of us in reality. Goodbye.*/
@23 = ~Excellent! You prove my point through your actions. I was worried that you might be one of those foolish and weak pacifists! Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ /*Excellent! You prove my point through your actions. I was worried that you might be one of those foolish and weak pacifists!*/
@24 = ~NP: While I respect your desire, only a druid from our forest can challenge and enter the circle. You're an adventurer, aren't you? One day you're here, the next day you're gone. Farewell.~ /*While I respect your desire, only a druid may challenge and become a member. If you were to learn the ways of the druid and return, then you could prove yourself.*/
@25 = ~I see you are back. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@26 = ~NP: Have you decided to help our forest? A glorious battle awaits you. May Silvanus be with you.~ /*Better safe than sorry. Have a potion, then, and Tyr be with you.*/
@27 = ~NP: Well, thanks to you, things are back to more or less normal. That must have been quite a battle!~ /*Well, because of you, everything has pretty much returned to normal around here. Anything else?*/
@28 = ~NP: We are doing our best to recover from the death of the Spirit. It will take a long time, but this battle is worth it.~ /*Everyone is working hard to recover from the death of the Spirit. It will be a long haul, but it's a battle worth fighting. Anything else?*/
