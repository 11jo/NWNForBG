@0 = ~First the Wailing Death and now the Luskan invaders... it seems like Neverwinter is cursed!~
@1 = ~The soldiers who survived the fighting in the southern section of the city are saying the Luskanites don't take prisoners! They'll kill us all when they get here!~
@2 = ~You're the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come here to save the city one last time, or are you trapped here like the rest of us?~
@3 = ~The soldiers won't be able to hold the city core much longer. Soon the enemy will break through and slaughter us all!~
