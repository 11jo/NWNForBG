@0 = ~The Wailing's caused its fair share of conflict beyond these gates, <GIRLBOY>, making it a dangerous place. Lady Aribeth has ordered us to restrict access. In other words, if you want access to the Blacklake district, you're going to need quarantine clearance, understood?~ /*The Wailing's caused its fair share of conflict beyond these gates, <GIRLBOY>, making it a dangerous place. Lady Aribeth has ordered us to restrict access.*/
@1 = ~Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.~
@2 = ~What kind of clearance do I need?~
@3 = ~Why do I need clearance?~
@4 = ~Sorry, no.~
@5 = ~Aye, there was word she'd be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?~
@6 = ~Could you answer some questions about the Blacklake district?~
@7 = ~NP: I have a few general questions.~ /*I have some questions.*/
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~We're under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you'll have to remain in the Core.~
@10 = ~Look, the Wailing Death isn't a joke. I don't even want to think of the number of dead. I heard Lord Nasher has even come down with it. We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.~ /*We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.*/
@11 = ~Then don't waste my time.~
@12 = ~I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.~
@13 = ~Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~What do you know of the Wailing Death?~
@15 = ~Are you familiar with Lady Aribeth?~
@16 = ~Be careful. There's plenty of danger afoot.~
@17 = ~Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages. He had the symbol of Helm, god of all us guard-folk, gripped tightly in his frozen palm. We buried him with it that way... to honor him.~ /*Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages.*/
@18 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@19 = ~Do you know anything else about what happened that night?~
@20 = ~Too little to cure it, too much to live without fear. Our only hope is to find those Waterdhavian creatures. Without them, every last one of us is dead.~
@21 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?~
@22 = ~I'm interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.~
@23 = ~Can't say I know her as well as Abbot Fenthick, har har! But, aye, she has been a pillar of this community since she was knighted.~
@24 = ~Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?~
@25 = ~Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?~
@26 = ~The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search.*/
@27 = ~NP: I have a few questions about the Black Lake area?~ /*I have some questions about the Docks district.*/
@28 = ~The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all.*/
@29 = ~You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck.*/
@30 = ~Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory.*/
@31 = ~If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know... Might there be something else you need?~ /*If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know...*/
@32 = ~I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this.*/
@33 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
@34 = ~Is there any way I can help out in there?~
@35 = ~How bad is it in there?~
@36 = ~NP: Are there any places I should visit in the Black Lake area?~ /*Are there any places I should look out for in the Peninsula district?*/
@37 = ~Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?~
@38 = ~I don't know if there's that much left to do. There was some trouble with someone named Meldanen and his cache of grain, but that's over now. If you've got other business in there you are welcome to go, but I think it's pretty quiet now, for the most part. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*I don't know if there's that much left to do. There was some trouble with someone named Meldanen and his cache of grain, but that's over now.*/
@39 = ~NP: Well, your best bet is to talk to the guards. On the other side stands the gatekeeper of the Black Lake. Maybe he can tell you how you can get in or out. Be careful. There is a burned-out quarter between us and Chernozerye itself. It's full of plague-crazed thugs. In Chernozerye itself it is quiet and smooth, but on the burnt-out street it is dangerous, as in hell. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Be careful on the way in, though. There's a burned-out bit of the city between here and the Blacklake proper. Nothing but plague-crazed thugs in there. Blacklake is fine, but the first bit is dangerous as hell.*/
@40 = ~No worse than anywhere else, now. There was some trouble with one of the nobles keeping a cache of food away from everyone else, but he's been dealt with. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*No worse than anywhere else, now. There was some trouble with one of the nobles keeping a cache of food away from everyone else, but he's been dealt with.*/
@41 = ~Well, the Blacklake's split into two parts - the Nobles' Quarter, and the rest of it. The nobles are plague-free right now and sealed off tight. There's rumors the nobles have a cure that they aren't willing to share with the rest of us. I doubt it's true, but food attracts flies - victims of the Wailing have been flocking to the Blacklake barricades. There've been a few clashes already, so tread carefully. It especially dangerous between this gate and Blacklake proper. Not much besides plague-crazed thugs in that part. Dangerous as hell.~ /*Well, the Blacklake's split into two parts - the Nobles' Quarter, and the rest of it. The nobles are plague-free right now and sealed off tight. There's rumors the nobles have a cure that they aren't willing to share with the rest of us.*/
@42 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Peninsula district?~
@43 = ~The Nobles' Quarter itself is all barricaded in, but being a guard gives you access. Once inside you can check out the zoo in the north and a rough-house tavern called the Board Laid Bare in the centre of the district, if you want.

Once inside you can check out the zoo in the north and a rough-house tavern called the Board Laid Bare in the centre of the district, if you want.*/
@44 = ~NP: Because of the Howling Death, a terrible conflict broke out outside this gate, so it is now very dangerous there. Lady Aribeth has ordered us to restrict access, but you may pass.~ /*The Wailing's caused its fair share of conflict beyond these gates, <GIRLBOY>, making it a dangerous place. Lady Aribeth has ordered us to restrict access.*/
@45 = ~NP: Because of the Howling Death, a terrible conflict erupted outside this gate. There was a problem with one magician named Meldanen, who accumulated a lot of grain, but he was already dealt with. If you still have business there, come in, but everything is already calm there.~ /*I don't know if there's that much left to do. There was some trouble with someone named Meldanen and his cache of grain, but that's over now.*/
