@0 = ~Alhelor, Port Llast's only Anti-Lycanthropic Merchant, at your service! Come one, come all - defend yourself against the legend of the Black Wolf! Ha!~ [NWALH053]
@1 = ~Tell me what you know of this Black Wolf.~
@2 = ~Anti-lycanthropic goods? Is that what you sell here?~
@3 = ~Can I buy some anti-lycanthropic goods from you?~
@4 = ~I would like to ask you a few questions.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~Ahhh, now that is a story, indeed. The Black Wolf is a legend in these parts: a powerful werewolf who has been about for many years, stealing children and slaying lone travelers.~
@7 = ~He is a legend no longer, however. Ander, here, is the sole survivor of a band of hunters who encountered the Black Wolf in the flesh... and lost!~
@8 = ~How are you involved in all this?~
@9 = ~I'd like to hear more about this encounter.~
@10 = ~Why, yes. The best that you'll find for slaying werewolves, such as the Black Wolf. The more werewolves that are slain, the closer we come to realizing their eradication.~
@11 = ~I'd know if your goods worked well with a free sample.~
@12 = ~Why are you so dedicated to eradicating werewolves?~
@13 = ~Of course, let me show you what I have.~
@14 = ~Yes, of course. But let us not take up too much time with talk, for business has been quite strong, lately. Everyone's worried about the Black Wolf!~
@15 = ~Do you know of any rumors in town?~
@16 = ~Have you any jobs that I might perform?~
@17 = ~Perhaps you could help me with directions.~
@18 = ~Yes, and farewell to you. Keep to yourself and you'll be safer for it.~
@19 = ~Well, I have no direct part in the tale, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I travel wherever tales of lycanthropes abound, hoping my goods will aid in their destruction.~
@20 = ~You would be better off asking young Ander. He could tell you first-hand what I could only collect from discussions.~
@21 = ~Neurik sent me here to get some equipment.~
@22 = ~I'm sorry, but this is a business and my reputation is impeccable. If you're going to hunt werewolves, you'll need to buy the supplies.~
@23 = ~Why shouldn't I be? Are they not destructive, unnatural beasts? Do they not corrupt human beings with their disease? This Black Wolf, alone, has been a terrible scourge to Port Llast.~
@24 = ~But why would you focus on werewolves alone?~
@25 = ~Truly, there's a rumor alive within these very walls. We've the young Ander, here. He and his band traveled out with the brave fool Sir Karathis to slay the Black Wolf. But of that expedition, only Ander here lives to tell the tale. The rest are cursed to howl forever at the moon!~ /*Truly, there's a rumor alive within these very walls. We've the young Ander, here. He and his band traveled out with the brave fool Sir Karathis to slay the Black Wolf.*/
@26 = ~Can I ask about that expedition? About Sir Karathis?~
@27 = ~Jobs are scare to come by. I have enough work for myself and Ander, here, but little else to dole out to those in need. For that, I am sorry.~
@28 = ~I have not lived within Port Llast for very long... I came here only once I heard the tales of the Black Wolf, after all. Perhaps young Ender can help you find what you need, eh?~ 
@29 = ~Ah, good of Neurik that. You can never be too prepared when going up against werewolves. Would you like to buy something?~
@30 = ~Yeah, show me.~
@31 = ~Need I explain my every action to you? These creatures are formidable beasts... and the common people must be armed to fight them! Making a profit is the least of my worries. You don't need to know anything else. I've presented my arguments, you give me some peace.~ 
@32 = ~You have a keen nose to have tracked me here. I suppose I should welcome you to my den...~ [NWALH054]
@33 = ~If you're the Black Wolf, why did you run that store?~
@34 = ~Why all this deceit, "Black Wolf?" What was in it for you?~
@35 = ~Care to barter for your life, betrayer?~
@36 = ~Trickery! Prepare to die, Black Wolf!~ 
@37 = ~It was required to throw the trail away from me. A stranger, come from out of town to offer assistance? What better disguise than this? Plus it gave me the chance to develop a slow resistance to wolfbane.~
@38 = ~We wolves are predators. It was simply time to hunt the hunter and pin my crimes upon my prey. I had played possum with Karathis long enough...~
@39 = ~You show cunning. I like that... a simple tooth to prove my death and we both walk out of here alive?~
@40 = ~That sounds fair.~
@41 = ~Sorry, I'm not interested.~
@42 = ~I am an old and cunning wolf, my friend - not one to die so easily.~
@43 = ~As always, it is a pleasure doing business with you.~
@44 = ~More questions, then? Curiosity killed the cat, remember...~
@45 = ~Mind the place, will you Ander? I am an old man, grown tired, and I should go home to catch my rest.~ [NWALH051]
@46 = ~And he does a fine job of it, too. You just talk to me if you need anything to fight a werewolf like the one that shook up ol' Ander here.~
@47 = ~What's this about a werewolf?~
