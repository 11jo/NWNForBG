@0 = ~MT: There is always talk about the underground business in our institution. They say we hold gladiator fights and use slaves, do not believe it, all warriors fight voluntarily.~ /*You'd have to be an exceptional specimen for that to work on me. You're an amateur compared to my men in the back.*/
@1 = ~MT: Ask anyone you want, anyone will tell you that the sorcerer Meldanen used portals in his youth to quietly drag his girls home to him.~ /*This is an entrance portal that Halaster uses to trap creatures in Undermountain.*/
@2 = ~MT: They say some druid from the city center came to our zoo and demanded to release the animals. So the owner of the zoo, Montgomery, ordered his guards to drive him in three necks.~ /*Please, use the fetish I made to lead the animals to freedom. There is no point to their captivity. They don't need to suffer.*/
@3 = ~MT: They say some heroes were not afraid of Montgomery himself and freed all the animals from the zoo.~ /*Tell me why you wanted your freedom from Tymofarrar.*/
@4 = ~MT: Recently, people have seen a dryad roaming the area. So, there are rumors that Meldanen himself dragged her to his mansion.~ /*Be careful... everyone's talking about the werewolves in these parts.*/
@5 = ~MT: Rumor has it that the sorcerer Meldanen dragged a dryad into his mansion and forcibly held her. So some heroes were not afraid of the sorcerer and slapped him in the impudent muzzle.~ /*Rumor is that Luskan's sealed its gates to anyone comin' in. Some figger they came down wit' the Wailing but I thinks different.*/
@6 = ~MT: They say that in one of the houses in our area there is a secret passage to the ancient graves, but I do not believe this.~ /*They say that Meldanen keeps a strange lot o' creatures in his estate, though, and I don't doubt it none.*/
@7 = ~MT: It turns out that the owners of the estates Hodge and Rambottom have annoyed Lady Ofala with something, and now she wants revenge.~ /*It turns out that Ophala was interested in acquiring the gilded urn, among other things.*/
@8 = ~MT: Speak to Formosa in the square by the fountain if you are looking for adventure here, although of course this may be your last adventure. Fighting Meldanen himself is not for everyone.~ /*From what I've heard, the Docks district is almost settled down, even with the plague still a concern for most.*/
@9 = ~MT: It was not in vain that Formosa gathered people in the square. Someone dealt with this sorcerer Meldanen, who kept the whole area in fear.~ /*I shall have to see about dealing with the sorcerer, himself, then. Meldanen will not get away with this!*/
@10 = ~MT: Well, Formosa jumped. She called on people to deal with Meldanen, and now she herself is dead.~ /*All right. I hate to part with it for only 500 gp, though...*/
