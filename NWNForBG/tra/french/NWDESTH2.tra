@0 = ~Well, hello <CHARNAME>. I imagine you are well pleased with yourself? This is your doing, after all.~ [NWDES120]
@1 = ~Just happy to help. We all sought a cure in our own way.~
@2 = ~Me just a hero. Heroes do stuff like this.~
@3 = ~I did more than you can claim. I got results.~
@4 = ~Really, Fenthick, now is not the time for such talk. Others will not understand like you do.~
@5 = ~Perhaps, although it was definitely your thuggish actions that brought us to this point. You outstepped my Helmite brethren very effectively. Bravo. Of course, now it is time for you to step aside. The ritual will not require you. You may watch as we create the plague cure, but do not interfere.~
@6 = ~Why did you have Fentick reveal the secret of Castle Nevers' defense?~ 
@7 = ~I have questions about the ritual.~
@8 = ~What will you do after the plague is cured?~
@9 = ~I have questions about the region.~
@10 = ~Goodbye.~
@11 = ~I'm sure. You made my Helmite brethren look quite ineffective by comparison. The importance of what we were trying to do was called into question. Of course, now it is time for you to step aside. The ritual will not require you. You may watch as we create the plague cure, but do not interfere.~ 
@12 = ~Oh, I don't question your results, but I hoped to have more of a say in the outcome. My Helmite brethren and I have a lot invested in this. Of course, now it is time for you to step aside. The ritual will not require you. You may watch as we create the plague cure, but do not interfere.~ 
@13 = ~That is my affair. I explained my need to Fenthick and he saw the wisdom in it. Getting the proper result from the ritual requires a certain amount of risk.~
@14 = ~Magical risk, or tempting the wrath of Aribeth?~
@15 = ~Then I suggest you study magic for a few more years. You are not a part of the spell, so I see no point in having you mimic the incantations. We will invoke energy both arcane and divine, and when we are done there will be a cure for the plague. That is all you need to know.~ 
@16 = ~With a cure in hand, my reason for being in Neverwinter will be gone. I will be returning to Helm's Hold for a time. Beyond that is my own affair.~
@17 = ~My interest in these people is shrinking as we near the end of the plague. You would do better to speak with them yourself.~
@18 = ~Very well. I believe it is time for us to proceed. Let the ritual commence!~
@19 = ~Yes, let me concentrate on the ritual to come. Goodbye, <CHARNAME>. I'm sure you are proud of all you have done. You should speak with each of the others before we begin the ritual. They will likely want to congratulate you. Very important, I'm sure.~ 
@20 = ~Well, that is certainly part of it. Aribeth dislikes me, and it makes her difficult to deal with. I'm not sure what Fenthick sees in her, really. I doubt she can provide a real proven reason for her distrust. Fenthick is more understanding. He knows that faith is a powerful tool.~
@21 = ~Greetings again. I can spare a moment, but we should begin the ritual as soon as you speak with everyone else. With my help, Desther will... well... it isn't important.~ [NWDES144]
