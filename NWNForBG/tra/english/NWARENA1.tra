@0 = ~What? Why would I talk to you? You've got no medals. Feh!~
@1 = ~At least tell me about the fighters.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~NP: A beginner wants to know about the fighters? Ha! And why? To get the title, you first need to defeat the mighty Hrask - only then will you be appreciated! Hrask has a fire axe, you know? Burn all your hair. Even the shortest!~ /*A newcomer wants to know about the fighters? HA! Like it matters! You'd have to beat the mighty Hrusk and his pet before you're even ranked!*/
@4 = ~What about the others?~
@5 = ~That's right, goodbye. As if I've got time for no-medals like you. Beat it.~
@6 = ~Go away. I'm done talking to your worthless butt.~
@7 = ~Hey there! You are doing pretty good! You got a good medal on you!~
@8 = ~What do you know about the fighters?~
@9 = ~You watch a lot of the fights. Are they fair?~
@10 = ~NP: Fashi must be fought in the second round. He seems small, but remote! Just an amazing guy. You can't cut it or prick it! He is always so focused. But often he is covered in bruises. I have noticed that. He is also vulnerable.~ /*You just can't cut him or poke him. He's so focussed. He bruises though. I noticed that. He's not invulnerable.*/
@11 = ~What about the Third Round?~
@12 = ~NP: Certainly. That is, each has its own special skill, but you can learn about all this even before the battle. Ask the people. Except Claudus. He has nothing special, but he is simply impossible to beat. That's how strong he is.~ /*Oh, sure. I mean, each guy has a specialty and a pet, but that's all known before a fight begins, if you ask around.*/
@13 = ~Sure. See you. Good luck! You're great!~
@14 = ~NP: With Agar you need to fight for a medal in the third round. He is strong, he has good armor, well, like everyone else, and something else is not good. He has a poisonous weapon. At first people complained, but then they got used to it. All the same, he is strong, he is appreciated here.~ /*Agar is the Third Round Medal fight. He's real tough. He's got a pet, like everyone else, and he's got something nasty too.*/
@15 = ~What about Claudus?~
@16 = ~Don't worry about that. You won't get to him. The others are plenty tough, but Claudus is just plain scary.~
@17 = ~NP: It is you! This<CHARNAME> ! I love you! I mean, I like the way you fight! You have defeated Fashi! And Agar himself! I can't believe I'm talking to you. I mean, maybe you're used to being a rookie with no medals, but now! Just think!~ /*I can't believe I'm talking to you. I mean, sure, maybe you used to be a no-medals, but look at you now! WOW!*/
@18 = ~What do you know about Claudus?~
@19 = ~Go away, kid, you bother me.~
@20 = ~Thank you. Farewell.~
@21 = ~NP: Clodus? He is great, he is invincible! How... I don't know how anyone! It's like he's completely invincible! Some complain that he is so strong, but they are no match for him. After all, everything is fair, right? He fights with normal enchanted weapons without any gimmicks like fire or poison. He seems to be a super fighter by nature!~ /*Claudus? He's just great! It's like... I don't know! It's like he's almost invulnerable! Some people complain that he's so good, but they just can't compete.*/
@22 = ~NP: Hmm... Having received medals, he starts to turn up his nose... But how he fights... It's amazing!~ /*Me do what Kurth want... but he still no let her go.*/
@23 = ~NP: Thank you! He says thank you! To me! Did everyone hear?! Wow!~ /*Thanks! <PRO_HESHE> said thanks! To me! Everyone see that?! Damn right!*/
@24 = ~NP: Incredible!<CHARNAME> the best! The best! It was great!~ /*I can't believe it!  is just the best! The BEST! That was great!*/
