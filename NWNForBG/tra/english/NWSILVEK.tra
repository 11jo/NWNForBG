@0 = ~NP: Ooh! R-r, you're stronger. What do you want? Rrrr! Here's my throat. sink your teeth into it, it's yours.~ [WOLFF02] /*Rowf! I show my throat to you. Sink your teeth into it, it is yours...*/
@1 = ~You talk do you? Then answer my questions!~
@2 = ~Grovelling won't save your worthless hide! Die, dog!~
@3 = ~As you wish, manling...~
@4 = ~Where did you learn to talk?~
@5 = ~You've been hunting the nearby cattle, haven't you...~
@6 = ~NP: You miserable dog! I think I'll kill you after all.~ /*Whimpering dog! I've decided to kill you after all.*/
@7 = ~Grrrrr! I am no tame and addled pet! I would rather die than face your foolish insults!~
@8 = ~My mother served a manling ranger. He taught me your foolish tongue when I was still a pup.~
@9 = ~Who is this ranger?~
@10 = ~Tell me about your hunting grounds.~
@11 = ~There is more meat on them than a deer and they do not run as fast... Would you not hunt them?~
@12 = ~It sounds like coward's food...~
@13 = ~Yes but they're owned by farmers who will have you killed!~
@14 = ~NP: No one. He's dead. He sent my mom to fight a demon, and he wanted to run away. I bit him myself. It's bad to serve the human race. Rrrr, but it's worse to serve a coward.~ /*Nobody. He is dead. He sent my mother to fight a demon just so he could run away. I killed him with my own teeth.*/
@15 = ~That I face you here should be proof that I'm no coward...~
@16 = ~Fine. I want to ask you something else.~
@17 = ~NP: We used to hunt in the eastern forests, but some evil has taken hold. My wolf hunted in a human village, but the meat from the bones was rotten. When he ate that meat, he said that part of him disappeared with the meat, went to an infinite place. And then it went on again and again until he died from the inside out.~ /*When he ate it, he said it took a piece of him away with it to an endless place. And then it took more and more until he died from the inside out.*/
@18 = ~That is why I've led the pack out of the forest and to this new den... And now you come here and defile it! Grrrr...~
@19 = ~NP: Who is this tracker who taught you to speak?~ /*Who's this Oreth you mention?*/
@20 = ~Grrrrrr... I am no coward. It is you manlings that show cowardice, wearing the skins of others, relying on more than fang and claw to fight...~
@21 = ~Grrrr.... I'll make my hunting grounds where I wish! And as for manlings owning the animals, it reminds me of the ranger who taught me your foolish tongue!~
@22 = ~I will not follow you, manling, if that is what you have come to ask...~
@23 = ~Simply a favor, that's all I ask...~
@24 = ~Your courage has earned you that much. I will not follow you but you may ask something else of me...~
@25 = ~I need you to stop hunting the cattle... and no people, either!~
@26 = ~Grrrrr! I am no tame and addled pet! I would rather die than follow another manling!~
@27 = ~Rrrrr... Their flesh is the best I've tasted in many years but I will do as you ask. There are enough deer about for us to live on...~
@28 = ~NP: Rrrrrrrrr... Get out of my lair.~ [WOLFF02] /*Rrrrrrrrr... Who enters my den?*/
@29 = ~NP: Well, I'm leaving now.~ /*Nevermind, I'll go.*/
