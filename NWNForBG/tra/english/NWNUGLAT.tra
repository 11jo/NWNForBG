@0 = ~I don't recognize you. Have you come to finish what Dergiab started? No... you look more like intruders to me.~ [NWNUG050]
@1 = ~And you look more like a prisoner, to me.~
@2 = ~Who's this Dergiab you mention?~
@3 = ~You don't seem happy to see your rescuer.~
@4 = ~I could kill you, you know.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~Well, yes. That's true. I am a prisoner. Dergiab betrayed me, and threw me in here when I was no longer of use to him.~
@7 = ~I would have assumed the other denizens of these caves would have filled you in on this by now. The 'master' is all they can babble about. Dergiab - or 'the master', if you prefer - is an ogre mage of some power... He was also my former partner until he fell in with that cult and betrayed me.~ /*Dergiab - or 'the master', if you prefer - is an ogre mage of some power... He was also my former partner until he fell in with that cult and betrayed me.*/
@8 = ~I don't need to hear any more. You're free to go.~
@9 = ~Dergiab was your partner?~
@10 = ~Tell me more about this cult he fell in with.~
@11 = ~That's enough. Time to die!~
@12 = ~Ha! Are you thinking that I'll believe you actually came here to rescue me instead of simply stumbling across this cell? Forgive me if I'm skeptical, but I'll believe I'm rescued when I taste the fresh air of the surface, not before then.~ /*Forgive me if I'm skeptical, but I'll believe I'm rescued when I taste the fresh air of the surface, not before then.*/
@13 = ~Then leave for the surface, and quickly.~
@14 = ~Answer my questions, and I'll consider your fate.~
@15 = ~So you're some kind of prisoner, then?~
@16 = ~I'll not give you the chance to backstab me!~
@17 = ~No need to make threats. If you have questions, I'll be more than happy to answer them... I assume you're here to fight Dergiab, no?~
@18 = ~Why would I want to fight him?~
@19 = ~I'll be here. Heck, I couldn't go anywhere if I wanted to...~
@20 = ~I'll be glad to leave all this far, far behind. I thank you for releasing me, my <RACE> friend. We won't meet again.~
@21 = ~He was. At least he was until he went away and came back with that cultist. Before that, we recruited our army together.~
@22 = ~What were you recruiting an army for and how big has it gotten?~
@23 = ~I don't know much about it. Dergiab came back from one of his outings with a cultist beside him. He claimed there had been a change of plans. Dergiab only listened to the cultist after that. Said he was preparing the army for some different purpose, something greater. I objected, naturally. Foolishly, as it turns out, seeing as where it got me.~ /*I don't know much about it. Dergiab came back from one of his outings with a cultist beside him. He claimed there had been a change of plans.*/
@24 = ~Tell me more about this cultist.~
@25 = ~Do you know what purpose the cult wanted the army for?~
@26 = ~NP: That's what I thought! Well, come here, despicable <RACE>... I want to die in battle!!!~ /*As I thought! Come at me, then, <RACE> fool... Let me die fighting!!*/
@27 = ~Is there any other reason for you to be down here? Dergiab still has our small army, after all, and likely lots of treasure.~
@28 = ~Hmph? For what else? To gain power. We wanted to do the same as Sythsillis down in Amn! Maybe even raid Luskan... There aren't many soldiers, yet. I was insistent on picking only the best of the bugbears, orcs and goblins in these caves... and that's slim pickings.~ /*There aren't many soldiers, yet. I was insistent on picking only the best of the bugbears, orcs and goblins in these caves... and that's slim pickings.*/
@29 = ~His name's Ganon. He's an assassin or rogue or somesuch thing. I never spoke to him much, so I couldn't tell you more.~
@30 = ~No. Dergiab would only say that they needed the forces for the "Return," whatever that means. The cultist wouldn't elaborate, at least, not to me.~
@31 = ~Back again? Have you decided to finish off what Dergiab has started, after all?~ [NWNUG051]
