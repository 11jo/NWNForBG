@0 = ~Sorry, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, but I can't let you in. My employer likes his privacy.~
@1 = ~Who lives here?~
@2 = ~Perhaps I could arrange a meeting with the owner?~
@3 = ~Fine. Can I ask you some questions, then?~
@4 = ~I am a member of the city guard under Aribeth. I think I can enter.~
@5 = ~NP: Step aside and let me in, otherwise blame yourself.~ /*You'll stand aside and let me enter, or it's your head.*/
@6 = ~Goodbye.~
@7 = ~This is none other than the home of the noble Meldanen, one of the greatest sorcerers in the city! The man enjoys his privacy, as well, so you'll do well to just keep on walking. You don't bother him, he won't bother you, heh.~ /*The man enjoys his privacy, as well, so you'll do well to just keep on walking. You don't bother him, he won't bother you, heh.*/
@8 = ~No. He doesn't meet with anyone. And before you ask, he doesn't have visitors... period. Now go.~
@9 = ~Don't take all day. My time is valuable.~
@10 = ~What exactly goes on here?~
@11 = ~Have you heard anything about strange creatures hereabouts?~
@12 = ~Have you been feeling any symptoms of the plague, yet? If not, you will soon.~
@13 = ~What will it take for me to get inside?~
@14 = ~I don't care if you're Lord Bloody Nasher, himself, and neither would Lord Meldanen. You're not getting in.~
@15 = ~How about 200 gp? Would that change your mind?~
@16 = ~You don't want trouble with me, fool. Think very carefully.~
@17 = ~NP: I SAY, I serve Aribet! You risk angering her! Forget about Meldanen, think about yourself!~ /*I SAID that I serve Lady Aribeth! You risk her wrath if you don't stand aside! Meldanen be damned, think of yourself!*/
@18 = ~Then I'll have to do this the hard way. Time to die, fool.~
@19 = ~NP: Is it true? Or maybe you will return to where you came from, and I will just forget about your words, huh?~ /*Oh yeah? How about you just slink back to the castle and I'll forget you said that, little <PRO_MANWOMAN>.*/
@20 = ~NP: I serve Aribeth! You risk angering her! Forget about Meldanen, think about yourself!~ /*Me works for Aribeth and Nasher guy. You let me go.*/
@21 = ~On your way.~
@22 = ~Lord Meldanen lives here, of course. He's one of them sorcerer types, so some strangeness is expected. Lots of it, actually. But that's okay. We don't go inside the mansion... well, except for that dunce, Grommin... so the strangeness can just stay in there for all we care. Beyond that, it's nothing you need concern yourself about. Local folks are just superstitious, that's all.~ /*But that's okay. We don't go inside the mansion... well, except for that dunce, Grommin... so the strangeness can just stay in there for all we care.*/
@23 = ~Lord Meldanen has lots of strange creatures. It's sort of his hobby, or something. You'd have to be more specific.~
@24 = ~Maybe he acquired some new creature very recently?~
@25 = ~W-what do you mean? There's no plague in Blacklake!~
@26 = ~Not yet. You're in danger, however. That's why I came.~
@27 = ~Of course not. Forgive me... let me ask you something else.~
@28 = ~(sigh) If that's all you're wondering about, you may as well forget it. Lord Meldanen sees no one except a select few friends. And they don't even come through the front gate. So that makes my job very easy. I don't let anyone in... period.~ /*(sigh) If that's all you're wondering about, you may as well forget it. Lord Meldanen sees no one except a select few friends.*/
@29 = ~Let me ask you something else, then.~
@30 = ~Hmmm, yes, that would do nicely. Don't really care what happens to the rich fool, personally. Go on in, then. I'll pretend I didn't see anything.~ /*Hmmm, yes, that would do nicely. Don't really care what happens to the rich fool, personally.*/
@31 = ~Hmph. Well, I... ah, that is... I suppose one shouldn't (cough!) impede the city guard. No, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Go on in, then. I'll pretend I didn't see anything.~ /*Hmph. Well, I... ah, that is... I suppose one shouldn't (cough!) impede the city guard. No, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.*/
@32 = ~L-look, I don't want any trouble from her Ladyship. This just isn't worth the risk. I have to work in this city. I'll allow you to enter.~
@33 = ~What?! Attack the fool!!~
@34 = ~Well, no, no creatures that I can think of. Though there is that... uh, but I shouldn't really mention that. Nevermind.~
@35 = ~No, no, I want to hear this. Is this creature dangerous?~
@36 = ~Tell me now. I won't ask you twice.~
@37 = ~It... it's that sorcerer's magics, ain't it? I just knew it! He's gone an' given us the plague!! I ain't going to stand around to die! I'm getting out of here!! Run, ruuuunnnn!!~ /*I ain't going to stand around to die! I'm getting out of here!! Run, ruuuunnnn!!*/
@38 = ~Uh... er, yes, of course...~
@39 = ~No, not dangerous. I wouldn't even call her a creature, really. She's quite pretty... just, I don't know... odd. No idea what Lord Meldanen might want with her... heh, besides the obvious. I guess even a sorcerer gets lonely, eh?~ /*No idea what Lord Meldanen might want with her... heh, besides the obvious. I guess even a sorcerer gets lonely, eh?*/
@40 = ~Is this... guest... of Meldanen's still here?~
@41 = ~Never you mind. I ain't discussing Lord Meldanen's business.~
@42 = ~I don't care how many times you ask me. You can't bully me around, that's for sure.~
@43 = ~That's it. You've been asking for this... time to die!~
@44 = ~I don't know. I think so. We haven't seen her leave, that's for sure.~
@45 = ~Go on, get out of here, you! You certainly won't be allowed in here.~
@46 = ~NP: Come in if you need it. I'll pretend I don't see anything.~ /*Go on in, then. I'll pretend I didn't see anything.*/
