@2 = ~How did you survive the attack?~
@3 = ~Are you hurt? Is there anything I can do to help?~
@4 = ~We heard their war cries and we were able to run off before they found us. But we had to leave our wagons behind and they looted our goods. We need someone to help us repair our caravan.... OH NO!!! The Uthgardt are back! Run for your life!~
