@0 = ~NP: Greetings. Decided to join the legions of the damned, huh? Beggars Nest is the closest place to Hell in all of Fairun. Zombies everywhere. I suggest you be on your guard, my friend. You seem to have a lot of potential, and there are more than enough opportunities to die here.~ /*Zombies are everywhere. I advise caution, my friend. You look like you might have potential, and there's been enough death here already.*/
@1 = ~How bad is it getting in this district?~
@2 = ~Are there any safe locations?~
@3 = ~Have you heard anything about Waterdhavian creatures?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Bad enough, though the man I thought I had lost made it back. Thanks to you if you had anything to do with it. He'll help us pick off the undead from here.~
@6 = ~NP: I don't want to lose men in a hopeless fight again. Let the dead do what they want. We'll kill them from fortified places like this. We're safe as long as the barricades aren't destroyed, but damn them, why did they have to burn the corpses so the wind would blow the ashes everywhere. Ew! And why did the dead get so restless?~ /*We're okay if we stay barricaded, but damnation, why did they have to start burning corpses upwind. Ugh! And why did the dead have to start getting restless?*/
@7 = ~You lost a guard? Who was it?~
@8 = ~Is there a reason for the undead infestation?~
@9 = ~Back to my previous questions.~
@10 = ~A couple, I suppose, but it depends on what you call safe. I don't put much stock in what some people are spouting.~
@11 = ~So who would you trust? Where is the safest place?~
@12 = ~You don't agree with some people's methods of helping?~
@13 = ~NP: Aribeth instructed you to find them? Lady Aribeth instructed me as well, but she didn't say much. Nothing useful, anyway. You need them for a spell or something, don't you? Eh! I'm not risking my men for some scum. Find them yourself if you want. It's none of my business.~ /*They were for a spell or something, right? Bah! I won't risk my men on a scavenger hunt. Search if you want. Nothing to do with me.*/
@14 = ~I'd get yourself to the Shining Serpent. There's too many undead... and some citizens are just as vicious.~
@15 = ~We're okay if we stay barricaded, but damnation, why did they have to start burning corpses upwind. Ugh! And why did the dead have to start getting restless?~
@16 = ~NP: A promising young guard named Walters. A local boy who grew up in Beggars Nest. It's a shame. He was always industrious. He's not like the others. He didn't join a gang like most of his friends. Now he probably died at the hands of zombies.~ /*A promising young guard named Walters. A local boy that grew up in the Beggar's Nest. A shame... He worked hard...*/
@17 = ~Where did you see him last?~
@18 = ~If there is a reason behind any of this, nobody is telling me. First the plague, and now this. I got no answers.~
@19 = ~Ask what you will.~
@20 = ~NP: The last time he was seen, he was on patrol. There was no way to talk him out of it. I think he's got some old friends in the neighborhood. He usually patrols the northwest part of the Nest. There's enough dark personalities there without zombies.~ /*Last I saw he was heading out to patrol. Couldn't tell him not to. He's got old friends in this district, I guess.*/
@21 = ~NP: You should find Harben Aschensmith. He'll know what's what. He's probably at the Shining Serpent, which is the safest place in the area. It's in the north central part of the Nest. I suggest you head there. There you will find a few realists trying to find the right way to survive.~ /*It's in the south central area of the Nest. That's where I'd go. Bunch of realists, looking for solid ways to survive.*/
@22 = ~NP: That's not for me to say. If you need a safe place, I suggest you go to the safe haven that the Helmites of Destera have established in the southeast. However, I can't say I'd go there myself. Sure, zombies avoid going in there, but I honestly don't put much faith in all those Helmite blessings.~ /*I'll also tell you, however, that I wouldn't go there. Sure, the zombies avoid it, but I just don't put much stock in them Helmite blessings.*/
@23 = ~Myself, I prefer a sword in my hand to some foolish hope in my head. I'd recommend you talk to Harben Ashensmith in the Shining Serpent instead.~
@24 = ~Don't know what's been happening, but the undead have dropped off completely. Not much for us to do here now.~
@25 = ~NP: I don't even have to worry about my missing people. Walters is back safe and sound! Thank you, if you had anything to do with it. Of course the plague is still a threat, but there is still action being taken somewhere and that will be taken care of. I just hope we don't get used to the smell of burning corpses before we win. Ð­...~ /*The plague is still a concern, of course, but there are things being done elsewhere for that. I just hope I don't get used to the stink of burning dead before we beat it. Ugh...*/
@26 = ~It was a Yuan-Ti named Gulnan who caused it all.~
@27 = ~The Beggar's Nest should be fine now.~
@28 = ~The plague is still a concern, of course, but there are things being done elsewhere for that. I just hope I don't get used to the stink of burning dead before we beat it. Ugh...~
@29 = ~NP: Yuan-ti? What in the name of the abyss is Yuan-ti doing in Neverwinter? Wait... is that one of the Waterdeep creatures? Damn them all to hell! I realize we need a cure and all, but I lost my best men in a fight with a mob of zombies. Damn her, who let that snake loose? Hopefully I'll have an answer when I file my report.~ /*I know we need a cure and all, but I lost good men to that zombie horde. Blast it, who let that snake beast loose? I'd better get some answers when I file my report.*/
@30 = ~I should hope so. You took a big risk wandering around in there. It could have turned out much worse. Thanks for all your effort.~
@31 = ~Good luck to you, wherever duty takes you. Make sure you keep Aribeth apprised of what you've found.~
