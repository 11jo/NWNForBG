@0 = ~Well, hello there. I fear you have "mistaken" my unlocked door as an invitation to enter. Forgive me if this was misleading, as it was not my intent to allow entry to just any stranger off the street. Please accept my apologies, but I should appreciate it if you would leave. Mine husband       is one of the guards and I should think he would be perturbed if there were people milling about his house when he got home.~
@1 = ~I should not like to appear rude, but you have entered mine house without permission. I hardly think merely having an unlocked door is an invitation. Leave lest my husband extricate you himself when he returns from guard duty.~
@2 = ~You must be a considerable fool to enter this house uninvited. Best that you should leave, because if I call the guard there is a good chance my husband will be with them. No doubt he would expel you from his own house with... extra vigor.~
@3 = ~My husband should be here soon; I would suggest that you leave.~
@4 = ~I wish I could run away with you darling, but my husband can be such a jealous man. I wouldn't want to arouse his wrath. Take this ring, with which you may always remember me.~
@5 = ~Get away from me!~
@6 = ~I told you my husband would be here!~
