@2 = ~I hear there's a split among the Bloodsailors who have settled in this region. Some support Vengaul, while others have taken Callik's side.~
@3 = ~Jerol, the owner of the Twenty in a Quiver, accepts Smugglers' Coin for some reason, what a fool! You can't buy anything in other parts of the city with those coins anyway.~
@4 = ~Vengaul spread a rumor that one of the ingredients for a cure for pestilence would be auctioned off. It seems the auction has been canceled, I don't know why.~
@5 = ~Lieutenant Callik is an impatient and greedy man... He may have taken, uh, some measures to get rid of old Vengaul, Bloodysailors' leaders.~
@6 = ~There are a few places in the docks where you can go down into the sewers, but I wouldn't advise you to go there. It's run by Bloodysailors, and you'll be dead before you know it.~
@7 = ~If you meet Helm's priests on the street, don't trust them. All their favors are worthless, and the priests themselves are suspicious.~
