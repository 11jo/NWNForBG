@0 = ~NP: Greetings, <SIRMAAM>! The Howling Death has taken many lives beyond these gates. The peninsula is a dangerous area, we are now restricting access there by order of Lady Aribeth. I assume you have the proper authorization to enter the area?~ /*Hail, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Peninsula is a dangerous place and we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders.*/
@1 = ~Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.~
@2 = ~What kind of clearance do I need?~
@3 = ~Why do I need clearance?~
@4 = ~Sorry, no.~
@5 = ~Aye, there was word she'd be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?~
@6 = ~Could you answer some questions about the Peninsula district?~
@7 = ~I've got some general questions that need answers...~
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~We're under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you'll have to remain in the Core.~
@10 = ~NP: Look, Howling Death is no joke. I don't even want to think about how many people died. Even Lord Nasher himself is said to be ill. We don't have a cure - not yet - so we're doing what we can. Restrict movement, prevent crowds. In other words. you'd better have a permit.~ /*We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.*/
@11 = ~Then don't waste my time.~
@12 = ~I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.~
@13 = ~Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~What do you know of the Wailing Death?~
@15 = ~Are you familiar with Lady Aribeth?~
@16 = ~Be careful. There's plenty of danger afoot.~
@17 = ~NP: Yeah, my friend Haggard was on night watch at the Academy when the caravan of creatures arrived. We found him in the morning, his throat slit, next to the empty cages. He was clutching tightly in his hand the symbol of Helm, the patron god of all of us guards. That's how we buried him... to honor him.~ /*Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages.*/
@18 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@19 = ~Do you know anything else about what happened that night?~
@20 = ~Too little to cure it, too much to live without fear. Our only hope is to find those Waterdhavian creatures. Without them, every last one of us is dead.~
@21 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?~
@22 = ~I'm interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.~
@23 = ~Can't say I know her as well as Abbot Fenthick, har har! But, aye, she has been a pillar of this community since she was knighted.~
@24 = ~Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?~
@25 = ~Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?~
@26 = ~NP: Lady Aribet herself knows the most about it. She's a kind soul, and she's killer smart. It's a good thing she's in charge of the search. Is there anything else you need?~ /*The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search.*/
@27 = ~I have some questions about the Peninsula district.~
@28 = ~NP: The rest, as they say, is history. The Waterdeep creatures abducted from their cages vanished into the night, and now none of us know where they're hiding. Is there anything else you need?~ /*The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all.*/
@29 = ~NP: Perhaps you should see the Helmite, Dester. He's new here, but he risks his own health by dispensing Helm's blessings to those affected by the pestilence. Is there anything else you need?~ /*You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck.*/
@30 = ~NP: I lost half my family. I remain a guardian in their memory. Is there anything else you need?~ /*Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory.*/
@31 = ~NP: If you want gossip about Lady Aribet, you'd better talk to Mr. Fentick. They're to be married in the summer, you know... Is there anything else you need?~ /*If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know...*/
@32 = ~NP: I'm afraid not. We shouldn't pry into a man's private affairs, especially in these sad times. Is there anything else you need?~ /*I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this.*/
@33 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
@34 = ~Is there any way I can help out in there?~
@35 = ~How bad is it in there?~
@36 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Peninsula district?~
@37 = ~Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?~
@38 = ~Hmm, I don't think there's much to do anymore. The problem in the prison has been dealt with, as far as I know.~
@39 = ~Well, Commander Sebile came tearing through here on militia orders a while back... but I probably shouldn't be talking about that. There are enough rumors in this city already without me adding to them.~
@40 = ~Look, I'm here to help, remember?~
@41 = ~NP: Things are much better now. I don't know what happened in there, but it looks like the fugitives have been dealt with. Things are pretty quiet now. Is there anything else you wanted to know?~ /*Not so bad anymore. I'm not sure what all happened, but I understand that the prisoners have been dealt with. It's pretty quiet now.*/
@42 = ~NP: It's just awful - I can't go in there without my gear. The gate guard, Captain Kipp, will tell you all about it when you're on the other side. Is there anything else you wanted to know?~ /*It's pretty bad - I certainly wouldn't go in unequipped. Gate Captain Kipp can brief you once you're on the other side.*/
@43 = ~There's not much there, to be honest. With the prison at the top of the rise and all, most reputable folk and businesses steer clear. You should probably talk to Gate Captain Kipp on the other side - he can fill you in.~
@44 = ~NP: I think you're right... Actually, there was a prison break. She was sent on a sweep. If you want to know anything else, I suggest you talk to Commander Sebil herself. She's set up a temporary headquarters somewhere in the neighborhood. Is there anything else you wanted to know?~ /*If you want to know more about it, I suggest you talk to Commander Sebile in person. She'll have a temporary headquarters set up somewhere in the District.*/

@46 = ~NP: Greetings, <SIRMAAM>! Howling Death has taken many lives beyond these gates. The peninsula is a dangerous area, but things are much better now.
