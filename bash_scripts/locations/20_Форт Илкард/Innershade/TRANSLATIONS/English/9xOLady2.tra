@0    = ~It's you, am I right? I woke up in my house, but not as the old lady I used to be. I woke up as the young girl I used to be a long time ago. Do you recognize me? It's me, Barbara... Granny Bunny. What did you do? How did you revive me and restore my youth?~
@1    = ~Well, it was indeed I who revived you, Barbara. I missed your stories and biscuits, isn't it obvious?~
@2    = ~I don't know. I just did so, and that's all.~
@3    = ~You can't die like that. You were so kind, and you made delicious biscuits... I had to find a way to bring you back, and I think I succeeded.~
@4    = ~Oh, if you revived me because of biscuits, then they must have been really good! Think of the things I could do with ten plates of them! I could probably rule the world!~
@5    = ~Well, how cute of you! You act like it was something common and natural! Trust me, it's a most extraordinary situation.~
@6    = ~(The girl's face changes to a more serious expression.) I don't know what you gave in exchange to bring me back, my child, but I'm afraid it was an equal exchange. Thank you.~
@7    = ~Now I'll stay here, in Innershade, as a protector and guardian of my family.~
@8    = ~I understand, but are you sure you don't want to join my party?~
@9    = ~I'm glad you'll protect something you love. I hope we'll meet again. A great quest awaits me. If I survive, we'll meet again quite soon.~
@10   = ~All right. I have to go now.~
@11   = ~I'm sorry, but I can't. Maybe in the future, but not now. I have to help over here a bit. For a long time, I was a burden to the villagers. Now I may help them. Also, I promised Eva that I'd meet her for some wine.~
@12   = ~I'm afraid for you, my child. I know that you'll face a strong enemy quite soon. Something is going to happen. I don't know the details, but I can sense it. Call it an adventurer's sense.~
@13   = ~You'll always be welcome in Innershade. I'll still live in my house in the southwest part of the village. Take care, my child. I hope this is not our farewell yet. No, I certainly believe it is not.~
@14   = ~I understand, but please take care of yourself. You'll always be welcome in the village of Innershade, and in my house, <CHARNAME>.~
@15   = ~Hello to you, my child. I have a lot to do. It's good to have so much energy again! Thank you again for giving me another chance to live. I'll never forget what you've done. I'll have to provide you tea and biscuits till the end of my days!~
