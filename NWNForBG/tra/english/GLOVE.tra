@0 = ~NP: Hey, guys. Welcome, make yourselves at home. Just try not to bother the locals, okay? Times are tough, so they're in enough trouble as it is. Well, what can I do for you?~ /*Greetings, . Welcome to the dead lands of Kel Garas, though, as I am sure you have noticed, I am not quite dead.*/
@1 = ~NP: Show us what you have to offer.~ /*Have you any other services?*/
@2 = ~Nothing.~
@3 = ~NP: Hi. I don't want no trouble from you hobos. Looks like every other bar in this town has already kicked you out. You're not gonna stay here for long if you're loud. If you don't, you're welcome. Well, what can I do for you?~ /*Do I know her name? Was I supposed to have gazed into a crystal ball or found her name etched in the starry sky? How would I know who she is?*/
