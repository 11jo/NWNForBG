@0 = ~Aye, now... how about a lad like yourself takes a lass like me for an evening o' pleasure? Only a gold or two, no more.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~A gold or two? For you? You must be joking.~
@3 = ~You haves sores. You gots plague, no?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Oh, fine, fine. It's not like the gold is leaping into my lap today, after all.~
@6 = ~Why are you out here on the street? You're sick, you should be inside somewhere.~
@7 = ~How has the plague affected your trade?~
@8 = ~Could you tell me anything about the plague?~
@9 = ~Is there anything going on in this area of the city?~
@10 = ~I need some directions.~
@11 = ~NP: Oh, well, yeah, yeah. I have the plague or something, and you don't. You can point your finger at me, but I'm still alive. So do you want something, or are you just gonna stand there and stare?~ /*Oh, aye, aye. I've got the plague or something just as good, an' you don't. You may wag your finger at me, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, but I ain't dead yet.*/
@12 = ~You have the plague?! Get away from me!!~
@13 = ~I... a workin' girl does not normally beg t' make her keep, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... but these ain't no normal times. Could you spare some kindness, mayhap?~
@14 = ~Waste coin on you? I think not.~
@15 = ~I could offer you mercy. A quick and painless death.~
@16 = ~I have nothing to give.~
@17 = ~Here... take a gold piece.~
@18 = ~Take this: 100 gp. Go and find someplace warm tonight, and rest.~
@19 = ~NP: Ah, come again.~ /*Ah, damn.*/
@20 = ~Inside where? When you has the plague, nobody wants to take you in. You ain't got no family, even. And I ain't settin' foot in the Moonstone Mask, no way.~
@21 = ~NP: Why don't you go to the Mask of the Moonstone?~ /*Why wouldn't you go to the Moonstone Mask?*/
@22 = ~NP: Ha! You think if girls can't find a one-night stand in all of Neverwinter, they'll be upset? Not at all, let me tell you. People in this town, they all think they're gonna die. Convinced of it, that's right. So they gather at the Mask of the Moonstone, want to have a little fun. Ah, they're even looking for me. Those people with the Howling Death... They don't deserve it. They want to have fun, too, as they always have.... And I won't send them away.~ /*The souls in this city, they all thinks they're going to die. Convinced of it, they are. So they pile together in the Moonstone Mask, lookin' for a last bit of joy.*/
@23 = ~NP: But you certainly don't need the money.~ /*But you certainly don't need the coin if, ah...*/
@24 = ~I can tells you plenty about the plague. From personal experience, in fact. Anything specific you wanted to know, aye?~
@25 = ~Do you know anything about what causes it?~
@26 = ~Have you heard anything about strange animals in the area?~
@27 = ~NP: I'd like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@28 = ~There's always things going on in the core. Most of it is out o' reach of my ears, however, except maybe the urgent whisperings of dyin' men.~
@29 = ~Maybe you've heard of something of interest?~
@30 = ~I'd be interested in work, if you know of anything.~
@31 = ~Go on, now, I don't have time to give directions when you could just find things yourself. Ask a guard, it'll keep them busy and away from me.~
@32 = ~Then begone, cruel <PRO_LADYLORD>. May the plague take ye, too.~
@33 = ~I... no. No, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I thank you, but 'tis not my time just yet.~
@34 = ~Then leave me be and go on yer ways.~
@35 = ~Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, you are most gracious and kind. My babes will eat tonight, thanks to you.~
@36 = ~I... you are too kind, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! Bless you, bless your heart! My babes... my babes will live, once I'm gone. Bless you!!~
@37 = ~NP: No. We girls see sick people sometimes, but that's not the point. The disease is in the air, no one can be safe from it. The girls in the Mask of the Moonstone don't seem to have the plague. Or maybe their madam is just good at hiding it. That's probably it.~ /*The girls at the Moonstone, they don't seem t' get the plague none. Could be the matron mother just hides it real well. More like, 'n fact.*/
@38 = ~Anything else you can tell me?~
@39 = ~NP: If I die, what's the big deal? Yeah, I'm gonna die soon. But I have kids, and they're healthy. They'll be orphans. It will be very bad for them. I'll give them what I can before the Howling Death takes me. That's all I can do.~ /*That'll be bad enough, for them. I'm going to give 'em what I can, before the Wailing Death takes me. Nothin' else I can do.*/
@40 = ~NP: Hmm. I don't like the madam, this Ofala Sheldarsthorne. There's something wrong with her, I tell you. The Mask of the Moonstone has too many rules. No, no, I belong out here on the street. If I die, it'll be next to that pile over there.~ /*That an' the Moonstone has too many rules. No, no, the only place for me is out on th' streets. That way, when I die, I ain't far from the pile over yonder.*/
@41 = ~NP: Strange animals? You mean monsters? No, no monsters in these parts, never heard of any. If you're saying these monsters roam the center.... No, I don't want to hear about it. There's enough people dying at night as it is. Is there anything else you wanted?~ /*If you're tellin' me that there's beasts roaming about the core... well, I don't want to hear none of it. There's enough death comin' for you in the nights as it is.*/
@42 = ~Do you know anything about what causes it?~
@43 = ~What do you want to know?~
@44 = ~NP: Lots of things. You can go to Nevers Castle, it's definitely interesting. Say hello for me. You can wander around if you want. You'll definitely find something interesting.~ /*Depends. You could go to Castle Never, t'is interesting enough. Send them me love, if you would.*/
@45 = ~NP: Everybody's saving their money, and they don't hire anybody. Except for the Mask of the Moonstone. Probably not even there. But I think there are jobs to be found. People have a lot to do, especially when the city's in such a mess. But I haven't heard anything concrete.~ /*Oh, I suppose there's work to be had. There's all kinds of things people need doin', especially with a city in chaos. Nothing that reaches my ears, however.*/
@46 = ~NP: No. Stay here for a while, you'll learn everything you need to know and a little more. Is there anything else you need?~ /*Nope. Wait around some, you'll learn all you wants to an' more, I'm sure.*/
@47 = ~What do you need, girl? I have to work, yet, for a gold or so... lest I sleep in the street again an' catch the plague myself.~
@48 = ~NP: You're back? You shouldn't be wandering around here. I am sick with the Howling Death, <LADYLORD>.~ /*Back again, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? You should really not be hangin' about me so much... I *am* ill with the Wailing Death, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.*/
