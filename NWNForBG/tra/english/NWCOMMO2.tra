@3 = ~Looks like you're ready to head out in search of the traitor Aribeth - you're armed and everything!~
@4 = ~You may be a famous hero and all, <CHARNAME>, but you don't need to walk around camp with your weapon drawn all the time!~
@5 = ~I didn't expect to see another <RACE> face in these parts - especially not one as famous as yours, <CHARNAME>.~ 
@6 = ~Gend must be paying you guys a fortune, <CHARNAME>. I heard you <RACE> heroes don't work cheap.~
@7 = ~I know we need all the help we can get, but I don't trust them Uthgardt up on the plateau.~
@8 = ~Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we're fighting for before we ship off to the front.~
@9 = ~You're here to save us all from that big, bad Luskan army, aren't you?~
