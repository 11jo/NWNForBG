@0 = ~Hi there. You nice? You look nice. Momma says lots people aren't nice. Maybe even downstairs.~
@1 = ~What's downstairs? Is there something in your house?~
@2 = ~You shouldn't be outside. It's dangerous.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Yeah, there's something behind the bookcase, but momma says not to talk about... uh... I can't say anymore.~
@5 = ~MT: Probably, but mom doesn't care. She says people can get sick at home, at work, at church, so why can't I go out? Besides, she was angry because I climbed behind the closet again. He says he can't go there.~ /*I 'spose, but Momma doesn't mind. She says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what's wrong with me in the street?*/
@6 = ~MT: And what about the closet? Is there anything in your house?~ /*What's downstairs? Is there something in your house?*/
@7 = ~Okay, goodbye and stuff.~
@8 = ~I don't want momma to know I know the secret word. You maybe go talk to her about it, okay?~
@9 = ~Secret word? Tell me about it. We're friends, right?~
@10 = ~Tell me the word or I'll get you in trouble. I'll tell your mother you stole something.~
@11 = ~MT: Well maybe. Just don't tell your mom. I hide behind a bookshelf. You speak the word and it opens. True, it's kind of a stupid word. The word is &quot;hal-uu-et&quot;. I don't know what it means, but when you say it, a shelf opens. Strange, right?~ /*Well, I guess. Just don't tell momma. I hide behind the bookshelf. You say a word and it opens. It's a silly word, though.*/
@12 = ~No, I'll get in trouble. I don't want make things worse. Mommy cries a lot because of people getting sick.~
@13 = ~MT: Why lie like that? You know it's not true. I'll tell you, just don't lie to your mom. Still, it's just a word. It opens a bookshelf. The word is &quot;hal-uu-et&quot;. I don't know what it means, but when you say it, the shelf opens. Strange, right? Now go away, you beech.~ /*Why you gotta lie like that? I never did nothing. I'll tell you, just don't lie to momma. It's just a word, anyway. It opens the bookshelf.*/
@14 = ~I 'spose, but Momma doesn't mind. She says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what's wrong with me in the street?~
@15 = ~Who you? Ha? You come for my house? Don't think so. I'll kick your tail! Like I keep the bad guys downstairs!~
@16 = ~You ugly. Basement ugly.~
@17 = ~MT: Mom says people can get sick at home, at work, at church, so why can't I go for a walk?~ /*I 'spose, but Momma doesn't mind. She says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what's wrong with me in the street?*/
