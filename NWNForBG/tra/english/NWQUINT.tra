@0 = ~Welcome to where the dead lie! Or is it lay? I forget which is which when they do both. I am Quint... I think.~ [NWQUI053]
@1 = ~What are you babbling about?~
@2 = ~What kind of disaster happened here?~
@3 = ~Greetings. What is this place?~
@4 = ~Move aside! I'm in no mood for you!~
@5 = ~Get out of way, crazy fool!~
@6 = ~You walk in the Charwood, a town that is nowhere... or more, no-WHEN. What does that mean? Like I know? I'm alive, but I stay! Everyone stays, no matter what. That's what happened in Castle Jhareg. We made everyone stay. All for my brother. All for the children.~ /*Everyone stays, no matter what. That's what happened in Castle Jhareg. We made everyone stay. All for my brother. All for the children.*/
@7 = ~Tell me about your brother.~
@8 = ~I seek a cult behind the plague in Neverwinter.~
@9 = ~Enough. Leave me!~
@10 = ~Goodbye, then.~
@11 = ~That's what my brother Karlat said! That's what he said, and I said no! He wouldn't listen, of course. He wasn't the listening type. He went ahead, but I said no! I put a stop to it, but it didn't stop! It was too late! You'll see! Maybe you'll see!~ /*He went ahead, but I said no! I put a stop to it, but it didn't stop! It was too late! You'll see! Maybe you'll see!*/
@12 = ~A brother, a monster, a lord. Take your pick. All are right, and none are left. Heh. See, that was funny because... ah, nevermind. Karlat and I are Lords of this place, but this place is nowhere, and our rule is nowhere. We sacrificed it all a long time ago.~ /*Karlat and I are Lords of this place, but this place is nowhere, and our rule is nowhere. We sacrificed it all a long time ago.*/
@13 = ~Can't you give a straight answer?~
@14 = ~A plague? Ah, a bane of the living. A plague would find no purchase here. Your cult? I don't know. Maybe. Could be. My brother was many things and halves of things. He may have been in touch with a cult of sorts, but all that he touched dies. And all he didn't.~ /*My brother was many things and halves of things. He may have been in touch with a cult of sorts, but all that he touched dies. And all he didn't.*/
@15 = ~No, I'll see you again. I see everyone again. No one leaves. Not really. I stopped my brother Karlat, and he stopped everyone!~
@16 = ~Answers? I wish I had answers, decisions, judgments! All I have is what I took, and what Karlat won't let go! Over and over it plays! You think you know what's here, but you don't! It's not right, but the dead don't listen! They don't!~ /*Answers? I wish I had answers, decisions, judgments! All I have is what I took, and what Karlat won't let go! Over and over it plays!*/
@17 = ~You'll see. I'm alive, you're alive, but you can't change Castle Jhareg... and you can't change the dead... they never EVER listen!~ [NWQUI052]
