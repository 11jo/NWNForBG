@0 = ~What in the hells are you doing here? Not that I don't mind the help, but I thought we were locked down tight. Wait. You a new recruit? Aribeth saddle you with this job? Well, good luck if you're supposed to patrol in here. You'll need it.~ 
@1 = ~Why is this area so dangerous?~
@2 = ~Is there any way I can help out in there?~
@3 = ~I have information about what is going on.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~This is the docks. Don't go blabbing it, but everyone knows that the docks are controlled by pretty shifty characters. With the chaos of the plague, everyone seems to be acting like animals. The streets are thick with thieves. Thick!~ 
@6 = ~Have you seen any strange creatures?~
@7 = ~Just don't attract attention to us here. I don't want a mob killing me before the plague can, after all. You want to play hero, fine with me, but as far as I'm concerned, the animals in this district can have each other.~ 
@8 = ~What is there to know? The district is full of nothing but animals. The plague was all it took to let everything go to hell.~
@9 = ~Everyone is scrambling to get gold for an auction, stealing all they can.~
@10 = ~Fair enough. Goodbye for now.~
@11 = ~Careful in the Docks. There's lots of lowlife thugs. Should just barricade the lot of them.~
@12 = ~What, you think a grunt like me might have found Aribeth's precious Waterdhavian things? That's what you are asking, isn't it? Bah! I got a briefing about those, all right, and then I was stuck here! Why tell me about them if I'm not gonna be looking?! The only thing I'll see while I'm standing here is more blasted thieves. Let 'em all rot, I says.~ 
@13 = ~Ah, that auction is a load of crap. I'd bet it's all just a plan to get people into the Seedy Tavern and mug them.~
@14 = ~You knew about it? Why don't you do anything?~
@15 = ~Of course I knew. The first thug we put down had a notice on him. It's just one more reason for these dogs to slaughter each other. And they won't stop at that, either! Did you know that one of these mongrels had the gall to think I would try to get Lord Nasher himself to come here?~ 
@16 = ~As if I would waste my time. No, this lot can go to hell if they like. I'm just going to keep them from getting loose. Plague take them all!~
@17 = ~That is very closed-minded. Shouldn't people all get a chance to prove themselves?~
@18 = ~Every animal in here has already proved themselves worthless in my eyes. You want to play babysitter to a pack of wolves, you go right ahead.~
@19 = ~Patrol where you want and see where you get. Nothing but animals trapped in here. Stinking thieving peasant animals.~
@20 = ~Damned if I know what settled them down, but I ain't seen any trouble for a while now. Whatever was getting the locals all worked up seems to be over, I guess. No trouble here at all besides the plague.~
