Range: Visual range of the vampire
Duration: 8 rounds 
Casting Time: 1 
Area of Effect: 1 creature 
Saving Throw: Neg.

A vampire's mental abilities are powerful tools indeed. Domination enables the vampire to control the actions of any creature while the ability is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against their morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The target is allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect., Attribute: Small portrait=FORMERGU.BMP

Cerebus creates 6 exact duplicates of himself. These images do exactly what he does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual Cerebus. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attackвЂ”magical or otherwiseвЂ”it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck. However, it is important to note that this will not protect Cerebus against every attack, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real one amongst all the images., Attribute: Override script=NWSHOUT1.BCS

(Abjuration)

Level: 1
Range: 40 ft.
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

A Dispel Magic spell removes magical effects upon anyone within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Turning and Spell Deflection. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of the Dispel Magic is above the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the original caster, <PRO_HISHER> chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 5% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 5% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic <PRO_HESHE> is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Note: While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect., Attribute: Small portrait=LONDA.BMP

File: LORDSWNW.ITM, Name: Find Familiar
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the Beast Master to attempt to summon a familiar to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit its master, conveying its sensory powers to <PRO_HIMHER>, conversing with <PRO_HIMHER>, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A Beast Master can have only one familiar at a time, and <PRO_HESHE> has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all.

Note: This spell can only be cast by the protagonist.

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 Intelligence points), and its bond with the Beast Master confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The Beast Master has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The Beast Master receives half the familiar's total Hit Points (rounded down) as bonus Hit Points. However, the Beast Master must take care to treat <PRO_HISHER> familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the Beast Master loses the bonus Hit Points and the familiar's Hit Points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the Beast Master loses 1 point of Constitution PERMANENTLY.

Example: A Beast Master has 10 Hit Points and casts Find Familiar. The fairy dragon summoned has 24 Hit Points, so the Beast Master gets a bonus of 12 Hit Points. The Beast Master now has 22 Hit Points. If the familiar dies, the Beast Master loses those 12 Hit Points (putting <PRO_HIMHER> back at 10), loses 1 point of Constitution permanently (which may cause additional Hit Point loss), and takes 24 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the Beast Master receives according to alignment:

LAWFUL GOOD, NEUTRAL GOOD: Pseudo Dragon
вЂ“ Hit Points: 24
вЂ“ Armor Class: -2
вЂ“ Magic Resistance: 50%
вЂ“ Combat: 2 attacks per round at 13 THAC0 for 1d3 damage, save vs. Death or be rendered unconscious for 2 turns
вЂ“ Special Abilities: Can cast Blur once per day. Regenerates 1 HP/round. Immune to level drain, sleep, and petrification.

CHAOTIC GOOD: Fairy Dragon
вЂ“ Hit Points: 24
вЂ“ Armor Class: 4
вЂ“ Magic Resistance: 32%
вЂ“ Combat: 2 attacks per round at 13 THAC0 for 1d2 damage

Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried.
