@0 = ~You believe that chump? I got a chance to ship some marble into Waterdeep - that's some good gold in that deal! And he's throwing morality at me.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~What's the discussion about here?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Captain Mung, you can call me. And I own the boat that'll bring any goods from Port Llast to points beyond - points beyond that *I* choose. But that no good dock-master is making my life miserable. Tell me, would you be shipping into Neverwinter when you could be off to Waterdeep?~ /*But that no good dock-master is making my life miserable. Tell me, would you be shipping into Neverwinter when you could be off to Waterdeep?*/
@5 = ~Tell me the truth. I want details.~
@6 = ~I don't really care. Goodbye.~
@7 = ~That bum wants me to go to Neverwinter, but they got plague there. And I'm not risking my life to deliver some food and supplies. Especially not when my choice is risking my life, or getting some marble to Waterdeep for a real pay-day. I'm talking good money!~ /*Especially not when my choice is risking my life, or getting some marble to Waterdeep for a real pay-day. I'm talking good money!*/
@8 = ~Let me go talk to the dock master.~
@9 = ~I spoke with the dock-master, and I want you to change your mind.~
@10 = ~NP: Exactly. Happily, I hope I still get this shipment for Waterdeep.~ /*Very well. I hope to see Baram's head soon.*/
@11 = ~Bah. If you got any sense in you, you'll talk to that dock-master and give him a piece of my mind, before I strangle him!~
@12 = ~Thank you. I won't hold you to any promises, but if you can get him to give me the good shipment, I'd be thankful.~
@13 = ~What? You're taking his side? I'm not risking my life, or my men's life. Don't believe that the plague is cured.~
@14 = ~NP: Okay, I'll try to convince the owner of the dock.~ /*Let me go talk to the dock master.*/
@15 = ~What if I pay you to cover your costs?~
@16 = ~NP: I'm from Neverwinter. There is order, there is no more plague.~ /*Me from Neverwinter. It's okay. Me fixed plague.*/
@17 = ~And when all of those Neverwintans starve so you can get some extra gold...~
@18 = ~Pay? You'd pay me to go to Neverwinter? Is it that important to you? Well, all right. I'm a businessman. What's your offer?~
@19 = ~300 gold. Take it or leave it.~
@20 = ~100 gold... will that get you to Neverwinter?~
@21 = ~50 gold should cover the costs, yes?~
@22 = ~That's it. You're going to Neverwinter, or I'm doing some damage.~
@23 = ~NP: Argue with someone else, buddy. I am not interested. And I won't go there. The risk is not worth what I get.~ /*Argue with someone else, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I'm not interested. And I'm not going in there. It's not worth what I'd be making.*/
@24 = ~You had to put it like that, didn't you. Fine. I'll take the shipment. But you just leave me alone, now, all right? I got work to do.~
@25 = ~Ain't nothing you can say that ol' dock-master hasn't already tried, so beat off will you? Scram!~
@26 = ~Well, that's a fair offer, I suppose. Fine, I'll take it. I always wanted to do the right thing anyway. Just needed a push. Nice doing business...~
@27 = ~100 gold? And all I have to do is dump some food off in Neverwinter? All right. I'll do it. Nice doing business...~
@28 = ~Sorry, 100 gold is a nice offer, but it's not quite enough to make me want to risk a quick and ugly death.~
@29 = ~NP: 100 gold? Are you laughing at me. Offer me more, then I'll think about it.~ /*1000 gold? Are you out of your mind? I'm not giving you that much!*/
@30 = ~You can't tell me what to do! Who are you?! You do not tell me what to do!! That's it, I'm leaving. Forget about Port Llast. I don't need either shipment.~
@31 = ~You back again? I'm telling you, arguing with that fool dock-master Prichev is driving me insane. Why don't you go do something about this argument?~
@32 = ~NP: Tell me again, what's going on with the owner of the dock?~ /*Let me go talk to the dock master.*/
@33 = ~Sorry - this doesn't sound interesting. Goodbye.~
@34 = ~Stop bothering me so much, will ya? I got to get them goods packed up for Neverwinter, and time is tight.~
