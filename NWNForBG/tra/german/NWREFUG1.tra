@0 = ~I don't believe it. We can leave? The undead are gone? Thank you... thank you if you did this...~
@1 = ~Whew... lucky to have made it here. They killed everything... and then those dead got up... I barely got here.~
@2 = ~I'm glad this place is here. I could have tried to get to the Helmite sanctuary, but I really needed a drink.~
@3 = ~Zombies chased me the whole way here. I'm lucky to be alive.~
@4 = ~Gotta look at the good side, you know? Zombies don't loot. I might have a home to go back to when this is over.~
@5 = ~Lost everyone. We all just ran... don't know where the family is. No clue...~
@6 = ~You'd think the guards could have done something... but no... nothing... they stood on the wall...~
@7 = ~What is wrong with this city? Plague... zombies... did we kick the Fates' dog or something?~
@8 = ~Is there anything anyone can do? Anything? It's the damned walking dead out there, for crying out loud!~
@9 = ~Where are the guards? Where is Lord Nasher? They left us to die! To die!~
@10 = ~My neighbor... he died of the plague. Then he came back as a zombie. That's not going to happen to me... is it? IS IT!~
@11 = ~How long before they get in here? Zombies are mindless, but they'll smell us... they'll throw themselves at the doors. We're all going to die...~
@12 = ~I guess I should have tried to get to the City Core. There's certainly no help coming to us here.~
@13 = ~Where do we go now? Plague... zombies... where?~
@14 = ~Can you do something? Can you? I don't see how...~
