@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I have some questions.~
@3 = ~NP: What happened to you?~ /*What happened here?*/
@4 = ~Fine, I'll go.~
@5 = ~I am... or, rather, I was... the Countess Londa Whitesnow. That means nothing anymore. Now I am merely... Londa.~
@6 = ~Then what happened?~
@7 = ~Aww... poor rich noble lost all her gold?~
@8 = ~You lost your title? That isn't everything.~
@9 = ~Did you not hear me? I wish to be left alone, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Please respect that.~
@10 = ~At least tell me who you are, then.~
@11 = ~Why? What's wrong?~
@12 = ~I see. You're too good to talk to me, is that it?~
@13 = ~NP: (sighs) I see you are very persistent. Very good. Do you want to know what happened? I'll tell you... Although my story is far from the only one here. That villain, High Captain Baram broke into our house with soldiers. He wanted to take all our money... of course, to pay for his army and the war.~ /*That evil man, High Captain Baram, invaded our home with his soldiers. He desired all our wealth... to pay for his army and his war, no doubt.*/
@14 = ~You have my sincere thanks. I only wish to be left to my grief.~
@15 = ~You know nothing of me, and obviously you would not understand if you did. Indeed, I have no gold for myself or anyone else any longer. Now begone, and leave me to my misery.~
@16 = ~The title is nothing. I would have gladly given it up, and all the wealth that went with it, to still have my family. They are all that gave the others meaning.~
@17 = ~Uh-huh. It be bad story, me thinking.~
@18 = ~That... that is not what I meant at all. In fact, it is quite the opposite. I was once Countess Londa Whitesnow... but now I am... merely Londa.~
@19 = ~NP: Naturally, my husband began to resist. And without a single word from Baram... he... hacked my husband to death. Killed him. I still remember his laugh when he took my children... all nine... and kicked me out of my house. And then he burned it to the ground. Now my husband is dead and my children are in the hands of this demon. I know nothing of their fate, I have nothing left and I have nowhere to go. That's my whole story<SIRMAAM> .~ /*Now my husband is dead, and that fiend holds my children. I know nothing of their fate and have nothing left and nowhere to turn. That is my tale, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.*/
@20 = ~That is very sad.~
@21 = ~Sounds like a tough break.~
@22 = ~Hah! At least you're still alive.~
@23 = ~Aye, it is very sad. I would do anything to have my children back, but Baram will not even see me... and no one can help.~
@24 = ~Perhaps I could help.~
@25 = ~I could help... for the right reward.~
@26 = ~Yes, well, life's tough all over.~
@27 = ~You speak crudely, but it is true enough. I would do anything to have my children back... but Baram will not even see me, and no one can help.~
@28 = ~Forgive me, but that fact currently pales compared to all I have lost. Please... leave me to my misery.~
@29 = ~I am grateful. I only wish to be left to my misery.~
@30 = ~NP: You can do it? I'll give anything to save my children from this demon, or at least... at least to know that they're all right! I can reward you. I don't have any money here, but... my husband saved some. I know where the money is and I can tell you. I think this will be enough.~ /*Could you? I would give anything to have my children saved from that fiend, or to at least... at least know that they are all right!*/
@31 = ~Tell me where it is now and I'll do it.~
@32 = ~Very well... I'll help you.~
@33 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@34 = ~I changed my mind. Not interested.~
@35 = ~Aye... life is 'tough' for everyone in Luskan, and we should all just bear through it, is that what you mean? Just... leave me be, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@36 = ~I am no fool. If that is all there is that will get someone to find my children, then I will never give it up beforehand.~
@37 = ~I am glad to hear it. Have you any questions for me, then?~
@38 = ~Where can I find Baram?~
@39 = ~Do you know where your children might be?~
@40 = ~Why would Baram be holding your children?~
@41 = ~Does Baram have any enemies?~
@42 = ~NP: I do not have any questions.~ /*Me have other question.*/
@43 = ~I... I see. Then leave me alone.~
@44 = ~NP: Once his people had a base in the slums... But it was burned to the ground over a month ago, when the war was in full swing on the streets. And where he went after that, I... can't say. People say he lives in the sewers, but I hope he doesn't.~ /*His men once had a base in the slums... but that was burnt down more than a month ago as the war in the streets went on.*/
@45 = ~No. I have heard no news, and Baram will tell me nothing. He is the only one who would know where they are.~
@46 = ~I... wish I knew. Perhaps he has some sinister purpose in mind for them... I do not even want to imagine it. I am hoping he has already sent them somewhere or released them and I simply do not know where they are.~
@47 = ~Aye. The other High Captains who he has fought with these long weeks. Only Kurth remains... but no one is sure where he is. Kurth would want Baram dead, it is certain.~
@48 = ~You have given me a glimmer of hope. I... I wish you the best of luck.~
@49 = ~Londa, a world-weary woman staying at Luskan's Cutlass Inn, has lost all nine of her children to Baram, one of the city's vicious High Captains.

@50 = ~You have heard my sorry tale, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Is that not enough?~ [LONDA52]
@51 = ~You... return. Have you found my children? Are they safe?~ [LONDA51]
@52 = ~I have spoken to Baram... He says your children are safe.~
@53 = ~Baram has reneged on his deal. He will not release your children.~
@54 = ~Your children are fine, Londa... but I can't bring them to you.~ [Ложь]
@55 = ~I am sorry, Londa. All your children are dead...~
@56 = ~They're dead, actually. Baram and his rats ate them.~
@57 = ~NP: So far there are no results.~ /*Not yet, no.*/
@58 = ~NP: This is a great relief... Although until I see the children with my own eyes, I will doubt the veracity of what this demon says. Is there no way to save my children? You do not know?~ /*That is a great relief... though until I see my children in person, I have my doubts as to whether the fiend is telling the truth.*/
@59 = ~I have agreed to perform a service for Baram in return for their release.~
@60 = ~Baram wanted me to kill Kurth for their release, but I refused.~
@61 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@62 = ~NP: No! Noooo! Please... do something! A little more, and we would meet again! Please find my children!~ /*No! No-ooo! Please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... do something! I cannot come this close and not find them! Please find my babies!*/
@63 = ~Fine? I... but why not? Bring me to them, then! I must see them!~
@64 = ~Baram... sent them away. To orphanages, elsewhere. I don't know where they are.~
@65 = ~I can't lie to you, Londa. Your children are dead...~
@66 = ~Fine, make me tell the truth. Baram and his rats ate your kids.~
@67 = ~D-dead? No... no, I don't believe it...~
@68 = ~They... ate them?~
@69 = ~The small ones. The rest he turned into wererats... and they're dead, too.~
@70 = ~It's the truth. I thought you should know.~
@71 = ~(yawn!) You'll get over it.~
@72 = ~I had gotten my hopes up, seeing you. Please find them! I cannot bear not knowing where they are!~
@73 = ~You have? I... dare not ask what it is. Whatever you do, free my children and I will be forever grateful. If they are well, I must see them!~
@74 = ~NP: And I don't blame you. Of course, you couldn't ask you to do that. But... There must be a way to save them! Can't you... get into his base, or where Baram lives? I don't know, kick the door... Just find them, I beg you!~ /*Can you not... sneak into his base, or wherever Baram is? Break the door down, I don't know... just find them, I beg you!*/
@75 = ~When you find out more, please tell me. If they are truly safe, I cannot bear to be apart from them! You must rescue them, I beg you!~
