@0 = ~This camp is a mess! Uthgardt savages up on the plateau and morons wandering the streets.~
@1 = ~You may not be the swiftest soldier in the camp, <CHARNAME>, but you sure know how to get the job done.~
@2 = ~I hear the Luskan army is run by mages from the Arcane Brotherhood. It's a good thing we've got a powerful spellcaster like you on our side.~ 
@3 = ~(sigh) I'd take you back to my bunk, handsome, but heroes like you are too valuable to be locked away in the bedroom during times like these.~
@4 = ~Everyone's talking about everything you've done for Neverwinter, <CHARNAME>... but they don't mention how beautiful you are!~ 
@5 = ~You must be one of those mercenaries Gend has hired to search for the Words of Power. I wish you luck.~
@6 = ~Word is Aarin Gend has you searching for the Words of Power, <CHARNAME>. Too bad - we could use a good <MANWOMAN> like you up on the front.~ 
@7 = ~I'm shipping off to the front tomorrow, <CHARNAME>. Maybe I'll get a chance to prove myself and become a hero like you!~
@8 = ~Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we're fighting for before we ship off to the front.~
@9 = ~My, my. Hello there, handsome. You come to save us from the big, bad Luskan army?~
