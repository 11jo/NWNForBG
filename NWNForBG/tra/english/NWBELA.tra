@0 = ~Why, hullo there, darling. Come for a bit of fun, have you?~ [NWBEL051]
@1 = ~What kind of place is this?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~This? This is a palace of pleasure, dear <MANWOMAN>. There are men and women who can take your mind away from the terrible world outside... for a time.~
@6 = ~How do I go about seeing one of them?~
@7 = ~They work here of their own free will?~
@8 = ~I can't say I approve.~
@9 = ~My name is Bela, darling. I keep my boys and girls safe and the customers happy. If you're ever unhappy, you come see me... I'll change your mind, you'll see.~
@10 = ~That's what you're doing already, isn't it? Ha ha! Nevermind me... you go right ahead.~
@11 = ~Tell me about what's going on in Luskan.~
@12 = ~How can you run this place with all the fighting going on?~
@13 = ~Leaving so soon? Be careful, then, sweet thing.~
@14 = ~Ha ha! You would have to speak to one of them yourself, my dear <MANWOMAN>. If they have the time, and they like you... well, then the two of you can take things from there. All of my girls and boys spend their time upstairs. You can go up there, if you like. If you stay down here... well, do be careful around some of these men.~ 
@15 = ~Who are these men?~
@16 = ~Naturally they do, darling. There are far worse ways in Luskan to make a living than to spend your time surrounded by luxury and fine company. If you don't believe me, however, you are certainly free to ask them yourself. Just don't make trouble, that's all I ask.~ 
@17 = ~Ha ha! Well, my dear <MANWOMAN>, nobody said that you had to. The marvelous thing about a door is that it's as good for going as it is for coming, wouldn't you agree? Speaking of which... take a look at the rock on this here ring my latest beau gave me? What do you think, mmm?~ 
@18 = ~My goodness! It's huge!~
@19 = ~That's the good stuff!~ 
@20 = ~Big deal.~
@21 = ~Now you have me at a disadvantage, however. Might I know your name, hmm?~
@22 = ~I'm called <CHARNAME>.~
@23 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@24 = ~I don't want to give my name.~ 
@25 = ~My name wont tell you anything.~ 
@26 = ~You're not from here, <CHARNAME>, are you? I like that in a man. I may have to snap you up myself. But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.~ 
@27 = ~Err... pickles?~
@28 = ~I'll look around.~
@29 = ~Sweet name you have there, girl. Don't let the brutes down here know it, or you'll be hearing it in drunken ballads for hours. Trust me on that. But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.~ 
@30 = ~That is a mighty big question, darling. The simple answer is that the High Captains one day decided to see which of them would be the one and only High Captain and began to kill each other and the city. Boys will be boys, I suppose. I'm willing to bet that you want to know more than that, though, hmm?~ 
@31 = ~Tell me more about these High Captains.~
@32 = ~When did all this fighting begin?~
@33 = ~Isn't there anyone who can put a stop to it?~
@34 = ~I want to ask you something else.~ 
@35 = ~It's not like I have much of a choice, darling. The High Captains all want a place that keeps their men happy... so they make sure that we don't close down. And besides... a very happy soldier is a much, much better thing than a very unhappy soldier. You take my meaning, sugar? We still have to give most of our gold to each of the High Captains to keep the peace, but it's a better living than most these days.~ 
@36 = ~Hmph. Most of these brutes are soldiers for either High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram. They take after their commanders, as well, for they fight continuously. I declare, it is all I can do to keep them distracted enough not to tear each other apart and destroy my good home. It'll be far, far better for us all when those High Captains get it all over with and kill each other once and for all. Mmm... but perhaps I shouldn't talk so. What do you think of them, darling?~ 
@37 = ~I think I agree with you.~
@38 = ~I could not care less, one way or the other.~
@39 = ~I support Kurth.~
@40 = ~I support Baram.~
@41 = ~Listen, honey, goodness had *nothing* to do with it. But we're getting off the topic. You were busy disapproving, as I recall. Something else you wanted, then, darling?~ 
@42 = ~Don't get your leathers in a bunch, sweetie. When I say it's a rock, I mean it's a rock. Looks pretty, though. So did my beau, but I don't date cheap men. But we're getting off the topic. You were busy disapproving, as I recall. Something else you wanted, then, darling?~ 
@43 = ~It was a big deal... to my beau. After borrowing all that gold, I hear you'll find his tongue in Ten Towns and his toes in Athkatla. Sad story, I know, but you'll get over it. But we're getting off the topic. You were busy disapproving, as I recall. Something else you wanted, then, darling?~ 
@44 = ~Ooooh, a real charmer. I like that in a man. I bet you wouldn't pass out drunk before I even knew we were started, would you darling? But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.~ 
@45 = ~You got the manners, girl. You ever decide to change professions, you come and talk to me. Don't kid yourself: the jewelry is fabulous. But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.~ 
@46 = ~Dark and mysterious. Hmmm, you're giving me goose-bumps, darling. I should snatch you up for myself, mrrowwr. But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.~ 
@47 = ~Mmmm, the boys are going to love you, I see. Teach them manners and show them who's boss... you'll have them eating out of your hand, trust me. But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.~ 
@48 = ~It's for the gnomes. They like their pickles sour and their women tall. Don't ask me why.~
@49 = ~Don't get lost, then, darling. We once found a halfling in the cellar after a week, poor fellow. He was still smiling, but that's a different story.~
@50 = ~Well, let's see. There used to be five of them, naturally. Most of them have died off or run off... who can really tell anymore? Only Kurth and Baram are left, two of the nastiest fellas you never want to come across. It'll be far, far better for us all when those High Captains get it all over with and kill each other once and for all. Then me and my poor girls and boys will be safe.~ 
@51 = ~Hmm... only a few weeks ago. Has it only been that long? Yes, I think it has. Simply amazing. It was about the same time that we heard about the plague in Neverwinter, I think.~
@52 = ~Them wizards in the Host Tower could, I suppose. Looks like they don't want to.~
@53 = ~Tell me about these wizards.~
@54 = ~Sure thing, sugar.~
@55 = ~Now there's a smart <GIRLBOY>. I knew you were gold the minute I laid eyes on you, yes I did. You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She's one of my girls upstairs. Shhh... don't ask why, sweetie. Just trust me.~ 
@56 = ~Now there's a smart <GIRLBOY>. I knew you were gold the minute I laid eyes on you, yes I did. You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He's one of my boys upstairs. Shhh... don't ask why, sweetie. Just trust me.~ 
@57 = ~Ha ha! You must have walked into the city blindfolded, then! You go ahead and be mercenary if you like, darling... I like you that way.~
@58 = ~Me want asks something else.~
@59 = ~Oh? Well... to each <HISHER> own, I suppose. Kurth is, at least, a bit more civilized. Champagne still gets you drunk, though, sugar. You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She's one of my girls upstairs. Shhh... don't ask why, sweetie. Just trust me.~ 
@60 = ~Oh? Well... to each <HISHER> own, I suppose. Kurth is, at least, a bit more civilized. Champagne still gets you drunk, though, sugar. You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He's one of my boys upstairs. Shhh... don't ask why, sweetie. Just trust me.~ 
@61 = ~That Baram reminds me of a wee sneaky rat, he does... but maybe it's just li'l ol' me. You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She's one of my girls upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~
@62 = ~That Baram reminds me of a wee sneaky rat, he does... but maybe it's just li'l ol' me. You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He's one of my boys upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~
@63 = ~Oh, you know. Them Arcane Brotherhood fellas who live in their tower on the island. They're supposed to be powerful, but nobody knows much. I certainly don't. There's a bridge that goes out to their island, but nobody can cross it. And they don't come out here. So that's that, I guess.~
@64 = ~Hmph. Most of these brutes are soldiers for either High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram. They take after their commanders, as well, for they fight continuously. I declare, it is all I can do to keep them distracted enough not to tear each other apart and destroy my good home. It'll be far, far better for us all when those High Captains get it all over with and kill each other once and for all. Mmm... but perhaps I shouldn't talk so. What do you think of them, darling?~ 
@65 = ~Hullo, darling. This is a house of refinement, I'll remind you... we'll have no trouble, now.~ [NWBEL052]
@66 = ~Hullo there, darling. Do make yourself welcome.~ [NWBEL050]
