@0 = ~Here I am... the fool. My stay here... with the dead... has taught me more in a few hours than... than I deserve.~ [NWFEN241]
@1 = ~He's a traitor. Desther. I helped him, and then followed hoping his deception was a mistake. I thought he would... He will return! Won't he?~ [NWFEN242]
@2 = ~What you do, Fenthick?~
@3 = ~Don't play games! You are in league with him!~
@4 = ~Where Desther go?~
@5 = ~He'll be back! He couldn't lie! How could he lie?! All this time?! When people had their doubts... I calmed their fears... The blessing is a gift, I said. THIS MAN CARES, I SAID! I killed them... I killed them all by believing in him...~ /*He'll be back! He couldn't lie! How could he lie?! All this time?! When people had their doubts... I calmed their fears...*/
@6 = ~No... yes... I don't know! He'll come back! To help the people! The people... I calmed their fears... when they doubted... The blessing is a gift, I said. THIS MAN CARES, I SAID! I killed them... I killed them all by believing in him...~ /*The blessing is a gift, I said. THIS MAN CARES, I SAID! I killed them... I killed them all by believing in him...*/
@7 = ~NP: Unless-- Unless I help him and he comes back. If he comes back, it's not for nothing. I should have helped him. He deceived us. Betrayed us. But if I help him and he comes back to Neverwinter, then I can help them...~ /*Unless... unless I help him and he comes back... if he comes back then I was right... I helped them...*/
@8 = ~Do you know who he is working for?~
@9 = ~Why didn't he want us to have the cure?~
@10 = ~Where is he now?~
@11 = ~I must find Desther. What do you intend to do?~
@12 = ~I don't know. He is no Helmite. The true brethren of Helm's Hold are dead... murdered... just to provide him with a false identity when he came to Neverwinter. He says he is one of the "People of the Eye," a cult following the "Old Ones," but I can't tell anything else from his ranting. It's like he's a different person... he has to be.~ /*He says he is one of the "People of the Eye," a cult following the "Old Ones," but I can't tell anything else from his ranting. It's like he's a different person... he has to be.*/
@13 = ~What are these Old Ones?~
@14 = ~Has he shed any light on the purpose of the "People of the Eye?"~
@15 = ~The plague... he gloated that he was sent to Neverwinter to spread it! His masters wanted it to last as long as possible! They wanted us all to die...~
@16 = ~Desther spread the plague? How?~
@17 = ~But what initially caused the plague? What started it?~
@18 = ~Somewhere inside... trying to raise undead to fortify this place. He has few followers left, and no more are coming. He claims he is being cast aside. He rants like a madman. Murderous. Heretical. I don't know this Desther. How could he have hidden this from me...~ /*Somewhere inside... trying to raise undead to fortify this place. He has few followers left, and no more are coming. He claims he is being cast aside.*/
@19 = ~I... I don't know. I can't go back... not yet. You... you can find him. Find Desther. Make him recant. Make him say he didn't betray us. Make him say I didn't let people die because of him...~ /*I... I don't know. I can't go back... not yet. You... you can find him. Find Desther. Make him recant. Make him say he didn't betray us.*/
@20 = ~A court decide that stuff. Or maybe a mob.~
@21 = ~Aribeth is waiting for you. Waiting for an explanation.~
@22 = ~Why shouldn't I kill you right now?!~
@23 = ~He won't say... he is fanatical... raving... like he wants his blasphemies to wash out the Helmite words he let me believe... Whatever these Old Ones are, they have abandoned him. He screams that he deserves protection, but none is coming. Whatever his purpose was, it is over now.~ /*Whatever these Old Ones are, they have abandoned him. He screams that he deserves protection, but none is coming. Whatever his purpose was, it is over now.*/
@24 = ~He rants about everything, but I can't make sense of it. They are fanatics... insane... they must be. Why else would all this have happened?~
@25 = ~NP: It's... These blessings... THESE BLESSINGS. contagious. vile. Every blessing given by him or his Helmites was contagious.... He could poison the harbors as well... The entire water supply... But the blessings gave false hope, so that people despaired much more when they did catch the plague.~ /*He could have poisoned the harbors... the whole water supply... but the blessings raised false hopes, so people would be even more desperate when they finally did get the plague.*/
@26 = ~I don't know... Desther was only sent to Neverwinter after the plague started. Whoever his masters are, I don't think they were prepared at the time. Desther just says he was supposed to prolong it... to stop our cures. There's something about the way it kills people... something they wanted to last as long as possible.~ /*Desther just says he was supposed to prolong it... to stop our cures.

@27 = ~I suppose it will come to that. I will wait for that judgment. I swear it. I will wait here. There's nothing else I can do...~
@28 = ~NP: No, I can't go. Ð¯... I can't. I can't look into the eyes of my beloved. my Aribet. Leave me alone. I'll stay here, waiting for the guards. I swear. But I can't look at her. I can't.~ /*Leave me... I'll wait for the guards... I swear it... but I can't see her... I can't.*/
@29 = ~I... I don't know. There's nothing I could do except... except try to help. If he recants, everything will be fine... Leave me... I'll wait for the guards... I swear it... There's nothing else I can do...~ /*I... I don't know. There's nothing I could do except... except try to help. If he recants, everything will be fine...*/
@30 = ~Such cruelty... carefully designed to destroy our wills... and I trusted him. Made other people trust him... their deaths are on my hands too...~
@31 = ~All those people... and I let him do it. I made people trust him.~
@32 = ~I followed Desther to help him... so he could prove that he was worth trusting. I followed... to save my conscience...~ [NWFEN269]
