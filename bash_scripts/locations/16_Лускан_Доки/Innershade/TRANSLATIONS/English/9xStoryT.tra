@0    = ~Hello, my <LADYLORD>. I've never seen you here, in Innershade. You must be new here. I'm Little Bud and this is my hut. I made it all by myself! Do you like our village? It's nice, isn't it? (The child appears to be poor and dirty, but also quite clever and with good manners.)~
@1    = ~Where are your parents? You appear to be... not too rich... Take this coin.~
@2    = ~So, how do you make a living, Buddy?~
@3    = ~Can you tell me something interesting?~
@4    = ~I see. Well, I have to go. Goodbye, Bud.~
@5    = ~Oh, it's you again! Hello to you! I hope you'll enjoy your stay in Innershade! (The child smiles.)~
@6    = ~You live here on your own, don't you? That's sad. Here, take this gold coin.~
@7    = ~So, how do you make a living, Buddy? I'd like to know.~
@8    = ~Can you tell me something interesting? I'm bored.~
@9    = ~I see. Well, I have to go. Goodbye, Bud. Take care!~
@10   = ~I'm sorry, my <LADYLORD>, but I want to earn your coin. My parents died, but I don't like it when someone gives me money because they feel sorry. If you want, I can tell you one of the many stories I've heard. Then, I'd gladly take the coin!~
@11   = ~Well, tell me a story, then! (Smile.)~
@12   = ~I won't force myself to listen to your babbling, and then pay for it. No way!~
@13   = ~Is this how you live?~
@14   = ~All right! (He smiles.)~
@15   = ~Well, Patric, Eva and Strongheart give me some food from time to time, I talk with them, and when they offer me work I can do, I just help. They're very kind to me.~
@16   = ~Other than that, I tell stories. I heard them from many different people, though I found some of them by reading a lot of books. I take one gold coin for each story I tell.~
@17   = ~Well, I'd like to listen to one of those stories, little Bud.~
@18   = ~Take this coin, but I don't want to listen to any of your tales.~
@19   = ~Sorry, but I have to go now.~
@20   = ~Of course! It's my job. I'm a storyteller. I'll tell you one story for a single golden coin, my <LADYLORD>.~
@21   = ~Great. Tell me one of your stories, then.~
@22   = ~I'm not interested. I have to go now.~
@23   = ~Goodbye then. Visit me if you want to hear an interesting story.~
@24   = ~I see. Well, I'll be here if you need anything.~
@25   = ~So, I can tell you about many things. About the name of this village, 'bout villagers, the tale of the Clearings Beneath, about the riddle of the genie, about enchanted butterflies... Well, I also heard about what happened on the Sword Coast during the last year. What else... let me think a bit... Oh, maybe the Wall of Grinning Skulls? About the Endless Well? The last story I can offer you is a sad one. About a plague in a faraway village.~
@26   = ~Tell me about the name of this village: Innershade.~
@27   = ~I'd like to know something about the villagers.~
@28   = ~I'd like to listen to the tale of the Clearings Beneath.~
@29   = ~The riddle of the genie sparks my curiosity.~
@30   = ~The enchanted butterflies? That may be interesting.~
@31   = ~News from the Sword Coast? What about it?~
@32   = ~Tell me about the Wall of Grinning Skulls, Buddy.~
@33   = ~The Endless Well? I want to hear about it.~
@34   = ~The plague in the distant land has me interested. I'll give it a shot!~
@35   = ~Sorry, I don't have a single coin. Maybe next time! Bye!~
@36   = ~You see, practically none of the villagers ever heard this tale. This village is quite new. There are only a few houses, some huts... not even enough for thirty people. However, there are two aspects that have never changed: the tower in which Patric decided to live, and the mine of crystals beneath this village. So, I heard that a witch used to live in the tower. I don't know if she was a good one, or a vicious hag, though. She used to visit the crystal caves. Some versions of the tale say she used to cry there, some say she did some kind of research. She had left something there and fled the forest, and never came back. No one knows what it was. However, the crystal mine is the 'inner shade' of this village. The name of the village is connected with the glow of the crystals and the tale about the witch. I don't know when the witch lived here... maybe centuries ago, maybe decades. That's all I know about the name and the witch.~
@37   = ~About the villagers? Well, I thought you'd probably prefer more interesting stories, full of magic and mysterious events. Who should I start with? Probably Patric. He's our village's resident priest and mage. We never made him our mayor or leader, but he's something like that. He really cares about Innershade. He's interested in every single part of our home. Sometimes, he visits my hut and gives me some warm soup. We also have a blacksmith here: Eva. She's very moody, but kind inside. She has a good heart. She makes really fine weapons and armor. She argued with Strongheart, the woodchopper here. Strongheart lives a stone's throw away from here. He's a strong man! I want to be like him when I grow up. Once, I saw him doing some funny stuff with a woman, but I promised that I'd keep it to myself. Don't tell him that I told you about that! He and the woman were so funny, however a bit naked. He... he's a bit hairy, you know? Are all men like that? Will I have such funny curly hair on my chest, too? Oh, I shouldn't bother you with these kinds of questions.~
@38   = ~You can also meet Innershade's main miner. He lives near the mine's entrance. Barbara lives near Patric's tower. She's such a kind old lady! I really like her! She makes delicious biscuits. Visit her... maybe she'll make some for you! The witch-doctor and medicine man of Innershade is quite a busy man, so he's not always in the village. If he's here, you can find him north of here, near the strange plants. Those are the most important people of Innershade. Hope I helped you a bit!~
@39   = ~I really like this tale: Once, a drunk man told me about a strange land under the world we know. There are many colorful plants there, many kinds of rainbows, streams of cold magma... and many fascinating creatures live there! The man said there are dragons, fairies, and a man who looks like he was burning, but was really just dancing. The land is surrounded by stony walls, and no one can visit the place or escape from it. Well, it's probably just the drunk man's own imagination, because the walls would keep him inside if he had really seen this clearing, but still... it sounds like an interesting place! Imagine those colors, the creatures... I'm sure they're all smiling and having fun all the time! I wish I had the chance to live in that kind of world!~
@40   = ~You know what a genie is, don't you? It's a creature who lives in a lamp, knows how to use magic, and usually has a bare chest. I really don't understand why... Don't they feel cold? I don't know. Sometimes they wear only some pieces of rags as a shirt, but even then, most of their chest is bare... Strange creatures. People say those genies can grant wishes, but they always want something in exchange. A sailor who visited Innershade said he heard about a genie who's making a research of the people's mentality and beliefs. The man said this genie lives on a kind of pirate island, under a huge mansion, but that from time to time, he visits the harbor. He can do really great things, but as payment, he wants some answers. He asks some kind of riddles and questions... I was thinking a bit about that. You know, maybe he wants to become a human? I don't have any other idea. Maybe he's fed up with being a genie, granting wishes, and using magic. I suppose everyone wants to be someone else from time to time!~
@41   = ~You know, I once read about a special kind of butterfly made by some kind of sorceress. She wanted to create a perfect magical creature, and after some research, she decided that this creature would be a butterfly. She filled her whole house with all kinds of butterflies. Her experiments took her more than a year, but she was determined. She was trying and trying, and one day she succeeded: she made a butterfly enchanted in silver. Wherever it appeared, it left a trail of shiny silver dust behind. It had magnificent power. It could resurrect, heal, kill, create illusions, but what the dust did exactly was based on this creature's instinct. The most strange thing was that the butterfly never killed anyone. This creature seemed to not use the magic it was given, just as though it never wanted that kind of power. Only in the beginning did it use the power. The sorceress decided to create another butterfly, but it was the same. They were dying, they didn't want to use the power and didn't resurrect the butterflies that had already died. After few weeks, only one butterly remained. The woman decided to turn it into a silver brooch as a symbol of her creation, but all in all, she couldn't control its power in any way. I think it's a great story. The story doesn't say if the brooch had any kind of magical abilities. Maybe I'll find that brooch one day! I'll surely look for it.~
@42   = ~You know, many things happend on the Sword Coast during the last year. Someone called <CHARNAME> brought back peace to the whole land. I know more or less the entire tale of <PRO_HISHER> path to glory. You know what people say? That <PRO_HESHE> is a Bhaalspawn! <PRO_HESHE> lived in Candlekeep for a long time. It's a little citadel on the cliffs; it's like a really, really big library. The Bhaalspawn traveled to all the neighboring cities, villages and towns: visited Beregost, saved Nashkel, and finally, Baldur's Gate. Even small communities like Gullykin welcomed <CHARNAME>. <PRO_HISHER> main enemy was a man called Sarevok. He was some kind of important guy in Baldur's Gate. He wanted Baldur's Gate and Amn to fall into war. <CHARNAME> and Sarevok are said to have fought in some kind of dungeons under Baldur's Gate. Of course, you know who won!~
@43   = ~This <CHARNAME> must be very strong. I want to be like that in the future! I will become a smart and skilled adventurer!~
@44   = ~I heard that deep in this forest used to be a Wall of Grinning Skulls. In the forest, there was a little inn near the road, but almost no one visited that place. Well, it was really deep in the forest. They had a customer maybe once or twice in a few days, but none of them ever left the inn. The host appeared to be a murderer who was preparing some kind of necromantic ritual in the basement. He was building a big wall made of grinning skulls. He was killing all the visitors, cutting off the head and making a deep cut across the skulls. He's said to have taken off the skin with his bare hands. One of the rumors says that he used to make meal dishes from the brain, eyes and skin. That's the disgusting part of the story, though. Finally, the man was caught by the guards. One of his customers was a member of very important family. They started to search for the missing guy, and then they found the inn. The events that happened in there were discovered. I'm glad none of villagers of Innershade became his victim.~
@45   = ~I heard about a strange place with a purple sky, talking trees and where dreams are able to walk. When someone dreams, his or her mind gives birth to a new being. The entrance to this world is something called the Endless Well. It looks like a simple well, but much bigger. When you step into the bucket, the rope rolls off - like a really big lift. You know, like the one on the entrance to our crystal mines. However, you have to travel through a really chilling darkness, but after some hours, you will find the end. The world is very colorful. This story reminds me a bit of the other story I know - about the Clearings Beneath. But lets get back to this story. I also heard that golden rain falls in this place. After the drops reach the ground they create golden pools which, after the rain ends, become golden mirrors which are able to the show the dreams of a people who look into them. Then the person is able to find a dream of his own. If the dream becomes a real being, this person will be able to find his inner self. It must be a strange feeling to meet your own dream, and talk with it.~
@46   = ~It's a sad story. I heard that there used to be a village where no one knew violence, the place was really peaceful. It was a really cheerful place. It was like a surreal place of happiness. Even plants looked different there: colorful, as big as sunflowers, and with a beautiful scent. This place was ravaged by a horrible epidemic. Every villager who became ill started to cough... they fell into depression... their skin turned pale and their hearts started to rot while they were still alive. The process of dying was long and painful. The place changed from a dream into a horrible nightmare. All the flowers died, the trees lost their leaves, animals died or left the area. Before clerics who could stop the epidemic came, all the villagers had died. Well, maybe not all: two or three people survived. It was a coincidence that those people didn't lose their lives. Clerics took them away from the village. When there was no one in the whole area, they burned all houses, plants and bodies with their divine magic. Nothing was left. The ideal place turned into a desert or nightmare. I don't know what else to call the place. I hope that kind of tragedy will never happen again.~
@47   = ~I hope you enjoyed the story. Do you want to hear another one?~
@48   = ~Yes.~
@49   = ~No, thank you. I have to go. Bye!~
