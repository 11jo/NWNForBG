@0 = ~What is it, <PRO_GIRLBOY>? Make it snappy. Haven't got all day.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Go on, then. I could stand to gab for a moment or two, aye.~
@5 = ~Maybe you could tell me about some recent events.~
@6 = ~Do you know anything of interest about Blacklake?~
@7 = ~MT: Heh, most of the local rich people in the area call me simply: cleaning lady. Although it wasn't always like that. At one time I had a good name, just right for my appearance. The city pays me something to keep this area clean, it pays quite enough. Yes, I still take laundry from neighbors.~ /*Heh, most o' the rich folk round these parts jus' call me the Cleaning Lady. Weren't always so, of course. Once I had me a pretty name to match me face.*/
@8 = ~So you've been in every house in the area?~
@9 = ~So... what, exactly, do you clean?~
@10 = ~I thought only nobles lived in Blacklake.~
@11 = ~Run off, then, an' leave an old woman to 'er work.~
@12 = ~I might. What events are you referring to?~
@13 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@14 = ~Have you heard anything about strange creatures in the area?~
@15 = ~MT: I would like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@16 = ~I gets around the district a bit, an' hears odd things as an old lady does. What did ye have in mind?~
@17 = ~What kind of odd things do you hear?~
@18 = ~I'm looking for work.~
@19 = ~Are there any places of interest in Blacklake I should visit?~
@20 = ~MT: Well, not in all, of course, but, in general, there are so many of them here that there is no difference.~ /*Not every house, silly <PRO_GIRLBOY>, but close enough as it makes no difference.*/
@21 = ~Are there certain estates you don't go into?~
@22 = ~MT: Well, I'm kind of sweeping the streets around here, and keeping everything in order. Yes, I also earn a little money doing laundry in the neighbors. I also keep many houses in order. Not every house, but almost.~ /*I keeps the streets an' such swept around here. An' to get a few extra coppers I takes in laundry from the neighbours, aye.*/
@23 = ~MT: Oh, well, of course everyone thinks so, only it's not true. Here, in Chernozere, servants live, and all sorts of poor people. Well, just don't think that we are not grateful to those who live here, yes. If not for them, then we, the poor, would surely have all died from this plague.~ /*Don't think we aren't thankful for the ones that live here, none. If it weren't for them, we poor folk'd be the first to feel the touch of the plague, we would.*/
@24 = ~I've got family beyond them walls, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, one's that ain't caught the Wailing Death yet. I hears plenty about it. Why?~
@25 = ~MT: Have you heard any rumors of the plague around here? Maybe something weird?~ /*Maybe you've heard some rumors here in Blacklake about the plague? Odd things, perhaps?*/
@26 = ~I'm investigating the plague. Maybe you could help me?~
@27 = ~Oh, aye, there's plenty of odd beasts and more besides at the zoo, of course.~
@28 = ~MT: And other than in the menagerie, have you heard of any animals?~ /*So you not hear about animals 'round here?*/
@29 = ~Anything you can tell me about the zoo?~
@30 = ~I am listening.~
@31 = ~MT: There were troubles with Formosa, but everything has already settled down. Nothing much is going on in Blackzero now. What else do you need?~ /*There was some business with Formosa, but that's all over with. Nothing much happening in the Blacklake now.*/
@32 = ~MT: Hee hee ... I really need an assistant to wash clothes. I can even give you a coin... Hee-hee-hee... oh, never mind. What else do you need?~ /*Hee hee... I needs a hand with the laundry scrubbin'. I can spare a copper for ye, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Heh heeee... ah, don't mind me none.*/
@33 = ~MT: I don't know what to aim for<RACE> like you. Well, go to the &quot;Bare Board&quot; ... however, strange things are said about it. I've never been there. What else do you need?~ /*Not sure what a young <PRO_GIRLBOY> like you would like. Maybe go to the Board Laid Bare by the gate... 'tis got a strange reputation, they says. Never been there, meself.*/
@34 = ~MT: Yah you! Of course, you didn't see how I went to Meldanen's mansion and took laundry there, well, no, not that. You know, there was a time... Ah, but I shouldn't have to talk about such things. I'm already an old lady... now you better let me work in peace.~ /*Oh, my! Ye certainly wouldn't catch me going to Meldanen's estate to take 'is laundry, of all things, no no no. Mind you, there was a time...*/
@35 = ~Oh, go on. What were you about to say?~
@36 = ~Tell me about the wizard, woman, before you try cleaning without hands.~
@37 = ~Could I ask you some other questions?~
@38 = ~MT: Well... some people say that menagerie owners should kill all the animals. That they seem to be from Waterdeep or something. I don't know what they are from. The owner of the menagerie recently talked a lot with the city guards... They seem to know their stuff. What else do you need?~ /*Well... there's some folks who think the keepers at the zoo should be killin' all their animals. Somethin' about them coming from Waterdeep or somesuch.*/
@39 = ~MT: Yes, I havenâ€™t heard anything other than empty chatter ... everyone will tell you about it, you can be sure. What else do you need?~ /*I don't know anything other than all the babble... but ye could hears that anywhere, I'm sure.*/
@40 = ~MT: Er...they say the wizard Meldanen had a collection of animals, but I don't know if he still has them. In fact, you can't talk to him. They say someone put him in his place. There is nothing special going on in our area now. Do you need anything else?~ /*You can't talk to him, though. I heard he got put in his place by someone. Nothing happening in the district now.*/
@41 = ~MT: Why don't you go and have a look? These aristocrats, don't feed them bread, just let me show you something nice. It is in the north of the region. Do you have any more questions?~ /*Why don't ye give it a visit and see for yerself? Them noble types always likes to show off their pretty critters, they does. It be on the north end o' the district.*/
@42 = ~MT: Well... it's all about Formosa. Formosa, they say, stirs up the people in the square, persuades the wizard to fight. But in general, go ahead and listen, otherwise I can confuse everything. An area in the southeastern part of the district... and Formosa is there, you can be sure. What else do you need?~ /*Bah, best ye hears such things for yerself, I can't make no sense of it. The square's in the southwest part o' the district... and Formosa's there, no doubt.*/
@43 = ~MT: There were troubles with Formosa. but everything has already settled down. Formosa, they say, stirred up the people in the square, persuaded the magician to fight. Well, someone killed her, they say Meldanen took revenge. What else do you need?~ /*I s'pose not, at that. Formosa's been stirrin' up trouble at the square, they says, trying to turn everyone against the wizard.*/
@44 = ~Aye, if ye wish. I be in no hurry to continue me work.~
@45 = ~MT: Oh, that was a long time ago when I was a pretty girl. Meldanen was a young aristocrat, and such a handsome man! His dad, rest his soul in peace, did not approve of me, so young Meldanen secretly escorted me to the house, yes, it was the case. Hee hee! But that was long before Meldanen became a wizard and all. He doesn't need the poor old woman anymore, so that's all in the past.~ /*But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.*/
@46 = ~MT: But, if he secretly made his way there, maybe this entrance still exists?~ /*If he snuck you into the estate, perhaps that entrance still exists?*/
@47 = ~You might know some secrets about Meldanen, then?~
@48 = ~Nay, nay. They say it's best not to talk about the wizard, an' I agree. T'is of no importance, besides.~
@49 = ~MT: Ugh, threaten an old woman, how are you? Yes, it all happened and passed, and it has grown.~ /*Hey, I was just testing you. You passed. Well done.*/
@50 = ~MT: Er...they say the wizard Meldanen had a collection of animals, but I don't know if he still has them. If you want to talk to him, then go to his mansion. He just doesn't like visitors. Do you need anything else?~ /*Eh... they says that Meldanen the wizard keeps himself a collection o' beasties, but I don't know anything about how recent he got them.*/
@51 = ~MT: Yes, that's exactly right. Meldanen made a magical door leading from my own house to his estate. At midnight, you know, it opened. Now I have locked this door and forced it with a screen. I don't know if it's still open or not... I was hoping that Meldanen would forget about me.~ /*Oh, aye, that it does. Meldanen had a magic door put into me very own home which leads into his estate. It would open for me at midnight, ye see.*/
@52 = ~MT: Ah, it's been too many years. The wizard's secrets belong to him alone, and I know no more about them than anyone else. They say that there are a lot of strange creatures in Meldanen's estate, and I don't doubt it at all. He has always been like this. Even when he was young, he kept all sorts of worms and a terrible bird that ate raw meat. But I don't want to talk about it anymore, no.~ /*He were always fascinated by such. Even when he were young, he kept strange worms an' a beastie bird that ate bloody meat. But I'll talk no more about that, no.*/
@53 = ~MT: I was a pretty girl, and Meldanen was a handsome aristocrat. His dad, rest his soul in peace, did not approve of me, so young Meldanen secretly escorted me to the house, yes, it was the case. Hee hee! But that was long before Meldanen was a wizard and all. He doesn't need the poor old woman anymore, so that's all in the past.~ /*But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.*/
@54 = ~MT: If you want to use this door, then my house is almost in the very center of the area. Here is my key. Hold. Just make sure there is no mess. Trust me, I don't have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard, so I don't think there's anything to worry about. Open with this key and enter.~ /*I don't really have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard anyway, so I don't think I need to worry about you. Just use the key and go on in.*/
@55 = ~I am grateful. Take these ten gold pieces as a gift from me.~
@56 = ~MT: I no longer have the key. You will have to find it if you want to enter there. My house is almost in the very center of the area. Trust me, I don't have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard, so I don't think there's anything to worry about.~ /*I already gave out my key. You'll have to find it if you want to be going in there. My home be in the north end o' the district*/
@57 = ~Thank you, me <PRO_LADYLORD>... 'tis a fair amount of coin for a poor old woman to own. Ye're very kind.~
@58 = ~Aye, farewell to ye.~
@59 = ~You just stay right where ye are, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, so I can keep an eye on ye.~
