@0 = ~Thank the gods it's a friendly face. I sure didn't want to end up like those boys.~
@1 = ~Like who?~
@2 = ~Yes, the plague has taken its toll.~
@3 = ~NP: Well, you're safe now, so calm down.~ /*Well, you're safe now. Quit your crying.*/
@4 = ~The Sword Coast Boys. These undead are... they WERE the gang I was in. I thought they would look out for me, you know? I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!~ /*I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!*/
@5 = ~Who is Drawl? A zombie?~
@6 = ~Who are you to the Sword Coast Boys?~
@7 = ~What happened to Drawl's rivals?~
@8 = ~I wish it were just the plague. The Sword Coast Boys will do worse. These zombies were some of the gang I was in. I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!~ /*I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!*/
@9 = ~I ain't safe. They'll come back. Once a Sword Coast Boy, always a Sword Coast Boy... even if you're dead. I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!~ /*I wasn't having anything more to do with them, not after what happened to Drawl's rivals. Now they're all dead, and Drawl's some kind of monster!*/
@10 = ~No way, Drawl and his lieutenants are worse. I saw 'em for a second... they ain't lumbering or slow... They look really evil now. He was the leader of our gang, but I don't know who he's dealing with now. I bet he gave over everyone just so he could be powerful.~ /*No way, Drawl and his lieutenants are worse. I saw 'em for a second... they ain't lumbering or slow... They look really evil now.*/
@11 = ~Who did Drawl make a deal with? Who did this?~
@12 = ~I'm leaving. What are you doing now?~
@13 = ~Me? I'm Krestal. I was just one of the Boys. I'm lucky that I'm not important enough to come after. Plague or no, I'd be over the wall if I was. After what Drawl did to the others... and how they tracked Walters down after he left. I hope he's all right... I know Drawl's rivals ended bad.~ /*After what Drawl did to the others... and how they tracked Walters down after he left. I hope he's all right... I know Drawl's rivals ended bad.*/
@14 = ~Where are they?~
@15 = ~Some of the guys, they wanted to try and get the gang out of town while the plague was going on. You know, save their skins. Drawl was leader, and said everyone should stay. He said he had a deal that would make the gang really powerful. He wouldn't let anyone leave. Then he changed into... something. Now... everyone is dead... zombies, but different. And Drawl, he's still leading them. Don't know how... He's got a powerful friend somewhere.~ /*Then he changed into... something. Now... everyone is dead... zombies, but different. And Drawl, he's still leading them. Don't know how... He's got a powerful friend somewhere.*/
@16 = ~How did Drawl do all this?~
@17 = ~I don't know. At first I thought The Heavies had something to do with it. They're a gang of half-orcs, but now they are all undead too. They're all wandering around the warehouse. It's like Drawl put them on display, like with all his rivals... making a point.~ /*I don't know. At first I thought The Heavies had something to do with it. They're a gang of half-orcs, but now they are all undead too.*/
@18 = ~I ain't going anywhere! I ain't ending up like them... not even Drawl, if I can help it.~
@19 = ~The Sword Coast Boys? Drawl had them take over a warehouse as a new base. Don't know why he thought that specific building was so important. That was just a little while ago. It's in the north central area of the district.~ /*The Sword Coast Boys? Drawl had them take over a warehouse as a new base. Don't know why he thought that specific building was so important.*/
@20 = ~I tell you, he's got someone backing him. I don't know. Maybe... maybe it's got something to do with the zombies everywhere, and they wanted undead that still had a mind. Not sure why they'd want Drawl, though. I guess he's real easy to please. I don't think he cares what happens to him, just as long as he's the strongest guy on the block. I just hope he doesn't come looking for me. I wanna live a good long time.~ /*I tell you, he's got someone backing him. I don't know. Maybe... maybe it's got something to do with the zombies everywhere, and they wanted undead that still had a mind.*/
@21 = ~What are you doing? I don't want anyone drawing attention here! It ain't safe out there, not with Drawl and his Sword Coast Boys making like corpses. You guard fools can go risk your necks, but I'm not ending up like them... not me.~ /*What are you doing? I don't want anyone drawing attention here! It ain't safe out there, not with Drawl and his Sword Coast Boys making like corpses.*/
@22 = ~I don't have many answers, but it seems like the Sword Coast Boys are out of action. Everything's calming down in this district.~
