@0 = ~Hello there good <SIRMAAM>. How can old Janken be of help to you?~
@1 = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@2 = ~What is this place?~
@3 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@4 = ~Nevermind. Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I doubt you would be very interested in me. Not too much to tell, but I guess I could share a bit. I'm a druid and have been a member of this grove for about fourteen years now. I used to be the second-in-command around here. But I got tired of the responsibility, so I decided to focus on my fighting skills instead. I am now the defender of the second circle of the grove.~ 
@6 = ~What do you mean, the defender of the second circle of the grove?~ 
@7 = ~Aren't you too old for fights?~ 
@8 = ~This is the Neverwinter Wood grove. We are druids who have come together to study and protect nature. Of course my role here is a little different than that.~
@9 = ~What is your role here?~
@10 = ~Just couldn't fit in here?~
@11 = ~Nevermind. Goodbye.~
@12 = ~Aawill is the Archdruid. He has been here even longer than I have, though I still remember when he was much farther down in the chain of command. He has definitely earned his place of respect. He is looking into the attacks by the animals of the woods right now. Is there anything else I can help you with?~ 
@13 = ~What is wrong with the animals?~
@14 = ~I see. Goodbye.~ 
@15 = ~Well, take care then. Goodbye.~
@16 = ~Jaer, the very serious young woman over there, meets with druids who wish to either join or improve their standing in the circle of druids. She organizes challenge fights between the druid seeking improvement and the defender of the appropriate circle. I like that I don't have to worry about the details anymore; I just have to fight. When I was younger, that used to mean full frontal assault. Now I have more wisdom and I fight like a wolf; snap in and out, never leaving myself open.~ 
@17 = ~Not that the animals in this wood are fighting with intelligence, but that's another subject entirely. Do you have questions you would like to ask about anything else?~
@18 = ~Can I challenge you?~
@19 = ~You know, I always thought I would retire and relax in some peaceful little cottage in the woods by this point in life, but the lure of one-on-one combat holds me here. I guess it just makes me feel more alive.~
@20 = ~So how does one get involved in this combat?~
@21 = ~Aren't you worried about getting killed in these fights?~
@22 = ~No, that's not exactly what I meant. Most people come here seeking to work with nature, but some find a different role to play. That's what happened to me. I love nature, and I was good enough to become the second-in-command. But I got tired of the responsibility, so I decided to focus on my fighting skills instead. I am now the defender of the second circle of the grove.~ 
@23 = ~The animals have attacked people who step foot anywhere near the Wood. I believe there is something wrong with the Spirit. Some druids have been sent to investigate the matter, but they haven't returned yet. You should speak to Aawill if you want to help. Aawill is the Archdruid of this grove. He makes all the major decisions and usually has more accurate information than the rest of us. Is there anything else I can help you with?~ 
@24 = ~Only the druids of our grove may challenge for admittance to the grove. Talk to Jaer if you want more details about it. Anything else?~
@25 = ~The fights aren't to the death and the loser is always healed. Even if I did die, and they couldn't raise me, I can't think of a better way to go. In a wolf pack, the dominant wolf eventually gets old and is beaten by a younger wolf. That's just life.~
@26 = ~I see you have returned. What may I do for you?~
@27 = ~I hear you've been talking to Aawill about helping the wood. I wish you luck in that endeavor.~ 
@28 = ~Nature thanks you for your deeds. Thank you!~ 
@29 = ~You killed Spirit of the Wood! The forest will never be the same. Go away.~
