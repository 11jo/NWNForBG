@3 = ~Nothing. Farewell.~
@4 = ~NP: Maybe. She's a lovely girl. She likes to have her feet wiped on the ground. I mean, no, not like that. *I like to wipe my feet on her. Ha! What's it to you? Did she send you to take care of it? Ha! I don't believe it.~ /*Maybe. She's a fine little bint. Likes it when you treat her like garbage. Oh, wait, no. *I* like it when I treat her like garbage.

Hehe.*/
@14 = ~You are just evil. I like that. I'll take it.~
