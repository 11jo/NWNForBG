@0 = ~You won't be allowed across the bridge without authorization, citizen. Please step away.~
@1 = ~Where does the bridge go?~
@2 = ~What kind of authorization do you need?~
@3 = ~I'll cross the bridge if I like.~
@4 = ~I have a pass right here. I am an ambassador from Mulhorand.~
@5 = ~Fine, I'll go.~
@6 = ~This bridge is the only egress onto the island where the Host Tower of the Arcane Brotherhood sits, <SIRMAAM>.~
@7 = ~The Arcane Brotherhood?~
@8 = ~Surely there must be some other way across?~
@9 = ~You need written permission by the Arcane Brotherhood themselves, affixed with their seal.~
@10 = ~How do you get such a thing?~
@11 = ~I wouldn't suggest it. Even if you got past us... which I doubt... there are powerful wards on the bridge. You need the pass to get past them. You can tries, if you likes.~ 
@12 = ~What?! Let me see that...~
@13 = ~On your way, then, citizen.~
@14 = ~Aye, an organization of wizards. Some say they rule Luskan, but if they do, they do so secretly. We rarely see or hear of them.~
@15 = ~Not hardly. The wizards protect their privacy with magic. You can't sail a boat to the island or tunnel there or even cast a spell to take you there... no passing, period. Not without their say so. That, at least, is what I'm told.~
@16 = ~(sigh) You don't. It's only given by the wizards to the High Captains and dignitaries invited to see them.~
@17 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@18 = ~Well... it's affixed with the seal. That's magical, so it can't be forged. Very well, then, <SIRMAAM>, my apologies. The Brotherhood have had quite a few dignitaries arriving within the last couple of weeks, but none from so far away. No matter. You may cross.~ 
@19 = ~You are free to cross the bridge, ambassador.~
@20 = ~You must be with the ambassador from Mulhorand, yes? You are free to cross the bridge.~
