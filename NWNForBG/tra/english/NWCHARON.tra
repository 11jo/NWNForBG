@0 = ~There are more people in the sewers than there is sewage these days. Er... not that these are the sewers. No sir! Aqueducts! Pure and clean! Please pardon my confusion. I'm still getting the hang of this new beautification program the city council put in place. The finer points of it seem to be giving things pretty names.~ /*Please pardon my confusion.

@1 = ~You know: sewers become aqueducts, waste becomes surplus resource, and my cushy job at the castle becomes tour-guide to the FREAKIN' SEWERS! BUT I'M NOT BITTER!~
@2 = ~Has anyone else passed by this point?~
@3 = ~Where do these Aqueducts go?~
@4 = ~Can you take me downstream?~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~Well now, actually there were a couple groups that I saw heading downstream. I thought it was a bit odd, but they didn't bother me. The first was just one man on his own. Older gent, and dressed in quite the finery. He looked like he knew where he was going. After him was a rough lot, and they looked like they had blood on their minds. Seemed a bit unsure where they were going, though.~ /*Well now, actually there were a couple groups that I saw heading downstream. I thought it was a bit odd, but they didn't bother me.*/
@7 = ~Well, they join up with the older sewers a ways down. There used to be some old storerooms back in there, but they ain't been used by the city for years and years. As the districts expanded, access to those old areas got built over. Not a lot of people know the layout of those old tunnels. I hear voices down there on occasion, though.~ /*As the districts expanded, access to those old areas got built over. Not a lot of people know the layout of those old tunnels.

@8 = ~Well, I can't leave my post here. An emergency might arise and my special expertise might be needed. IT COULD HAPPEN! I can send you down on your own. It ain't dangerous. Leastwise, I don't think so. Just say the word and you're good to go.~ /*Well, I can't leave my post here. An emergency might arise and my special expertise might be needed. IT COULD HAPPEN!*/
@9 = ~NP: Send me downstream.~ /*Send me downstream.*/
@10 = ~You sure you won't stick around? I found some hors d'oeuvres. I think they're little wieners. Uh... okay, bye then.~
@11 = ~Yes <SIRMAAM>, merrily merrily! Here you go.~
@12 = ~You're back again? Some people just can't get enough of the sewers. Aqueducts! I meant Aqueducts! Nothing sewer-ish about it! No <SIRMAAM>!~
@13 = ~I guess things will be getting back to normal. Just me and the sewers. Aqueducts! I meant to say Aqueducts! Pure and clean! Yes indeed!~
