@0 = ~I sense the stink of Tyr upon you. I hear that Oleff has you running errands? Maybe it displeases you? Care to hear an offer?~
@1 = ~I will listen. What is it you wish to say?~
@2 = ~Speak, but waste my time and you'll regret it.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Oh so polite. Bah! I have no use for manners. Can you steal and can you kill? That's what I need.~
@5 = ~I do what needs to be done. What is your offer?~
@6 = ~I do not commit evil acts!~
@7 = ~Ahh, you answer rude and rough. Are you what I need? Can you steal and kill? Or are you an indignant lackey of Tyr? We shall see.~
@8 = ~Off you go. Puppet. Dog.~
@9 = ~The "justice" of Tyr has a sickening grip on this city. Talona would like to see... something happen. Something that will shake the Tyrran faith. My name is Gilles. I need someone to act without conscience and despoil what the Tyrrans are trying to achieve. You see where I'm going? You were given a letter by Oleff asking you to find certain tombs and the artifacts within. The fool wants to strengthen the will of the people.~ 
@10 = ~I'm sure your quaint morality lets you sleep deep and long. Come back when you tire of being an errand <GIRLBOY> for Tyr and Oleff.~
@11 = ~These relics of Halueth Never could benefit the church of Talona, perhaps be warped to her will. And if not, they should be destroyed.~
@12 = ~You wish me to bring them to you instead of Oleff?~
@13 = ~Even in times of plague you scheme. How petty.~
@14 = ~Oleff and his brethren have no guarantees that these items will stop the plague. They just know they could prove powerful. This is a resource that must be denied them. Bring the items to me instead of Oleff and I will pay you far more than what he would've.~
@15 = ~Why do you think I am working for Oleff?~
@16 = ~What are the tenets of your faith in Talona?~
@17 = ~I will bring the artifacts to you instead of Oleff.~
@18 = ~I have no interest in this.~
@19 = ~Talona is her most active while people languish beneath disease. That is her domain, no matter if she caused the plague or not.~
@20 = ~I have eyes around the city. They say you carry a letter from Oleff, compelling his fellow Tyrrans to let you pass. What I don't know is whether you are helping for faith or just for the gold. If it's gold, I can offer more. It's that simple. Besides, I visited the dig in the Peninsula district. They need to hire outsiders like you. Their own brethren are falling like flies.~ 
@21 = ~You were at the tomb and didn't help the dying?~
@22 = ~The Lady of Poison revels in disease and all that corrupts the body. She is at her greatest when all others are laid low. That said... this plague is not her doing, though we are quite happy to accept tribute from people trying to appease her anyway. Talona is life and death in balance, but death is the stronger. She is to be worshipped and feared, lest she strike you down when you are weakest.~ 
@23 = ~Of course you will. You understand how weak those fools are, and how they don't appreciate you. I will treat you right. Bring me their "holy artifacts." They will be despoiled and twisted. Your evil intent is a welcome addition to our cause.~ 
@24 = ~Ah HA! But I have planted the seed, and you will think about it each time you are underpaid by Oleff. I will wait here. Think of your worth, and I will be waiting here.~ 
@25 = ~Well, I helped myself to some of their belongings. Got a fine quill off one of them. Jacob was his name, I think. He won't be needing it. I assume he's dead. He didn't react much when I rolled him over to go through his pockets.~ 
@26 = ~That's despicable! Give me Jacob's quill NOW!~
@27 = ~Take this path and I'm gone for good, fool! Walk in their shadow or walk with me! Either way, this is never mentioned again! Choose!~
@28 = ~Give me the Quill now, you evil bastard!~
@29 = ~Hmph! Puppet! Peon! Shove your trinket, your morals, and your blind righteousness where the light of Tyr doesn't shine!~
@30 = ~Go on with you, I got no reason to talk and you've got no reason to ask.~
@31 = ~Hello again. Is there something you require? I hope you are not attracting attention to me for no reason. Have you found any of the Halueth Never artifacts? The followers of Talona long for them. Tyr will not have his trinkets.~ 
@32 = ~I have an artifact from one of the tombs.~
@33 = ~Go over what is needed again.~
@34 = ~Yeah yeah, I'll look into it sometime.~
@35 = ~Well hand it over, fool! I'm not paying for your oh so eloquent words!~
@36 = ~Describe the recovery of the Ancient Chronicles of Never.~
@37 = ~Describe the recovery of Halueth Never's rusted armor.~
@38 = ~Describe the recovery of the ancient Holy Symbol of Tyr.~
@39 = ~I suppose it was fate.~ 
@40 = ~You were given a letter by Oleff asking you to find certain tombs and the artifacts within. The fool wants to strengthen the will of the people. These relics of Halueth Never could benefit the church of Talona, perhaps be warped to her will. And if not, they should be destroyed. Oleff and his brethren have no guarantees that these items will stop the plague. They just know they could prove powerful.~ 
@41 = ~This is a resource that must be denied them. Bring the items to me instead of Oleff and I will pay you far more than what he would've.~
@42 = ~Don't pester me unless you have news of benefit to the followers of Talona! Do not tempt her wrath!~
@43 = ~Self-indulgent tripe! These chronicles will make fine kindling at the next gathering of malagents at Daernuth. What a festival that shall be!~
@44 = ~The very shell that Halueth Never wore! The stink of him is thick inside it. My masters shall see that it is put to good use. Perhaps we'll forge it into a shovel and make a gift of it to the city stables. That would be fitting.~ 
@45 = ~Well now, wouldn't Oleff like to get his hands on this, hmm? I shall see that it is... properly disposed of.~
@46 = ~Here, your pay is 600 gold. That is far more than what Oleff would pay, and I may give even more! A triumph! Forever a void in their knowledge of Halueth! Such a triumph for the Lady of Poison, but there is still more to find. There are further artifacts. Bring them to me and I shall reward your black soul with gold to bathe in! And more when they are all delivered!~ 
@47 = ~A victory! Tyr shall never know these things! Whatever the future brings, Talona shall always have this sweet spiteful victory! Take this additional 600, and know that Talona may spare you. That is all that can be asked!~
@48 = ~Here, take 200 gold. That is, if you deserved it! You allowed other of these artifacts to be returned to Oleff! Perhaps you were trying to spare your conscience, but it will do no good. I will see that the followers of Talona use what we have already been given to torment the fools of Tyr. Get out of my sight.~ 
@49 = ~The Lady of Poison will not suffer these distractions. Get to your task!~
@50 = ~What in the Hells do you want? What reason would I have to speak with you?~
@51 = ~You have served well, but the followers of Talona are done with you. Leave me be.~
@52 = ~How did you know of the artifacts to begin with?~
@53 = ~Someone, after all, has already delivered the remainder of those disgustingly pure Tyrran artifacts to Oleff. Oh yes, I have spies even there! Did you think you could return to me and expect accolades for allowing this to happen? Are you a fool? Bah! Get out of my sight!~ 
@54 = ~I have eyes all over the city. Besides, I visited the dig in the Peninsula district. They need to hire outsiders like you. Their own brethren are falling like flies.~ 
@55 = ~You were there and didn't help the dying?~
@56 = ~What in the Hells do you want? What reason would I have to speak with you?Someone, after all, has already delivered the remainder of those disgustingly pure Tyrran artifacts to Oleff.
