@0 = ~I bid you welcome, dwarf, for I see you are not of the clan that hunts us and destroys our trees. I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads.~ [NWARW055]
@1 = ~NP: Why did you seek me out, <RACE>? Is there something you want to ask me?~ /*For what reason have you sought me out, <PRO_RACE> one? Is there some boon you would ask of me?*/
@2 = ~NP: Why are the Dwarves at war with you?~ /*Why are the dryads at war with you?*/
@3 = ~What do you make of this amulet?~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~All right, dryad. Now it's your turn to die.~
@6 = ~I think I will go now. Farewell.~
@7 = ~NP: The Dwarves are impossible to appease. They're killing my sisters and cutting down our trees. It's like some kind of madness has taken hold of them. And sometimes I think you can't blame just the Dwarves. I don't tell my sisters this, but sometimes it happens. everything around me becomes hazy, like I'm falling into a dream.~ /*And yet sometimes I feel the dwarves are not solely to blame. I do not speak of this with my sisters, but there are times when... things are not clear, as if I am in a dream or nightmare.*/
@8 = ~NP: That amulet looks, uh. familiar. Like I knew it a long, long time ago. See the writing on the back? It's in a very ancient language. although I know what the words mean: "The wood and the forge have joined together to bring down the Overlord."~ /*See the inscription on the back? It is written in an old and ancient tongue... yet I know what the words say: "Tree and forge united, to overthrow the Master."*/
@9 = ~As you wish, <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. What wisdom I have I shall gladly share with you, though I know little beyond our endless war with the immortal dwarves.~
@10 = ~Immortal? What are you talking about?~
@11 = ~What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?~
@12 = ~We battle the dwarves each and every day, and it has made us strong with courage. We shall not fly from another fight!~
@13 = ~May the earth be ever soft beneath your feet. But travel with care, good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Danger is ever present.~
@14 = ~I have dark visions of me and my sisters unleashing our magic on the dwarves and revelling in the slaughter. I cannot help but wonder if we dryads do not sometimes succumb to the same bloodlust as our foe.~
@15 = ~NP: Have you always been at war with dwarves?~ /*Have you always been at war with the dryads?*/
@16 = ~I can sense that once this amulet held great magic. The power of nature itself was contained within. But it is cracked, and the magic within it is gone.~
@17 = ~Can you do anything to fix it?~
@18 = ~I sense that this amulet once held great power. The magic of nature itself was contained within. But the magic is now gone, the amulet is cold within my hand.~
@19 = ~Can you make it magic?~
@20 = ~This amulet conjures strange visions in my mind: half-remembered images of a time long ago, when dryad and dwarf alike served a terrible, cruel Master.~
@21 = ~Tell me more about this vision.~
@22 = ~NP: The horror of this war is that it will never, ever end. The dwarves we kill are reborn and come back at us with weapons, just as we are reborn time after time after each death. Thousands, thousands of times I have felt the cold steel of a dwarf's blade pierce my flesh, or their huge warhammer shatter my skull. And each time, I reappeared in that grove.~ /*The true horror of this war is that it can never, ever end. The dwarves we slay are reborn and venture forth to wage war upon us again, just as we are reborn after each and every death.*/
@23 = ~That's horrible!~
@24 = ~You are immortal! You get to live forever.~
@25 = ~NP: Forgive me, but I don't understand your question. I know nothing of this snow globe you speak of, and our world is what it is. We know no life other than this one, which consists of constant and endless war with the dwarves.~ /*Forgive me but I do not understand your question. I know nothing of this snow globe of which you speak, and our world is as it is.*/
@26 = ~NP: Я... I think not, though my memory fails me. But somewhere in my mind are images of a time long gone. A time when Dwarves and Dryads stood side by side and lived in harmony. We were slaves to a terrible master, a nightmarish spawn of pure evil. Dwarves and Dryads alike served this creature, and together we dared to rebel against him.~ /*I... I think not, though it is hard to remember anything else. But within my mind there are fleeting images of a time long, long ago. A time when dwarf and dryad stood side by side.*/
@27 = ~NP: Perhaps I could infuse it with earth and wood magic if it were intact. But the amulet is broken. It needs to be repaired before I can infuse it with magic. However, neither I nor my sisters are skilled in metallurgy. It is in the power of the dwarves, but they will surely attack you as soon as they see you, it is useless to appeal to their reason. I'm sorry there is nothing more I can tell you about this amulet.~ /*However, metallurgy is beyond the skill of I or my sisters. The dwarves may possess such power, but they will surely attack you on sight if you try to reason with them.*/
@28 = ~NP: Maybe... yes, I can restore the wood and earth magic in this amulet. Prepare yourself. It, uh. it worked. The amulet is intact again.~ /*Perhaps... yes, it is possible for me to restore the magic of tree and earth to this amulet. Prepare yourself.*/
@29 = ~Are you okay? Is something wrong?~
@30 = ~NP: I see, uh. a creature. Cold as death. A master. And what I see. it's all so foggy. I see an amulet. Yes, the Amulet of the Ages! Forged to kill the Overlord and free us from this existence. I remember! We stood up to the Overlord, dwarves and dryads together-- No, the memory is fading. The Overlord was too strong. the amulet cracked, his magic was lost, and... и...~ /*I see a... creature. Cold as death. The Master. And I see... it is unclear... I see... the amulet. Yes, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to slay the Master and free us from this existence.*/
@31 = ~NP: Our life consists of endless suffering and hatred. We experience the pain of death and the horror of eternal war, but there is and can be no salvation for us. I don't know how it happened, but I am sure that our existence is in some way wrong. But we know no other life. War, death, rebirth. a cycle that never ends.~ /*I know not how we came to be this way, though I know our existence is... wrong. But we know no other life. War, death, rebirth... the cycle shall never end.*/
@32 = ~But the memories are clouded and unclear, a trembling reflection in a muddied pond. Perhaps they are not even real, for it seems as if our war with the dwarves has raged since the dawn of existence.~
@33 = ~I'm sorry, the vision is gone. It... it as if some great spell has stripped the memories from my mind. I can tell you nothing more about the amulet or the Master we once served. I'm sorry.~
@34 = ~Maybe I could free you from this Master.~
@35 = ~NP: We only dream of death as our only release. Perhaps if you kill the Overlord, we can be reconciled... but it's also possible that the Overlord is already dead. Even now, I can't remember... The magic is too strong. I'm sorry, but the memories triggered by the amulet are gone. I can't even remember the Master's face. There's nothing more I can tell you.~ /*The only release we seek is death. Perhaps, if you could slay the Master we could find peace... but it may be the Master is already dead. Even now I cannot remember...*/
@36 = ~NP: I am Arvil, ruler of the dryads. Welcome, <RACE>. Your courtesy amazes us. We are used to dwarves, and they attack us as soon as they see us.~ [NWARW056] /*I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads. I bid you welcome, <PRO_RACE> one. Your kind is strange to us - we are used to seeing only the dwarves who attack us on sight.*/
@37 = ~I bid you welcome once again, <PRO_RACE> friend.~ [NWARW054]
