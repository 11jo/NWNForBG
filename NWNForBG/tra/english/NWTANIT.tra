@0 = ~Good day, ma'am. I am Tanith. I shall endeavor to make your visit to the Moonstone Mask a pleasant one.~ [NWTANI54]
@1 = ~NP: I will talk to you. And not just talk.~ /*I would speak with you... and perhaps more.*/
@2 = ~There's more than talking, right?~
@3 = ~Whatever, plaything. I'm not here to talk.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I am certain, my lady, that we shall have a fine time. Have you a Pass Coin? A formality, as I am sure our talk will be... enjoyable.~
@6 = ~Here is a Pass Coin. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@7 = ~NP: Here's the pass.~ /*Question*/
@8 = ~I don't have a Pass Coin.~
@9 = ~There's no need to be quite so.. gruff. Merely supply your Pass Coin and we will continue. I assume you will adopt a more pleasant voice?~
@10 = ~That tone will not do you much good here. A Pass Coin may purchase my time, but a line such as that is more at home on the tavern floor.~
@11 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time. Just remember to provide a Pass Coin. They are available from the bartender.~
@12 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.~
@13 = ~You listen well? Does talking make your "clients" more relaxed?~
@14 = ~Let's talk about you, and what you like.~
@15 = ~Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?~
@16 = ~Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers?~
@17 = ~Forget the talk. Let's wrassle!~
@18 = ~I must be on my way.~
@19 = ~NP: Great, now tell me about yourself. What's on your mind? Here at The Mask, we're all very good listeners.~ /*Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.*/
@20 = ~Well, I regret to inform you that I cannnot speak with you unless you have one. I'm sorry. See the bartender if you wish to purchase one.~
@21 = ~Important people are not often able to confide with people that care. I am a surrogate and a friend, if need be. Tell me, what bothers you?~
@22 = ~Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.~
@23 = ~Bemoan about how no one really respects you.~
@24 = ~Me strong. Nothing hurt me.~
@25 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@26 = ~Me? Tonight I am whatever you wish. I am a confidant and a friend, if that is what you need me to be.~
@27 = ~I'd find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.~
@28 = ~That's very selfless, giving of yourself like that.~
@29 = ~Where are you from? What is your story?~
@30 = ~What *I* need? Right. You do this to help others. Ha!~
@31 = ~Look, if you want someone to fight with, you can look for an adversary outside. I will not be baited into a war of words.~
@32 = ~If that is what you wish. I don't recommend it, but I will accomodate you as best I can.~
@33 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@34 = ~Shouldn't you be ashamed of working here?~
@35 = ~Such a lady. I would be open to that, <CHARNAME>, but let me first ask you what it is you expect. What my boundaries are.~
@36 = ~Just lay with me. That is enough.~
@37 = ~Gentle comforts are welcome. I'm not that tired.~
@38 = ~Make me tired. Real tired. Animal man.~
@39 = ~NP: What a lady! Gladly, but let me ask you, what do you expect me to do? How far can I go?~ /*Such a lady. I would be open to that, <CHARNAME>, but let me first ask you what it is you expect. What my boundaries are.*/
@40 = ~I understand. Rest ye well, my lady. I will watch over you.~
@41 = ~I'm certain that I can accomodate you, my lady. Follow me, and I shall douse these harsh lights.~
@42 = ~Well... I am quite sure that can be arranged. Follow me. Hold tight. Hang on.~
@43 = ~Do not take this the wrong way but... my lady, I will need just a bit longer to bask in your... inner beauty first.~
@44 = ~My dear, dear woman, I will be more than happy to accomodate you... eventually. Let's just... go a little slower. Gutter-talk can be had anywhere.~
@45 = ~That is your option, but I must tell you that you will have to purchase another Pass Coin to speak with me again. Do you still wish to leave?~
@46 = ~I'll stay a while, I think.~
@47 = ~I must leave. Farewell.~
@48 = ~NP: No wonder you feel this way. Many important people suffer from a longing that can't be replaced by anything other than their great responsibility. You can tell me everything. I'm not going to condemn or glorify your position. I am here with you - you can put aside shyness. You are honest with yourself, and you are following the path you have chosen because it suits you. You are a woman who knows what she needs.~ /*Of course you feel that way. Many people in power have a sense of yearning that just can't seem to be filled, despite their great responsibilities.*/
@49 = ~Nothing bothers me. I am strong.~
@50 = ~I am sure you are quite capable, but is your armor so perfect? Women in power are sometimes convinced that need equals weakness.~
@51 = ~Of course. Our time can be spent any way that you wish. Within reason, of course. Mood is so important.~
@52 = ~I understand. As a woman you may have been forced to hide your true feelings on occasion. I don't appreciate the tone of your comment, but I understand.~
@53 = ~In fact, I think I've just about had it with you. Take your problems with you when you go.~
@54 = ~NP: A lot of people who come here don't know what they want. I try to help them. I try to ease their worries. Some people just need an attentive listener. I try to show restraint and understanding that they may not find with the men in their lives.~ /*Some people just need a sympathetic ear. I try to show the kind or restraint and understanding they may not have had from the men in their lives.*/
@55 = ~I was raised in a home with five sisters. When I left, I didn't really fit in with the dock workers or loggers. I don't count that as a loss.~
@56 = ~NP: Look, if you want to fight someone, take it outside. I don't want to engage in a verbal duel. My job is to listen. If you don't trust my honesty, the door is right behind you. So, uh. What do you want to talk about?~ /*Look, if you want someone to fight with, you can look for an adversary outside. I will not be baited into a war of words.*/
@57 = ~NP: I will not tolerate rudeness.~ /*Me don't want troubles.*/
@58 = ~NP: You look like you are skilled with weapons, but you also have other talents. Such versatility and a taste for battle might scare off your friends. I can fill that void, if you wish. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are too.~ /*For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes.*/
@59 = ~Sorry, but Ophala want's no talk of that. Call a devil's name and you invite him in. We want the Moonstone Mask to be an escape.~
@60 = ~Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.~
@61 = ~NP: People despise women in this profession, but I'm a lecherous devil. That's their problem, not mine. If you don't believe me, there's nothing I can do about it. The door is behind you. You can open it and leave. Or you can stay.~ /*If you see me as dishonest, I won't be able to change your mind. The door is behind you. Feel free to use it. Or stay.*/
@62 = ~NP: I'm glad. Maybe we can talk some more.~ /*Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time.*/
@63 = ~Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers, my lady?~
@64 = ~Let's knock boots, honey!~
@65 = ~Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.~
@66 = ~NP: You're being rather rude. Rude. Perhaps you like to play with people. That could scare your friends away from you. I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you seem a roguish type. Irreverent. Perhaps someone that enjoys playing with people. Sometimes that can keep companions at a distance.*/
@67 = ~NP: You look like someone who loves the outdoors. It's a good occupation, but doesn't it alienate your friends? I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you look very in tune with nature. A good calling, but perhaps it keeps your companions at a distance?*/
@68 = ~NP: You seem quite devout, confident in your spiritual side. If your friends don't understand you, they may distance themselves from you. I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are too.~ /*For instance, you look very devout, and sure of your spiritual side. That can sometimes keep friends at a distance if they don't understand.*/
@69 = ~NP: You look like you know a lot of secret things. Maybe that's why you're lonely. Some people find that alarming. I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you seem very learned of arcane matters. Perhaps it sometimes keeps companions at a distance? Some people react with suspicion to such things.*/
@70 = ~NP: You look like you're skillful with a weapon. That kind of fighting might scare off your friends. I can fill that void if you'd like. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes.*/
@71 = ~This talk is over. Get out before I call the guards.~
@72 = ~NP: Of course, it's a lot of stress. So many people are counting on you, sometimes without even realizing it. It's a heavy burden. I can't help you in your affairs, <CHARNAME>, but you can pour your heart out to me. I expect nothing from you.~ /*Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don't know it. That must weigh on your mind.*/
@73 = ~I am sorry, m'lord, but my company is open to the ladies alone. You might wish to see if Tamora or Luce are available.~ [NWTANI50]
@74 = ~I really don't have the heart for this today. I don't need the criticism.~ [NWTANI51]
@75 = ~I apologize, but I am no longer working and my time is my own. I hope this doesn't inconvenience you.~ [NWTANI52]
@76 = ~NP: Ah, <CHARNAME>. You look well. I hope our meeting left you with fond memories?~ /*Ah, <CHARNAME>. You are looking well. I trust our encounter has left you with fond memories?*/
@77 = ~I enjoyed our time together. I hope you did as well.~
@78 = ~Me like you. Hope you like me a little.~
@79 = ~You just one more for the road. Ha!~
@80 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are ever the perfect lady.~
@81 = ~Your manner will never be a question with me, dear woman. Don't let your lovely simple heart be polluted. Ever.~
@82 = ~An unnecessary comment. I am sorry I could not draw a more genuine response from you.~
@83 = ~NP: Oh, it's you. You look good. I hope our meeting left you with fond memories?~ /*Ah, <CHARNAME>. You are looking well. I trust our encounter has left you with fond memories?*/
@84 = ~NP: Oh, you're quite the lady.~ /*<CHARNAME>, you are ever the perfect lady.*/
