@0 = ~Hello there! A grand day, isn't it? And you... you are to thank. It was your effort that allowed us to progress this far.~
@1 = ~You found the Waterdhavian creatures, allowing Desther and his Helmite brethren to concentrate on helping the spirits of the people. Now he can construct the cure and all will be well.~
@2 = ~I was happy to be part of the team.~
@3 = ~Desther will not create the cure alone. Others are involved.~
@4 = ~I did the important part. Desther sat on his hands.~
@5 = ~Yes, I knew you could be trusted, just as I knew Desther would prove critical. Even now he... well... let's just say he is helping, despite what others think.~
@6 = ~I realize that, but he has done so much more. I really don't expect you to understand the weight of his involvement... the risks he takes.~
@7 = ~I don't like your tone. You are just like the others. You don't realize the importance of what he has done.~
@8 = ~Misunderstandings have plagued him from the start. I've even had to... well... Suffice to say that it has been hard getting him the resources he needs.~
@9 = ~Even now, that kind of attitude keeps his hands tied. I have had to... well... Suffice to say, it has been hard getting Desther the resources he needs.~
@10 = ~Of course, of course. It is better that we look forward. In but a few moments we will have the cure!~
@11 = ~Why did you hesitate to tell me something?~
@12 = ~What will happen during this ritual?~
@13 = ~I have questions about your fellows.~
@14 = ~Goodbye.~
@15 = ~Can you believe it? In a few moments this great trial will be over. The plague will have a cure.~
@16 = ~But enough of this squabbling. In a few moments we will have the cure. This great trial is almost over.~
@17 = ~Oh, it was nothing, really. Something better left unsaid. It is a matter for Desther and I alone.~
@18 = ~You can tell me. I've proven myself trustworthy.~
@19 = ~Tell me or I'll rip your head off!~
@20 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@21 = ~The Tyrran priests have already begun the incantations. Aribeth, Desther and I will join them when we are all ready.~
@22 = ~Oh, I would not presume to speak for them. If you wish to know what they think, I'm certain they would welcome your questions.~
@23 = ~How is Lord Nasher faring?~
@24 = ~Will your relationship with Aribeth improve now?~
@25 = ~Yes, it is time that I joined the incantations. We are moments from the cure, I am certain!~
@26 = ~MT: Да, да, конечно, и я не собираюсь оставлять вас в стороне. Видите ли, Дестера не посвятили в планы церемонии. Его попытки помочь проигнорировали. Мои соратники хотят, как лучше, но они слишком недоверчивы.~ /*You see, Desther has been pushed out of the plans for this ceremony. His efforts to help are ignored. My companions mean well, but they are too untrusting.*/
@27 = ~Have you done something to help him?~
@28 = ~I don't know. I wish I could trust you, but this matter is perhaps best left between Desther and I.~
@29 = ~MT: Думаю, эта чума истощила все ваше терпение, друг мой. Я знаю, что вы не смогли бы причинить мне вреда, тем более, в самом замке Невер. Мы хорошо защищены, и стражники будут здесь через несколько секунд. Ваше поведение меня раздражает. Большинству из нас даже не дают спокойно выполнить свой долг.~ /*We are so well protected that the guards would be here in seconds. It's almost oppressive. It prevents the best of us from doing what we must.*/
@30 = ~As you will. What do you want me to say?~
@31 = ~We should have the cure soon after. I hope it will work on the advanced symptoms. There are so many people infected.~
@32 = ~What form will the cure take?~
@33 = ~He has kept his gallant posture throughout, though I worry for him. He will not show a need for help. He may be far weaker than he seems.~
@34 = ~MT: Что? Я не совсем понимаю вас. Конечно, мы все были заняты этой чумой, но я бы не позволил нашим мелким разногласиям уменьшить мою любовь к ней. Думаете, ее чувства изменились? Я не вижу никаких признаков этого, а ведь я знаю ее очень хорошо. Она всего лишь озабочена состоянием больных. Вы ошибаетесь.~ /*You think she feels differently? I haven't seen any signs of it, and I certainly know her well enough. She's just concerned for the sick. You are mistaken.*/
@35 = ~You keep secrets from her. That isn't a clue?~
@36 = ~Yes, it is best that I concentrate on what is coming. I will have to be very careful not to disturb the incantations Desther utters during the ritual.~
@37 = ~It's a small thing, really. I mean, he needs to help for the cure to work. He shouldn't be held back by suspicions now. He's proven himself.~
@38 = ~I have done what I must for the good of us all, and I believe all of my actions will be vindicated in the end.~
@39 = ~You should speak with the others. Each will have valuable insights into the ritual to come, I am sure.~
@40 = ~As I have said, some people just have trouble understanding matters of the spirit, even those that seem wise in every other aspect.~
@41 = ~You see, for the cure to work, he needs to draw magical energy from the Temple of Helm. It's apparently very dangerous... it might kill him...~
@42 = ~MT: Арибет и другие никогда бы не допустили такого, так что я посвятил его в суть охранных заклинаний, защищающих замок Невер. Но магия Хельма поможет нашему заклинанию.~ /*Aribeth and the others would never allow it, so I gave him my key for the wards protecting Castle Never. The magic of Helm will aid in our spell.*/
@43 = ~Is there precedent for this? Will it work?~
@44 = ~Desther has assured me that it is all very sound reasoning. It is a simple thing that will ensure the cure is as potent as it can be.~
@45 = ~Doesn't that leave the castle unprotected?~
@46 = ~Of course not. I would never endanger the castle. Desther will simply channel a little Helmite energy to help the cure be as potent as possible.~
@47 = ~MT: Нет никакой опасности. Охранные заклинания останутся, где и были.~ /*"Cast all the buffing spells you have."*/
@48 = ~What would Aribeth think of this?~
@49 = ~Aribeth... I love her dearly, but her eyes have been closed by the horror of the plague. I must do this for the good of us all. You will see.~
@50 = ~Greetings again. I can spare a moment, but we should begin the ritual as soon as you speak with everyone else. With my help, Desther will... well... it isn't important.~
