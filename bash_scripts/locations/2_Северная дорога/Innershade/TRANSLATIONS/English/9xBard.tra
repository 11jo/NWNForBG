@0    = ~Ah, another annoying puppy, I see! Oh, marvelous! This village is like a magnet for people like you, adventurers who think it is simple to make a living, and that this life is a great mystery. You are wrong, "my friend".~
@1    = ~You should spend just a month in this gods-forsaken village and you will realize what life really is. Work, dull conversations...bah! If only I could leave this place! I would even kill to get out of here!~
@2    = ~Well, I see you have a flute. I thought that bards were more optimistic.~
@3    = ~What are you talking about? Did I miss something? Or maybe you missed something. Something like... a brain?~
@4    = ~Oh, how clever! You think you are someone special, aye? You realize that I am a bard. What other kind of person would keep a flute? Oh, wonder of wonders! We have a genius here. There is not even a tavern in this place, no one who could even possibly know the difference between a ballad and a sonnet! This will make me go crazy one day, and I will end up eating my own book!~
@5    = ~Only trees, berries and ponds! And, of course, the flies, mosquitoes and beetles! Oh, and let's not forget the peasants and children, who are not even able to count!~
@6    = ~Well, you are a bit mad, aren't you?~
@7    = ~I think I have to go.~
@8    = ~Me? Mad?! I am not mad! The people of this so-called Innershade are mad! They suffer a walking madness! Oh, how I hate them!~
@9    = ~Maybe I can help you somehow?~
@10   = ~Well, I think I have to go...~
@11   = ~Why do you hate everything around you?~
@12   = ~I think you are the one who is idiotic here.~
@13   = ~Why do I hate... Is it not obvious? Because of their stupidity! They talk about the same things all the time and their every day is the same as the day before! There is nothing here! There is nothing in their faces! Oh, and nothing in their skulls!~
@14   = ~Eh, maybe I can help you somehow?~
@15   = ~Well, I think I have to go... See ya!~
@16   = ~You are idiotic! You do nothing but complain. You are as appealing as smelly manure.~
@17   = ~Yes, go! My words of wisdom hurt, aye? You know that I am right! And you are probably no better than the idiots here!~
@18   = ~You bastard! I will kill you! I have had enough of this! Hahaha! At last, some fun!~
@19   = ~Help me somehow? Well, perhaps you could... Give me twelve thousand gold pieces! That would be helpful!~
@20   = ~Here you are. Be happy with the money.~
@21   = ~I have the money, but I won't give it to you just like that. Do something for me, and perhaps I will give it to you.~
@22   = ~I don't have that much money! You are truly mad!~
@23   = ~Hmm... I think I have to go.~
@24   = ~Are you mad? Ha! Whatever! Thank you, stranger! You are quite odd, but still you gave me my freedom! Hahaha!~
@25   = ~So why are you even talking to me?~
@26   = ~Whatever! Leave me!~
@27   = ~Well, I can do something... I used to work in a school for bards. I can teach any bard a small but useful trick. I do not use this myself, because casting this spell is like a sacrifice, but still, if there is any bard in your group, I can teach him a very special song.~
@28   = ~I am a bard, so teach me.~
@29   = ~<PLAYER2> is a bard. Well, get teaching!~
@30   = ~<PLAYER3> will pick up the tune quickly.~
@31   = ~<PLAYER4> is a fine poet.~
@32   = ~<PLAYER5>, try to learn this song.~
@33   = ~<PLAYER6>, follow this man's instructions.~
@34   = ~I have changed my mind. I will go now. Goodbye.~
@35   = ~All right, then! Let's start this thing!~
@36   = ~(At first it is difficult for you to catch the tune, but within a few minutes it becomes easier. The melody is very chaotic, and when you sing it you feel a strange and painful energy that laces across your body.)~
@37   = ~I have to take a break now. I don't want to finish the song, for I don't like the effect. Now, when you come to that moment, end it like this. (The man utters a short syllable that sounds very much like a snake's hissing.)~
@38   = ~When the song is finished, you will be hit by electrical energy, but that same energy will cure all of your companions. I wouldn't use it myself, but still, I remember it from old times.~
@39   = ~Now I will say farewell. You will likely die soon, but well, that's no longer my concern!~
@40   = ~Come, then. I will show you how to do this.~
@41   = ~(Your companions join the mad bard. He starts to sing a strange song. While he's singing, you feel a strange energy in the air. Your friend looks at him and starts to remember the entirety of the music he sings. Suddenly, the bard stops. Then he whispers something you are unable to hear to your companion, who nods.)~
@42   = ~Well, I think that's all. This song will cause a sacrifice. Electrical energy will hit the singer and wound him greatly, but all other companions will be healed.~
@43   = ~Well, that was an expensive lesson for your companion, but now I have to go. I advise you to go, too. You should not waste precious time with mad bards! Hahaha!~
@44   = ~Stupid village! Gah! Stupid mosquito! Who gave you permission to bite me? I hate this place! Ah, it's you again. What do you want?~
