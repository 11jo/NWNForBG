@0 = ~You must have taken quite a risk to walk the streets of Luskan. With all the fighting, I have received little in the way of supplies and less in the way of customers... but I shall serve you as best I can.~
@1 = ~Can I see your merchandise?~
@2 = ~What kind of wares do you sell here?~
@3 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Aye, let me show you what I have. Stand away from the merchandise, however... I'll not lose more to thievery!~
@6 = ~To tell the truth, I haven't much... it's been weeks since the last caravan. I do have some odds and ends that the local thugs haven't seen the need to appropriate just yet, however.~
@7 = ~There's little else for me to do, so ask what you will of me.~
@8 = ~Have you heard anything about cults in the city?~
@9 = ~What is going on in Luskan?~
@10 = ~Aye, fare you well.~
@11 = ~No. Perhaps you could ask the priests at the temple of Tempus about that, however. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*No. Perhaps you could ask the priests at the temple of Tempus about that, however.*/
@12 = ~Going on? Well the fighting between all the High Captains should be obvious enough. No doubt you know all about that, however.~
@13 = ~No, I haven't. Tell me more.~
@14 = ~I see. Well, now... there were five High Captains once. Not long ago, they all began to war with each other right out in the streets. Odd business, especially with the Arcane Brotherhood not lifting a finger to stop it.~
@15 = ~Tell me about the High Captains.~
@16 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@17 = ~Who is winning?~
@18 = ~Well, let's see. Three of the High Captains have all fled... or been killed. That leaves two of 'em still fighting: Kurth and Baram. Each of them has their own little army and is tearing the city apart trying to kill the other, as I'm sure you can see for yourself. Rumor used to be that the Arcane Brotherhood told them what t' do, but that doesn't appear to be the case anymore.~ /*Each of them has their own little army and is tearing the city apart trying to kill the other, as I'm sure you can see for yourself.

@19 = ~They live in the Host Tower... over there on an island at the mouth of the river. They control the city... or, at least, they used to. Nobody ever knew much about them or saw them at all, so it's no surprise that nobody knows what's happened to 'em now.~ /*Nobody ever knew much about them or saw them at all, so it's no surprise that nobody knows what's happened to 'em now.*/
@20 = ~Who can tell? I know who's losing, though. The whole city. If you aren't being kidnapped and forced to join one of the High Captains' armies, you're being slaughtered in the street. By the time all this fighting is over, there'll be nothing left to rule. I hear Neverwinter has a plague... we should be so lucky!~ /*Who can tell? I know who's losing, though. The whole city.
