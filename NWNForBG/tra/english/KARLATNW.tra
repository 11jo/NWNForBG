@0 = ~Judge? Judge, is that you? I don't remember -- it's so hard to string my thoughts together one to the next...~ [KARLA050]
@1 = ~Are you Karlat Jhareg?~
@2 = ~Why do you sound so confused?~
@3 = ~Be at peace. I am the Judge you seek.~
@4 = ~Why is this tower so full of fire?~
@5 = ~Back to the grave, you undead beast!~
@6 = ~Yes. Yes, that's my name... It's been so long since I've heard someone speak it! The last one to do so was my... my brother...~
@7 = ~I just don't know whether or not we've spoken before. I live in a constant daze. Everything's come undone since my brother... since that night...~
@8 = ~Yes. Yes, I seek an end to this torment of unknowing! I do not even know if we have spoken before... Everything's come undone since my brother...~
@9 = ~Fire? I - I was doing research once, trying to find something... And I found it - I did but... then my brother took it from me...~
@10 = ~No, I have forgotten many things but not my power. The last time I used it was that night... the night my... my brother...~
@11 = ~Quint! Yes, it was him! He was responsible! He invited all the children of the village to his tower and he began to read to them...~
@12 = ~Tell me more...~
@13 = ~Get to the point.~
@14 = ~NP: It was horrible. Blood, blood everywhere. All the children dead, every single one of them. He went crazy, you know. My little brother went crazy. I got there too late. I chided him, and he fell down before me. He said he did it for me, just for me, out of love for his big brother!~ /*I arrived there too late. I rebuked him and he groveled there before me. He said he did it for me, all for me, all for the love of an older brother!*/
@15 = ~NP: I threw fire at him, but he ran from me and stole my most precious artifact, my phylactery, and used it in his own way. And now he's got us all stuck here like flowers trapped between the pages of the Book of Time.~ /*I unleashed the fire against him but he fled and stole my most powerful artifact, my phylactery, and made use of it.*/
@16 = ~I've got a few more questions.~
@17 = ~Will you give that as a written oath?~
@18 = ~I've spoken to Karlat. He tells a different story.~
@19 = ~This your journal?~
@20 = ~It was horrible... Quint killed the children and when I rebuked him, he wrested my phylactery from me, cursing us all to be trapped here forever.~
@21 = ~I have the time, Judge, if not always the memory. Ask what you will.~
@22 = ~A lich's phylactery, huh? Aren't liches evil?~
@23 = ~Why would Quint do such a thing?~
@24 = ~Who has the phylactery now?~
@25 = ~What about Lathander and the Guardian?~
@26 = ~All right, enough questions.~
@27 = ~NP: I've suffered too long, tormented by memory loss and that choking smoke. I'll be only too glad. Here you are: an affidavit signed by myself. Give them to the guard and proceed with the trial.~ /*If so, I yearn for it... Take my written oath of every word I've uttered here. Present it to the Guardian and stand in Judgment.*/
@28 = ~NP: Of course, it's only natural! Did you think he'd confess everything? Mad, racked with shame, how can he see things in their true light? I've told you my story. Let him tell his own. You're the judge, not us.~ /*Of course he does! Did you expect him to confess? No doubt in his madness and shame, even he no longer knows the truth of things.*/
@29 = ~Why yes. Yes, the hand is mine. What does it say? I have half forgotten...~
@30 = ~You tricked your brother into the crime.~
@31 = ~You sought undeath out of a greed for knowledge.~
@32 = ~You acted on the advice of someone named Belial.~
@33 = ~Nothing. It doesn't say anything of note.~
@34 = ~NP: I have half elf blood in my veins. Some of the elves, called baelorns, become lich to guard their families forever. I would have kept our family together if my brother had not destroyed it. But because of his interference, I became only half lich.~ /*I once had half-elven blood in my veins. Among the elves, some called Baelnorns seek lichdom that they might stand watch over their families.*/
@35 = ~If only I can recover the phylactery he stole, I can finish the ceremony and become what I was meant to be... It would free us all from this wretched place.~
@36 = ~NP: He was young and foolish, understood nothing of the art of arcane magic, knew nothing of the world in which we wizards operate... We make alliances with demons, and demons become our companions, but does that make us evil?~ /*He was young and foolish, with no understanding of the arcane arts, no understanding of the world in which we wizards operate...*/
@37 = ~Perhaps he performed the unspeakable act in an effort to earn my respect, my affection. Perhaps he wanted to prove himself before his brother.~
@38 = ~NP: Latander gave it to the Guardian, and she has been guarding it ever since. If only I could get it back, I would complete the ceremony I started and become what I was meant to be... That would free us all from this cursed place.~ /*If only I can recover it, I can finish the ceremony and become what I was meant to be... It would free us all from this accursed place.*/
@39 = ~NP: What good is the god of dawn if he imprisons us forever in eternal night? My brother prayed to him until he fell into madness.... The guard says that Lathander has no power to judge us, and meanwhile Quintus roams free in the village, while I must rot here in this wretched half-form!~ /*The Guardian may claim Lathander did not stand in Judgment, yet Quint wanders the village freely while I rot in here forever, in this wretched half-form!*/
@40 = ~Yes, my Judge...~
@41 = ~I... I needed the blood. It was necessary. Without it, how could I protect the village? It was a high price but it would have meant a bright future...~
@42 = ~That's all it said. Will you give that as a written oath?~
@43 = ~Is a greed for Knowledge any different than a greed for Love, a greed for Justice? Before you Judge me, Judge yourself...~
@44 = ~NP: Belial? I -- I'm familiar with that name... Yes, it was the name of the demon I consulted. He's the one who gave me the phylactery and taught me how to use it-- Well, the summoning room down the hall. Maybe he knows the truth!~ /*Belial? I - I know that name... Yes, he was a demon I consorted with. He was the one who gave me the phylactery and taught me to use it...*/
@45 = ~Of course. Is that everything, then? Do you want my oath?~
@46 = ~We await your decision, Judge.~ [KARLA051]
@47 = ~Greetings, Lady Guardian. Greetings, Judge.~
@48 = ~Our souls long for rest, Lady Guardian, and our hearts for justice.~
@49 = ~At last! What was stolen from me has been returned and I may finally shed this half-dead form!~
@50 = ~I made it quick, just a moment of pain. I was told that they would be returned to life as soon as I finished my ceremony but... I never finished...~
@51 = ~No!!! The phylactery is everything!~
