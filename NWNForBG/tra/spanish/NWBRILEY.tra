@0 = ~Y-you really shouldn't be here. I'm g-guarding this place, and I can't speak to you unless Oleff sent you to find the tombs of Never.~
@1 = ~What is this place?~
@2 = ~Who is Oleff?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~It is a holy place, but I cannot speak of it to you. Please, I guard this place for the church of Tyr. You should not be here.~
@5 = ~Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar. He directs the actions of we who follow Tyr. I can't allow access to anyone except those he has sent.~
@6 = ~T-thank you for leaving. This has been a difficult time for the Tyrran faith. I wish I was back in the Hall of Justice.~
@7 = ~I-I'm sorry, but you really shouldn't be in here. I'm waiting for word from Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar.~
@8 = ~I have a letter from Oleff. He sent me.~
@9 = ~Thank goodness you are here. The plague has not been kind to our number... but the work of Tyr must still be done.~
@10 = ~What can you tell me about these tombs?~
@11 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@12 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@13 = ~I'm sorry, but I don't see any letter. Maybe you lost it. In any case, I can't do anything for you without Oleff's written permission.~ 
@14 = ~The tomb we are in belongs to Miaslaznia Fairblade. It has been her resting place for a good many years, though I don't know exactly how long. She was a trusted friend of Halueth Never, so hopefully this place will hold clues as to where the founder himself is buried. This one is very close to the surface, suggesting it may have been moved at least once in Neverwinter history, but no records tell of it.~ 
@15 = ~What have you learned from this tomb?~
@16 = ~Where are the other tombs located?~
@17 = ~Did you find any artifacts in here?~
@18 = ~I have other questions.~
@19 = ~The Wailing has taken many, including my brethren that were digging here. Pity... they didn't have time to... well, I shouldn't speak of that.~
@20 = ~What a good looker like yous got to hide, hmm?~
@21 = ~I have been guarding this... hole for several days now. I hear nothing but the scuffling of feet above and the sceaming in my own head. I'm sorry, I wish I knew of mysterious strangers or odd groups. It would put my mind at ease, and give reason to all of this. For now, I just sit and hope that I'm not struck down myself. I must trust in the wisdom of Tyr.~ 
@22 = ~Another time. Remember to look at Jacob's journal in the chest. He may have included some valuable information before he... well. His blessed quill will have been put to good use detailing what they found... strange... the quill is not here...~

@24 = ~The plague killed every member of the team that was digging it out. What they knew, mostly died with them. There is a journal, though. The scribe Jacob was supposed to detail what they found, but I have not read his account. It is in the chest. You may open it.~ 
@25 = ~I don't know. Jacob's journal in the chest may say, but I was not instructed to read it, so you will have to examine it yourself. I hope it proves useful. It would be a shame for him to have died without having shared his knowledge.~
@26 = ~I don't think so. Of course, I only arrived after the team died of the plague. I hope no one had the gall to disturb their bodies. The journal in the chest may have other information, but I was not instructed to read it.~ 
@27 = ~I will answer what I can.~
@28 = ~I don't want to speak ill of them, but the transgression was not that serious. They sinned a little. They-- Well, they began to doubt Tyr's power. I guess these are the times when faith is tested. They consorted somewhat with the Helmites and accepted blessings. There are many gods, I know, and Tyr favors Helm well enough, but it didn't seem appropriate. Again, it's a minor sin. They did nothing wrong, and did their duty to the end.~
@29 = ~It's a shame they'll never be absolved of that sin..... But this does not really concern you. They have departed this mortal realm, and you have other duties to attend to.~
@30 = ~Please, do not touch that. I've been instructed to only allow access to someone sent by Oleff.~
@31 = ~Thank heavens you're here. I can leave my post now, farewell.~
