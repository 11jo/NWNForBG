@0 = ~NP: Hello! I've come from Neverwinter for help. A plague is raging in my city and it is clearly not of natural origin. Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher have sent me to Askatla to find heroes who can help Neverwinter. Maybe you can help?~ /*He intends to invade Neverwinter, of that I have little doubt even if I don't know what he's done in recent weeks. It's not power that he seeks specifically, however... something is in Neverwinter that he seeks.*/
@1 = ~NP: I'm not interested. look for someone else~ /*I'm not interested. Goodbye.*/
@2 = ~NP: Well, I guess I'll try to help. Where is this city located?~ /*I guess I will, at that.*/
@3 = ~NP: It is north of Askatla. If you are willing to help, I will teleport you to Lady Aribeth at Neverwinter Academy.~ /*I understand, Aarin. Together we will stop Aribeth and save Neverwinter.*/
@4 = ~NP: Not now~ /*Not just yet.*/
@5 = ~NP: Yes, I'm ready.~ /*I'm ready.*/
@6 = ~NP: Well, I'll be waiting for you here.~ /*What can I do for you?*/
@7 = ~NP: Then get ready, now you will find yourself in the Neverwinter Academy. Lady Aribeth will explain everything to you in detail.~ /*Perhaps if you go to the Neverwinter Woods, a clue or two will reveal itself.*/
@8 = ~NP: You're back. Does this mean that you will help us?~ /*You've come back? Er... what do you wish of me?*/
