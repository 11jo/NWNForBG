@0 = ~It's good that ye've decided t' speak with me. Me name be Baram, the one an' only true High Captain of Luskan. Ye'll have t' excuse me fer speaking to ye through an illusion.~ [NWBARA55]
@1 = ~Ye're good, I'll grant ye that. As a matter o' fact, ye're good enough that I'd be willing t' offer ye a sweet l'il reward should ye care to take care of Kurth for me... that *other* High Captain.~
@2 = ~What kind of reward?~
@3 = ~Kurth is already dead, actually.~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions, first.~
@5 = ~Hah! I've no interest in working for you.~
@6 = ~Ah-ha! So ye are interested, after all. That be good t' know. Well, now... what would make fer a fair offer? 1000 gold pieces an' some items of magical power, t' boot? I'd be more than willing to give you that if ye could actually rid me of that pest, Kurth, an' bring me his head. What do ye say to that?~ 
@7 = ~I want to get into the Host Tower, as well.~
@8 = ~What about Londa's children? Do you have them?~
@9 = ~Kurth made me the same offer, actually.~
@10 = ~Perhaps. I want more gold, however.~
@11 = ~I'm interested.~
@12 = ~What?! By Mask's damnable arse, that musclebound pig has to die! Bah! So why did ye speak t' me? What do ye plan t' do?~
@13 = ~I was hoping you could make me a better offer.~
@14 = ~The very possibility fills me with glee, I must admit. Ye'll have t' pardon me if I'm a wee bit skeptical on that, though. News o' Kurth's death has preceded him more 'n once. Now... if ye had his actual head. That'd be proof I could accept. There be only one mug like his, after all.~ 
@15 = ~Yes, I have his head here.~
@16 = ~Uhhh... no, me not haves head.~
@17 = ~I dinna like questions. Especially when they comes from people who dinna work fer me. I made ye an offer... do ye want it or nay?~
@18 = ~Ach, 'tis a shame. Ye come back an' speak t' me if ye change yer mind, aye? And before ye get it in yer head to come any further into me base, I'd advise ye not to. If ye comes through this door, I'll be thinkin' yer out to no good... an' treat ye as such.~ 
@19 = ~One could ask why someone like ye'd be interested in goin' into that bloody place. Would them wizards want to know, ye think? Heh heh... no worries, <GIRLBOY>, I've no reason to speak to 'em. Just in case they don't like whatever yer interest is, however, I don't think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don't ye take Kurth's, then, instead? He has one... an' without his head, he'll not need it.~ 
@20 = ~Eh? Who are ye... ahhhh, the brats from the Whitesnow manor, aye? Yes... I has them. Why do ye ask?~
@21 = ~I want them released.~
@22 = ~I just wanted to know that, that's all.~
@23 = ~Aye, I figured you'd be askin'. All right, then, <GIRLBOY>... 1250 gold pieces fer Kurth's head. How about that?~
@24 = ~No, thanks.~
@25 = ~Aye, now, that sounds just grand, it does! I'll be looking forward t' spitting on that thug's head, I will. Now... do ye wish to run off an' do the deed now, or do ye have somethin' else fer me?~ 
@26 = ~I have some questions.~
@27 = ~I've changed my mind.~
@28 = ~I'll go now.~
@29 = ~Ooooh, this be good! All right, <GIRLBOY>, ye've got me interest piqued. What is the pig paying ye?~
@30 = ~1000 gold pieces.~
@31 = ~1500 gold pieces.~
@32 = ~2000 gold pieces.~
@33 = ~You forgets it. Me not interested.~
@34 = ~Bah! I'm not about t' start playin' *that* game! Run along, <GIRLBOY>, if ye has a brain in yer head. Come through this door an' into me base an' ye'll be sorry... that much ye can be sure of.~ 
@35 = ~O-ho! Let me see! Ha ha ha! Aye, that be his ugly mug, without a doubt! So much fer yer stinkin' boasts, ye big oaf! Who be the last man standin' now, eh? Ha ha ha! Ye've done good, <GIRLBOY>, better 'an I'd hoped. Here... take yer gold an' yer items. Now I've much t' be done, so be on yer way.~ 
@36 = ~What about Londa's children?~
@37 = ~I want Londa's children released, as well.~
@38 = ~That's it? We're done?~
@39 = ~Good. Time to kill you, now.~ 
@40 = ~Pfft. Well, why not? Ye think I were just going t' take yer word for it an' shower ye with gold?~
@41 = ~Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I'll release 'em to ye once ye bring me Kurth's head. If ye're interested in me offer, that is...~
@42 = ~Why would ye even care? Bah. What about me original offer, then... Kurth's head in exchange for yer reward, aye?~
@43 = ~More gold? Can you even perform the task, you think? Kurth is no easy target, after all. No, I think the 1000 gold pieces shall be fine. Are you interested or no?~ 
@44 = ~One could ask why someone like ye'd be interested in goin' into that bloody place. Would them wizards want to know, ye think? Heh heh... no worries, <GIRLBOY>, I've no reason to speak to 'em. Just in case they don't like whatever yer interest is, however, I don't think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don't ye take Kurth's, then, instead? He has one... an' without his head, he'll not need it.~ 
@45 = ~Ach, 'tis a shame. Ye come back an' speak t' me if ye change yer mind, aye? And before ye get it in yer head to come any further into me base, I'd advise ye not to. If ye comes through this door, I'll be thinkin' yer out to no good... an' treat ye as such.~ 
@46 = ~Now why would you want to get into there? I suppose it's no concern of mine... if you wish to kill yourself, it's your business. Just in case they don't like whatever yer interest is, however, I don't think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don't ye take Kurth's, then, instead? He has one... an' without his head, he'll not need it.~ 
@47 = ~Aye? Well... I be not so fond o' questions, but ye can ask.~
@48 = ~What do you hope to get out of all this?~
@49 = ~Do you know what's going on in the Host Tower?~
@50 = ~Where do I find Kurth?~
@51 = ~What do you know about Kurth's defenses?~
@52 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@53 = ~I just wanted to know, that's all.~
@54 = ~Oh! You always want to play tricky, don't you? Don't think I didn't notice. Do as ye like, then. Know this, however: ye take one step past this door an' ye'll be dead before ye know it.~
@55 = ~Aye! Ha ha! Bring me that pig's head! I canna wait t' laugh at it good an' hard, ha ha! Just so yer awares, I'm not breathin' a word of our little deal here, aye? I don't want Kurth to hear none of it. So my men up top won't know yer workin' for me... not that they seem to have stopped ye much 'fore now. But let me tell ye this: if ye tries t' come into me base any further, I'll consider it a double-cross an' treat ye as such, aye? I'll be watching ye...~

@57 = ~Heh heh... that be it, aye? I can do far better for ye. 1500 gold pieces... plus a few magic items thrown in. If ye bring me Kurth's head on a platter. How does 'at strike ye?~
@58 = ~Aye? Heh heh... he be more desperate then I thought. All right, then, <GIRLBOY>... 2000 gold pieces an' some magic items thrown in, all fer Kurth's head. How does 'at strike ye?~
@59 = ~Heh heh... ye take me fer a fool, do ye? I'll give ye yer 1500 gold pieces, sure enough, an' some magic items thrown in... if ye gets me Kurth's head. How does 'at strike ye?~
@60 = ~O-ho, just toyin' with me, were ye? Ye think ye're so smart? Run along, <GIRLBOY>, if ye has a brain in yer head. Come through this door an' into me base an' ye'll be sorry... that much ye can be sure of.~ 
@61 = ~Oh, ye were actually serious about that, were ye? Ye want t' know what I did with the l'il brats, then? I turned the bigger ones into wererats... just like me. An' the smaller ones? We ate them! Ha ha ha! What feisty little morsels 'ey made! Either way, they all be dead now, ha ha ha! Ye can tell their mother that, aye! Now, then, we got no more business t' do. Be off with ye.~ 
@62 = ~Fine. But this isn't over.~
@63 = ~I killed one High Captain, Baram... I can just as easily kill another.~ 
@64 = ~That's horrible! You'll never get away with this!~
@65 = ~Heh... that weren't part of our agreement! An' even if it were, it be kind o' hard fer me to accomodate ye, heh heh. I turned the bigger ones into wererats... just like me. An' the smaller ones? We ate them! Ha ha ha! What feisty little morsels 'ey made! Either way, they all be dead now, ha ha ha! Ye can tell their mother that, aye! Now, then, we got no more business t' do. Be off with ye.~ 
@66 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@67 = ~Ye think so, do ye? I've outlasted all o' the other High Captains... what makes ye think I be frightened o' you? Be smart an' run along, now.~
@68 = ~The deal were ye brings back th' bloody head to me... so run back t' wherever ye left him and give it a good cut already, aye?~
@69 = ~So *if* Kurth be dead, I be sure ye're not mindin' running back an' collecting his head for me, aye? I can make it worth yer while, after all. Let me offer ye a reward fer it, just in case the o'er-muscled pig actually be dead.~ 
@70 = ~No thanks.~
@71 = ~Aye! Ha ha! Bring me that pig's head! I canna wait t' laugh at it good an' hard, ha ha! Just so yer awares, I'm not breathin' a word of our little deal here, aye? I don't want Kurth to hear none of it. So my men up top won't know yer workin' for me... not that they seem to have stopped ye much 'fore now. But let me tell ye this: if ye tries t' come into me base any further, I'll consider it a double-cross an' treat ye as such, aye? I'll be watching ye...~ 
@72 = ~Why do ye need t' know? Hah! It be no small matter, ye know. I infected myself with lycanthropy so I could get this far, so I could get the prize we've all been seeking! The High Captain that lives t' the last will be the one that becomes Luskan's war leader! An' that's t' be me... no doubts about it.~ 
@73 = ~Why would Luskan need a war leader?~
@74 = ~Aye, a bit. Them bloody wizards have been killin' each other, just like we have in the city. I think they be finally done... not sure, o' course, as it could always start up again. They got themselves a new Archmage Arcane, fer the moment. Maugrim be his name. Bloody cheerless fellow, if ye ask me. All 'e thinks about is Neverwinter an' how he wants t' destroy it. Don't know why.~
@75 = ~Well, the bloody pig has gone an' walled himself up in the West Harbor with all 'is men... everyone knows that. Coward, he is. There be an entrance, however, in the wall right next to 'is old tower. That's where his men come an' go from, anyhow. A dangerous path, though, an' well-guarded.~ 
@76 = ~Pfeh. Kurth be all about brawn, mostly. His Bloody Hands be nothin' but brute fighters, an' that be all he believes in. I hear he's gone an' allied himself with them priestesses of Auril, the cruel ice goddess. Not like 'im at all... he must be getting desperate. Heh heh, all the better, methinks. I don't know where he puts 'is men, or how many he has. Ye'll have to discover that for yerself.~ 
@77 = ~Aye, suit yerself.~
@78 = ~I want Londa's children released.~ 
@79 = ~Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I'll release 'em to ye once ye bring me Kurth's head, no sooner.~
@80 = ~Why would ye even care? I certainly don't.~
@81 = ~It be over an' then some. Take one step into me base, an' ye'll be mighty sorry fer it, I assure ye. Now run along... I have plans t' make.~
@82 = ~Aye, ye think so? Kurth didn't know ye were comin'... I do. An' I ain't no musclebound oaf, neither. Now run along, if ye've a brain in that head o' yers.~
@83 = ~I've already gotten away with it. Where do ye think most o' my rats came from? I never had that many men, I assure ye. Now run along an' do whatever it is ye do when yer not killing big oafs... if ye be smart, that is.~ 
@84 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@85 = ~Well, the bloody pig has gone an' walled himself up in the West Harbor with all 'is men... everyone knows that. Coward, he is. There be an entrance, however, in the wall right next to 'is old tower. That's where his men come an' go from, anyhow. A dangerous path, though, an' well-guarded.~ 
@86 = ~Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I'll release 'em to ye once ye bring me Kurth's head, no sooner.~
@87 = ~Heh heh... that be for me t' know, an' for everyone else t' find out. When it's time.~
@88 = ~It be over an' then some. Take one step into me base, an' ye'll be mighty sorry fer it, I assure ye. Now run along... I have plans t' make.~ 
@89 = ~So ye've come back, have ye? Changed yer mind about me offer?~ [NWBARA54]
@90 = ~I have a feelin' that it be my lucky day. How about it? Have ye good news?~ [NWBARA53]
@91 = ~I do. Kurth is dead.~
@92 = ~Aye, I thought as much. Ye've been playing me all along, haven't ye? Don't think I haven't noticed. Do as ye like, then. Know this, however: ye take one step past this door an' ye'll be dead before ye know it.~ 
@93 = ~Aye! Ha ha! Bring me that pig's head! I canna wait t' laugh at it good an' hard, ha ha! But let me tell ye this: if ye tries t' come into me base any further, I'll consider it a double-cross an' treat ye as such, aye? I'll be watching ye...~ 
@94 = ~Kurth is dead.~ 
@95 = ~There be nothin' fer us t' discuss! Take one step into me base an' ye'll be more'n a little sorry, I assure ye.~ [NWBARA51]
