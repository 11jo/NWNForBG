@0 = ~Greetings. I hope your visit to our fair village finds you well. We rarely see anyone new.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~I've spoken to you before. Don't you remember?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~I don't know if my answers will please. Your manner is so much more modern than our little village.~
@5 = ~Tell me about Charwood.~
@6 = ~I'm hunting for a cult that promoted plague in Neverwinter.~
@7 = ~Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?~
@8 = ~NP: I... don't quite understand what you're talking about. I've been here for ages and no one has been here. It seems that time has stopped... Time... has stopped... Nothing changes... nothing ends...~ /*I'm... not sure what you mean. I've been here for ages and not seen a soul. It's like time just stands still...*/
@9 = ~P-pardon me, I don't seem to be all that alert today. I'm sorry. What story were you telling?~
@10 = ~Why don't you remember?~
@11 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time.~
@12 = ~There isn't much to say. We're a small village. We've a mayor and two Lords, the Jharegs... Very normal, all around.~
@13 = ~Tell me about the different people around here.~
@14 = ~Charwood seems pretty isolated. Who protects you?~
@15 = ~Do you have shops? Merchants?~
@16 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@17 = ~I haven't heard anything about that. Never been to Neverwinter. They still building that Hall of Justice? I imagine it will take awhile.~
@18 = ~The Hall of Justice is a very old building.~
@19 = ~Where are your guards? Perhaps they know?~
@20 = ~NP: I would like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you some questions.*/
@21 = ~NP: We don't listen to stories... We stay here and let everything else flow by. You're talking about change... change... You must... go tell stories to Mayor Mobley... as Quint should have... Otherwise you'll cause change...~ /*We don't listen to people's stories... We just stay here and let everyone else move on. You talk of change... change...*/
@22 = ~Where can I find the Mayor?~
@23 = ~Who is Quint?~
@24 = ~What does the guard protect you from?~
@25 = ~Now don't go telling stories... You should go talk to the Mayor about such things. Mayor Mobley. I'm sure he'll listen to your story.~
@26 = ~Who would you like to know about?~
@27 = ~NP: Do these Jaregs have a castle?~ /*Them Jar-Eggs, they have castle?*/
@28 = ~Who are the important people in town?~
@29 = ~NP: Oh, we're protected by two Jareg lords: Carlat and... I don't remember the name of the other. They protect us. We're well protected... Er... sorry... please, you should talk to the mayor. It's not my place to discuss it.~ /*Oh, we are protected by the two Lords Jhareg: Karlat and... and I've forgotten the other's name. They protects us. We are well protected...*/
@30 = ~Are you afraid of that other Jhareg?~
@31 = ~NP: No. We don't want to attract attention, you know... well... I mean, we don't need any suspicious people here... We keep everything the way it is... everything stays the same... We shouldn't let things change, you know... Perhaps you can be served at the market on the road to Neverwinter... there, you know, they recently built a new trading post... Port Llast... ?~ /*Perhaps you'd be better served by camping along the Neverwinter trade route... there's a new outpost... Port Llast... ?*/
@32 = ~New? Port Llast is well established.~
@33 = ~NP: No... no, I know for sure, they just started... Nevers Castle had to be rebuilt too, because of the orc wars and stuff... I think... Stopped... frozen... He did it . He brought it to this with his stories... even after... the end...~ /*No... no I was quite sure I heard they were just starting... Castle Never was being rebuilt, too, what with the orc wars and all... I think...*/
@34 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go off like that. I'm just confused. Anyway, I'm sure you'll find what you need in Port Llast.~
@35 = ~NP: We don't need guards... except for the one at the castle gate. The Jaregi brothers founded Charwood. They keep us safe and... throw parties for the kids... We're here for the Jareg Brothers. You shouldn't talk about their business. It can bring about change. This may lead to the end.~ /*We have no need of guards... save the one at the castle gate. The brothers Jhareg founded Charwood. They keep us safe and... hold parties for the children...*/
@36 = ~You should be talking to Mayor Mobley. I can't say any more. People talk too much, tell too many stories... Like that Quint.~
@37 = ~The hall's in the heart of the village... You can't miss it... We don't...~
@38 = ~NP: Quint! He's crazy! He reads to them! He stopped us all! Leave him and leave us! Leave us... we... I... I really don't know what came over me... I'm sorry. Please... I can't talk about this anymore... Anything else?~ /*I... I don't know quite what came over me... I'm sorry. Please... I can't say any more about this... Is there something else?*/
@39 = ~From... From ourselves... From you... From Judgment... I don't know. What were we talking about?~
@40 = ~Yes, that's where... that's where Quint gives his readings... It's at the far end of town, beyond the gate... beyond everything...~
@41 = ~You should go to Mayor Mobley. He'll tell the story... please let his story be enough... not like Quint's. He told too many...~
@42 = ~I want to ask something else about Charwood.~
@43 = ~Quint. Quint was his name. Always reading to the children! That leads to trouble. Please, I can't speak of this. Mayor Mobley will help you.~
@44 = ~NP: But it's not... no... you're wrong... you... Stopped... frozen... He did it. He brought it to this with his stories... even after... the end...~ /*Stopped... frozen... He did it. He brought it to an end with his stories... happily ever after... the end...*/
