@0 = ~What brings you here? The guards weren't supposed to let anyone else into the Peninsula District... say, you aren't a new recruit, are you?~ [SEDOS051]
@1 = ~Lady Aribeth has temporarily assigned me to militia service.~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Has she now? Well, that's the first bit of welcome news I've heard all day.~
@6 = ~Sedos Sebile, of the Neverwinter Militia. I'm in charge of the operation here... And you?~
@7 = ~I'm called <CHARNAME>.~
@8 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I'm an adventurer.~
@9 = ~NP: My name doesn't matter, I'm the <CLASS> of the <CHARNAME> command.~ /*My name isn't important.*/
@10 = ~I don't generally give out my name.~
@11 = ~Look, there's a crisis out there and I have little time for friendly banter. What I need are warm bodies to throw at a problem outside of regular militia duties.~
@12 = ~What kind of job?~
@13 = ~Sorry, not interested. I'll be going now.~
@14 = ~NP: Well, go on your way, then. Be careful out there.~ /*Yes, on your way, then.*/
@15 = ~Very well. <CHARNAME> it is. Truth be told, we've got our hands full here in the Peninsula and could use your help... it's a bit outside standard militia duties though.~
@16 = ~An adventurer, hmm? Very well, <CHARNAME>, I could use your help here in the Peninsula... it's a bit outside standard militia duties though.~
@17 = ~As you wish. All the same, we've got our hands full here in the Peninsula and could use your help... it's a bit outside standard militia duties though.~
@18 = ~NP: All the prisoners have taken to the streets, and we are exhausted to the point of trying to protect civilians... As if Howling Death wasn't enough. I need someone to get into the prison and find out what the devil is going on. Lady Aribeth has instructed me to give 1000 gold to any militiaman who brings me proof that the problem is solved. Consider it risk pay.~ /*Lady Aribeth's authorized a 300 gold piece bonus to any militia member who can bring me proof that the situation's been resolved. Consider it danger pay.*/
@19 = ~How do you intend to get me into the prison?~
@20 = ~If you can't do it, how would I?~
@21 = ~NP: They've turned the prison into a fortress, send out assault squads from there, and then retreat back inside. They won't be easy to deal with. I think they actually have keys to get back into the fortress after they finish looting. None of the ones we caught had them, though.~ /*I think they probably carry keys to get back into the fortress once they've finished looting or whatever. Nobody we've caught has had one, though.*/
@22 = ~NP: Look, if I had the manpower, we could sort this out, but we're trapped. The prisoners are very well organized, they run the prison like a fortress. If they have breakouts, they all retreat to the prison. I think they actually have keys to get back into the fortress after they finish looting. None of the ones we caught had them, though.~ /*Look, if I had the manpower I might be able to get it done, but we are tapped out. The prisoners are organized, running the prison like a fortress. Their raiding parties always retreat back inside*/
@23 = ~Since you can't bust down the front door, you'll have to find the person with that key. I'd start near the sewers in the southwest of the district. We've seen a number of groups around there.~
@24 = ~That doesn't seem like much pay for a lot of work.~
@25 = ~Perhaps you'd be willing to give an advance... ?~
@26 = ~NP: What dangers await me?~ /*How did they escape?*/
@27 = ~Okay, me do it.~
@28 = ~No, I'm not interested in this.~
@29 = ~Perhaps, but the prisoners will likely have stripped the place of any valuables, and you're welcome to keep anything you confiscate from them.~
@30 = ~Certainly not. If I gave an advance to every militia member, the city coffers would be empty and the prisoners would still be rioting.~
@31 = ~Besides the prisoners, you may need to watch out for the Head Gaoler, Alaefin. Recent reports suggest he's the one who set them loose in the first place...~
@32 = ~Alaefin? What can you tell me about him?~
@33 = ~Good luck then, and don't forget to report back to me if you manage to resolve whatever the trouble is down there.~

@35 = ~Well, I can lead the horse to water but I can't make <PRO_HIMHER> drink. If you'll excuse me, then, there's lots to do in these troubled times.~
@36 = ~NP: He was one of the best of the militia, and I never heard a bad word about him. Lord Nasher personally appointed him warden. There's something wrong here. I suppose Howling Death might change the way you look at things.....~ /*He used to be one of the militia's best and, until now, I'd never heard a bad word said of him. Lord Nasher himself appointed him to the prison's command.*/
@37 = ~You again, is it? Have you changed your mind about entering the prison for me?~ [SEDOS053]
@38 = ~What was it you needed doing again?~
@39 = ~Yes, I've changed my mind. I'll do it.~
@40 = ~No, I'm still not interested.~
@41 = ~Hello again. I hope your search for the cause of the riots goes well. We need all the help we can get here. Have you found anything in the prison?~ [SEDOS054]
@42 = ~I'm not interested anymore.~
@43 = ~How do I get into the prison, again?~
@44 = ~Tell me again what the reward will be.~
@45 = ~I'll get back to it. Farewell.~
@46 = ~As you wish, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, but I have my orders and shall remain here until the job is done.~
@47 = ~NP: The escaped prisoners keep sending out groups of raiders. One of them must have the key to get back. You need to find whoever has that key. That's all I know about it.~ /*The escaped prisoners keep sending raiding parties out of the prison. One of them must have a key to get back in.*/
@48 = ~Aribeth has authorized a 300 gold piece reward. If you wish more, we will discuss it when you produce results.~
@49 = ~Excellent. I shall await your return, then.~
@50 = ~NP: Hi. It's nice to see people alive. Not sure what happened in the prison, but whatever it was, it made a strong impression on all of us here. Escaped convicts don't seem to be so scary anymore. Of course, they are still very dangerous, but the riot seems to be over. I have no explanation for that.~ [SEDOS056] /*The escaped prisoners seem to be a little less vicious. Certainly they are still dangerous, but whatever was driving the riot seems to be gone. I have no explanation.*/
@51 = ~Head Gaoler Alaefin was controlled by something.~
@52 = ~Something was controlling Head Gaoler Alaefin. I've got a piece of it.~
@53 = ~NP: Yes, they say it was an intelligence eater from Waterdeep. They also say you returned his remains to Aribeth. Good work! Her word is proof enough that you did the job. I suppose 1,000 gold pieces is enough for such a dangerous task?~ /*Her word is good enough proof that you did the job. I assume that 300 gold danger pay is sufficient?*/
@54 = ~Yes, that will do nicely.~
@55 = ~Better offer some more money, woman. I'd hate for you to... come to harm.~
@56 = ~I need no reward. The Prison's troubles have been resolved and that is all that matters.~
@57 = ~NP: Is there any way you can confirm that you have eliminated this threat? I can't put that in the report until we're absolutely sure. Prove to me that you actually did end what you claim was controlling him. Then we'll consider your reward.~ /*Do you have evidence to support that you have ended the threat? I cannot report this until we know for sure.*/
@58 = ~NP: Let me see that. That's a brain-eater's brain, isn't it? So that's why Captain Eleiffin was acting so strange! Of course it is. A brain-eater is one of the Waterdeep creatures Lady Aribet needed to make a cure for pestilence! You'd better take this to her. I suppose there's enough proof that you've done the work required. I think 1,000 gold pieces will be ample compensation for the risk.~ /*That said, this is proof enough that you've done the job I required of you. I imagine 300 gold in danger pay will be sufficient.*/
@59 = ~NP: Then I thank you for all you have done to accomplish this assignment. I'll give you a good reference when I make my report. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a report to make for Lord Nasher. He's not well, but the news of our success should lift his spirits.~ /*Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare that report to present to Lord Nasher. He is not well, but news of your success should lift his spirits some.*/

@61 = ~NP: You had a job to do, and you did it. Here's your payment, 1,000 gold pieces. I'll note in my report that you tried to threaten me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a report to make to Lord Nasher. He's not well, but the news of our success should lift his spirits.~ /*Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare that report to present to Lord Nasher. He is not well, but news of your success should lift his spirits some.*/
@62 = ~NP: Well done <SIRMAAM>. You did a great job and turned down the award. I will commend you very highly in my report. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a report to make for Lord Nasher. He's not feeling well, but the news of our success should lift his spirits.~ /*Now, if you'll excuse me, I must prepare that report to present to Lord Nasher. He is not well, but news of your success should lift his spirits some.*/
@63 = ~I really must file my report with Lord Nasher. Excuse me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~ [SEDOS055]
