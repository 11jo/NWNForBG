@0 = ~Please, you must help me!~ [NWWYVE61]
@1 = ~I have already lost a fellow ranger to the animals in this place. He lies just down not far from here, come with me, I'll show you.~ [NWWYVE65]
@2 = ~You have made short work of my creatures. 'Twould not be wise to let you do the same to me.~ [NWWYVE64]
@3 = ~Who are you?~
@4 = ~No deals. I'm here for your death.~
@5 = ~Wyvern, formerly a 'guest' of the Bulwark Prison in Waterdeep, at your service.~
@6 = ~Why did you ambush me?~
@7 = ~I intend to claim the bounty on you.~
@8 = ~Actually, I don't care to know who you are. Let us fight!~
@9 = ~If it must be this way, I shall not fall easily! Die!~
@10 = ~It was nothing personal. I thought that you might be a bounty hunter looking to kill me or take me back to that hellish dungeon. I would sooner kill myself then go back to that horrible prison! For ten years I felt not the sun on my face nor heard the call of wild. I am a ranger and for me, it was truly hell.~ 
@11 = ~Now I am free and back where I belong. I want nothing more than to be left alone and never again shall the rank stench of so-called civilization assail my senses.~
@12 = ~Why were you originally imprisoned?~
@13 = ~Why should I listen to anything that you say?~
@14 = ~I want your ear, Wyvern.~
@15 = ~Enough talk, Wyvern. It's time for you to die.~
@16 = ~I do not wish to die. The bounty requires only that you bring back my ear. I can also assist you in finding one of the other escapees.~
@17 = ~What do you propose?~
@18 = ~You want make deal?~
@19 = ~I was born in a forest to the east. My father was a ranger of some renown and he taught me to love the forest and all of the creatures within it. Life was idyllic, though it did not last. Men came to the forest. Human mercenaries on leave from their employ with the lord of the human lands west of the forest. They burned part of the forest, slaughtered the animals for sport, and crucified my father on a tree when he came to speak with them.~ 
@20 = ~Go on.~
@21 = ~There is a bounty on myself and the four who escaped with me. Hear me out and perhaps you may profit from it.~
@22 = ~I'll give you my ear if you'll allow me to leave. Tell them I'm dead, and let me become a recluse. I'll go into the wild and never return.~
@23 = ~So be it. I agree.~
@24 = ~Agreed, but only if you help me find the other escapees.~
@25 = ~No deal, you disgusting murderer! I'll kill you now!~
@26 = ~When my father did not return, my mother went to search for him. I found her dead at the foot of the tree where my father hung. She had been... brutalized before they killed her. My father still lived and had watched, helpless, as my mother was killed. He died in my arms and I swore vengeance.~ 
@27 = ~Then what happened?~
@28 = ~Here, this arrow tip be sharp enough... Szzhgah, that stings... There, a single ear. Don't spend it all in one place.~ [NWRAGE03]
@29 = ~Now, if you don't mind, I've got a poultice to prepare for where my ear used to be.~
@30 = ~As for my partners, I barely spoke to most of them. However, I do know that Zor is an idiot and has likely drowned himself in an ale barrel at the Green Griffon Inn. It was to be his first stop.~
@31 = ~I hunted them down. One by one I found them and killed them. I killed their families. I killed their dogs and their horses, stupid beasts that remained loyal to these men despite what they had done. When the human lord brought his forces against me, I disappeared into the woods and picked the men off with arrows until the survivors were so afraid of the forest, they called it haunted.~ 
@32 = ~You were captured?~
@33 = ~Your crimes sicken me! Die!~
@34 = ~I was betrayed by one of my own. A ranger who they hired from the west. He tracked me down and would not listen to reason. He talked of innocents killed and vengeance gone too far. He did not understand. I was captured and taken to the prison. There was no trial and only through the intervention of the ranger was I not killed outright. But that was many years ago and the rage has long since faded. My father was avenged and I only wish to travel the wilds and never see another settlement again.~ 
@35 = ~How did you escape?~
@36 = ~I escaped with the aid of other inmates Yesgar, Stirge, Zor, and Delilah. Typically, they were not the type I would associate with, but I was desperate to escape. I could not stand being in that cell, locked away from nature. I don't regret my actions and did not deserve to be caged.~ 
@37 = ~You don't wish to die and you want to make a deal?~
@38 = ~That's nice, but I'm here for the bounty.~
@39 = ~Indeed! This need not end in battle. Perhaps you'll allow me to make a suggestion? The bounty is for my ear.~
@40 = ~You have what you want, just leave me be.~ [NWWYVE60]
