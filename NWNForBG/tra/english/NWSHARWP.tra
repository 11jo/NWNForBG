@0 = ~NP: I... I don't think you're interested in doing good deeds at all, and I doubt I'd go with you again if you asked me to. Ð¯... I don't think we'll see each other again.~ [NWSHARB0] /*It just seems to me that Elves shouldn't put these things back in the ground if they didn't take them out in the first place.*/
@1 = ~You think so, do you? Hmph. I'll not help where I'm not wanted, if that's what you really want.~ [NWSHARB0]
@2 = ~Yes. Go.~
@3 = ~No. Stay.~
@4 = ~NP: Well, goodbye, then. Where can we meet if you change your mind?~ /*As you desire. I shall remain here, should you change your mind.*/
@5 = ~NP: Go back to the sword fair.~ /*Get to the point.*/
@6 = ~NP: I'll find you at Kendrak Barracks.~ /*Port Llast - Kendrack's Barracks*/
@7 = ~NP: Wait for me here.~ /*Wait right here.*/
@8 = ~Fair enough.~
@9 = ~I suspected you'd show up here soon. I'm glad to see I was right. So, then... shall we join up once more?~ [NWSHAR60]
@10 = ~Yep.~
@11 = ~No.~
@12 = ~Good. Let's go.~
@13 = ~If you change your mind you can find me here.~
@14 = ~So we meet again, <CHARNAME>. The others had told me Aribeth had recruited you to find the cultists... I can't say I'm surprised. You've acquired quite the reputation for yourself, haven't you?~ [NWSHAR53]
@15 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Sharwyn.~
@16 = ~You again? What, are you following me around?~
@17 = ~Goodbye.~
@18 = ~NP: And why is that? Just because we disagreed in Neverwinter, I have to disappear from the map of Fairun? In case you haven't noticed, we have a shortage of brave adventurers around here. Lady Aribeth approached me at the Sword Fair to hire me on Lord Nasher's behalf..... as well as you, I believe.~ /*And why is that? Just because we went our separate ways in Neverwinter, I'm supposed to disappear off the face of Faerun? If you haven't noticed, there's a shortage of good adventurers.*/
@19 = ~Like I have nothing better to do, I suppose? No, I've my own skills, thank you... and my own reasons for being here.~
@20 = ~If you need me, you know where I am.~
@21 = ~It looks to me like Lord Nasher is pulling out all the stops to find this cult. The search in Neverwinter is immense, and we mercenaries have been sent to Port Llast to join the effort with you and Aribeth. Lucky us.~
@22 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@23 = ~NP: How much would it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@24 = ~NP: Actually, I was paid a handsome sum for my services to Lord Nasher. It's another opportunity to gain fame, in my opinion. even though I was ordered to simply offer to help you and Aribeth. So, uh. you want my help?~ /*It's another chance at acquiring some fame, in my eyes... even though I've been told to merely offer assistance to you and Aribeth, for now. So... do you need my help?*/
@25 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@26 = ~I could use someone by my side.~
@27 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@28 = ~NP: A cult could be almost anywhere. Maybe you should look among the hills at the crossroads just as you exit town. I've heard more than once of monsters raiding the roads around here.~ /*The cult could be practically anywhere. You may want to look in the hills by the Green Griffon Inn... I've heard many tales of monsters raiding the roads nearby in force.*/
@29 = ~Monsters?~
@30 = ~It's about time you asked. I'm at your disposal, <CHARNAME>.~
@31 = ~NP: Mostly bugbears and orcs. However, they are said to be ruled by humans, which is very strange. In any case, ever since Luskan went head over heels, the surrounding provinces have been the target of constant raids... but these monsters are more organized than usual.~ /*At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.*/
@32 = ~NP: Hello again, <CHARNAME>. I believe you remember me? It was rather boring standing around waiting for Aribeth to take over.... Better yet, I'd better seek out this cult myself while earning my fame.~ [NWSHAR55] /*It's been rather boring standing around waiting for Aribeth to get her act together... I'd rather be out looking for this cult, making a name for myself while I'm at it.*/
@33 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@34 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@35 = ~If you're so interested in fame, why are you standing around here?~
@36 = ~NP: Of course. Lord Nasher spent an entire army to find the cult. Searching Neverwinter is a huge operation. I and the rest of the mercenaries have been sent to these parts to search, which is fine with me. A small team has a better chance of glory.~ /*I and these other mercenaries have been sent out to these parts to search, which is fine by me. More chances for fame in a smaller group.*/
@37 = ~NP: Well, maybe I just like boredom... or maybe I've been ordered to help you and Aribeth, and there have been no other instructions yet.... How's that? Will you do the sensible thing and take me with you, <CHARNAME>? It's a lot more interesting than just hanging around here.~ /*Well, it could be that I enjoy being bored... or it could be that my instructions are to aid you and Aribeth, and I haven't been told to do anything, yet.*/
@38 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra hand. You're in.~
@39 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@40 = ~NP: That's fine. Then I am at your disposal. I will follow you as long as you need me, <CHARNAME>.~ /*"My magic is at your disposal. What spell would you like me to cast?"*/
