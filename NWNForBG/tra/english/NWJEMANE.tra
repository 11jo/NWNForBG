@0 = ~What do you want? There's squat I can do to stop you looting, if that's what you're here for.~
@1 = ~I've been fighting undead. You need some help?~
@2 = ~Maybe I am, but I've undead to kill first.~
@3 = ~Just thank your lucky stars I'm not a flesh-eating corpse.~
@4 = ~I could use some. I'm probably going to be dead in an hour. I... might know something about these undead...~
@5 = ~Why do you think that?~
@6 = ~I don't have time right now.~
@7 = ~Yeah? I could use your help if you are looking to kill things. I think I know something about these undead...~
@8 = ~I suppose you could be worse. I'm going after worse right now. I think I know something about these undead...~
@9 = ~My brother has been acting... funny. He goes to a strange house just north of here. The undead leave it alone! He's not himself... I think they took his mind. There's a group in there... a cult... and my brother mentioned some kind of... creature. I don't know anything more about it than that. It's all happened so fast... right about when the zombies started showing up.~ /*He's not himself... I think they took his mind. There's a group in there... a cult... and my brother mentioned some kind of... creature.*/
@10 = ~I have questions about this strange house.~
@11 = ~I want to know some things about your brother.~
@12 = ~NP: I'll see what's going on in there. What are you gonna do?~ /*I might check it out. What are you going to do?*/
@13 = ~All right... just leave me, then. I guess I'll stay here. Not much I can do on my own.~
@14 = ~I'll tell you what I can.~
@15 = ~Any idea who lives at this house you mention?~
@16 = ~You say the undead leave the house alone?~
@17 = ~I suppose. What do you want to know?~
@18 = ~What's his name? What does he do?~
@19 = ~I found this ring in the cult hideout. Was it his?~
@20 = ~NP: Ð¯... I don't know. I wish I could help you find him, but I don't know if I can. I feel so helpless. He needs my help. I know he does.~ /*I... I don't know. I'd like to help find him, but I don't know if I could make it.*/
@21 = ~No clue, but I know they don't get attacked by the zombies, and I know my brother is acting weirder and weirder. They don't want any visitors, either. He uses some sort of key to get in, but it's not a normal one. Some kind of magic thing.~ /*They don't want any visitors, either. He uses some sort of key to get in, but it's not a normal one. Some kind of magic thing.*/
@22 = ~Could I have it?~
@23 = ~It's the strangest thing: They walk right around it, and don't attack the people going in. My brother said the creature keeps them safe? I honestly don't know what he's talking about anymore, and now he's been gone for days.~ /*It's the strangest thing: They walk right around it, and don't attack the people going in. My brother said the creature keeps them safe?*/
@24 = ~His name is Torin. He studied at a mage tower outside Waterdeep for a while, but never stuck with it. He's been a little lost. I think he wanted something that had quicker rewards. He didn't have much patience for books.~ /*His name is Torin. He studied at a mage tower outside Waterdeep for a while, but never stuck with it. He's been a little lost.*/
@25 = ~That's... that was my brother's. He always had it with him... he's dead. I know it. Thanks. I don't have much to give you... Just keep the ring. It reminds me of how he died, not his life.~ /*I don't have much to give you... Just keep the ring. It reminds me of how he died, not his life.*/

@27 = ~I have this thing that he used to get in the hideout... well, I'm sure it's not important. What do I know? The cult hideout is north of here. If you are going to look for him, that's where I'd start.~ /*I have this thing that he used to get in the hideout... well, I'm sure it's not important. What do I know?*/

@29 = ~NP: The cult's lair is just east of here, next door. If you want to find it, I suggest you start your search from there.~ /*The cult hideout is north of here. If you are going to look for him, that's where I'd start.*/
@30 = ~NP: I guess. I hope that means you'll try to find him. I'm worried. The cult's lair is just east of here, next door. If you want to find him, I suggest you start your search there.~ /*The cult hideout is north of here. If you are going to look for him, that's where I'd start.*/
@31 = ~Hello there... I gave that magic key-thing to you, didn't I? Oh, I'm just so worried about my brother that I don't know which way is up. Please, investigate that cult estate north of here. Please find my brother. I wish I could help... I'm not much use when things get dangerous. I know they are up to something in there, though.~ /*Please, investigate that cult estate north of here.
