@0 = ~Oh please! Can you help me? You're with the city militia, aren't you? The guards at the gates said I might get help over here, but I don't know if they were serious or not.~
@1 = ~Slow down. I'll hear what you have to say.~
@2 = ~What is it, woman? Why are you bothering me?~
@3 = ~MT: Thank you... I don't want to distract you from your duties at all... I mean, you're from the guards, right? You must have a lot to do... but this is so important. Peninsula. I live there and... oh, it's so terrible. These murders... everyone is trying to save their lives... it's so terrible...~ /*Thank you... I don't mean to take you away from your duties... I mean, you're a guard, right? Probably got your hands full... but this is important.*/
@4 = ~Easy, then. Tell me when you are ready.~
@5 = ~MT: Speak soon. I have many things to do.~ /*Enough with the flattery. I've got work to do.*/
@6 = ~I'm sorry, but I don't have time right now.~
@7 = ~This does not concern me. Get lost.~
@8 = ~MT: I... I'm sorry, but this is so terrible, I... I thought I'd find someone to help me... please... please listen to me. Peninsula. I live there and... oh, it's so terrible. These murders... everyone is trying to save their lives... it's so terrible...~ /*I'm... I'm sorry, but it's just so horrible I... I thought I could find someone to help over here but... please... please listen to me.*/
@9 = ~Okay... okay. I came from the Peninsula district. That's where my home is... was. Now it's too dangerous to go there. The prisoners are killing everyone. It's awful.~
@10 = ~I may have heard of this. Give some background on the Peninsula district.~
@11 = ~How did these prisoners get loose?~
@12 = ~Rounding up escapees, eh? Let's talk price.~
@13 = ~I... I guess I can wait, but there are so many people getting hurt and... the prisoners have escaped and... Please, the Peninsula district is in total chaos... please?~
@14 = ~But the Peninsula district is in total... I mean, the prisoners are killing everyone... Please? I've got nowhere else to... I guess I'll just wait here then.~
@15 = ~MT: Well, this is not easy. On the peninsula is Neverwinter Prison. Around it live families of guards and others... For many years it was a safe area... Some time ago, everything changed. One fine day, the guards didn't come home from work... and now there are fugitives everywhere. First the plague ... and now - just look, they will put a sharpener in your belly.~ /*It changed a little while ago. The guards never came home from work one day... and now, the prisoners are everywhere. First the plague... now the threat of a knife in your belly.*/
@16 = ~I'll see what I can do. You stay here where it's safe.~
@17 = ~MT: I don't know. I just do not know. Captain Eleifin always managed the prison so wisely, so carefully... I hope nothing happened to him. That is, I do not know him at all, but they say that he is a good person. He definitely wouldn't let that happen.~ /*I don't know. I just don't know. Captain Alaefin has always run such an efficient operation... I hope nothing has happened to him.*/
@18 = ~Isn't anyone in the district able to fight back?~
@19 = ~What? I... I don't have anything... I barely got out with my life. You work for the city, don't you? It's... It's your duty... isn't it?~
@20 = ~Of course, how callous of me to ask. I'm sorry.~
@21 = ~Oh, that just won't do. I guess I won't help, then.~
@22 = ~Wrong answer, wench! You'll pay me and you'll do it now!~
@23 = ~MT: Thank you. You have no idea how much this means to me. Can you tell me about the city? Rest assured, I can tell you everything. The peninsula is a part of the city, which is entered by a gate in the southwestern part of the center, near the &quot;Moonstone Mask&quot;. There are guards guarding the gate, but I assume they will let you through.~ /*The Peninsula district is through the gate on the southwest side of the City Core, near the Moonstone Mask. There are guards posted, but I'm sure they will let you through.*/
@24 = ~MT: The plague mowed down many guards. It was still safe there, as long as the prisoners were under lock and key. But then ... We were simply overwhelmed. Some are still trying to resist... There is Sedos Sebil. Lord Nasher has great confidence in her, but she lacks men. Now she basically only guards the gates of the quarter.~ /*The plague has cut down on the guards in the area. It was safe while people were locked up, but now, it's just overwhelming. Some are trying though...*/
@25 = ~MT: I think you have to look for a livelihood... hard times. I'm sorry, but I can't give you anything. I'm sorry. Maybe you can still help me?~ /*I guess you have to ask... times are hard. I'm sorry I can't give anything. I really am. Will you please still help?*/
@26 = ~MT: How is it not? What kind of guard are you? Please... no, I won't beg you. I will be here if you suddenly want to fulfill your direct duties ... I have nowhere else to go.~ /*What do you mean, you won't? What kind of a guard are you? Please... no, I won't beg. I'll be here if you choose to do the decent thing...*/
@27 = ~MT: Please don't touch me! Please! I... may have something... Please! Here! Take everything... that's all I have... hit you Ilmater... fuck you... fuck you... Leave me alone!~ /*Please don't hurt me! Please! I've got... maybe something... Please!! Here! take it all... it's all I've got... Ilmater damn you... damn you...*/
@28 = ~You just leave me alone! I've heard enough out of you! I'll get help from... someone... anyone but you...~
@29 = ~Have you heard anything? Has there been any word? Please tell me the Peninsula is safe again. I've been scared to ask. Everyone seems so busy. I just want to be able to go home.~
@30 = ~The Peninsula is returning to normal now. Everything is fine.~
@31 = ~I'll have to ask you to go back over some information.~
@32 = ~I have no news of that. Goodbye.~
@33 = ~Get lost, woman. I'm not your servant.~
@34 = ~MT: Oh... I just don't know how to thank you. You are so kind. I hope... I hope my neighbors survived too. Thank you. Thanks a lot. I have nothing to reward you with, but... Thank you again... so much. I... I don't even know your name.~ /*Thank you. Really. I have nothing more to offer, but I mean it. Thank you... so much. I... I don't know your name.*/
@35 = ~<CHARNAME>. Thank you for asking.~
@36 = ~MT: <CHARNAME>our squad leader.~ /*<CHARNAME> is too far away.*/
@37 = ~If it's all the same, I'll keep it to myself.~
@38 = ~I guess I'll... wait here then. Can't do anything else until the Peninsula district is safe again.~
@39 = ~MT: But... I was just... I was just hoping someone would help me... in some way... Okay... Okay! To ... perish and fail!~ /*But... I just... I just hoped I could get some help... anything... Well... Well fine! You just... You just go to hell! Pick one you like and you just go!*/
@40 = ~<CHARNAME>. Thank you for telling me. I'll make sure that only good things are said of you. I promise. Thank you again. Now I can go home.~
@41 = ~That is your right, though I only wished to sing your praises with it. Still, I am grateful, and will tell anyone exactly that. Thank you again. Now I think I'll go home... thanks to you.~
@42 = ~MT: I'm from the peninsula. There my house... was. Any news? Well, anything? Tell me the peninsula is all right again. I was afraid to ask. Everyone is so busy. I just want to go home.~ /*Have you heard anything? Has there been any word? Please tell me the Peninsula is safe again. I've been scared to ask. Everyone seems so busy. I just want to be able to go home.*/
