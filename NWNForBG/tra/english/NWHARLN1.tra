@0 = ~Aye, now... how about a lad like yourself takes a lass like me for an evening o' pleasure? Only a gold or two, no more.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~A gold or two? For you? You must be joking.~
@3 = ~You haves sores. You gots plague, no?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Oh, fine, fine. It's not like the gold is leaping into my lap today, after all.~
@6 = ~Why are you out here on the street? You're sick, you should be inside somewhere.~
@7 = ~How has the plague affected your trade?~
@8 = ~Could you tell me anything about the plague?~
@9 = ~Is there anything going on in this area of the city?~
@10 = ~I need some directions.~
@11 = ~Oh, aye, aye. I've got the plague or something just as good, an' you don't. You may wag your finger at me, <GIRLBOY>, but I ain't dead yet. So is there something you actually wanted, then, or are ye just going to stare?~ 
@12 = ~You have the plague?! Get away from me!!~
@13 = ~I... a workin' girl does not normally beg t' make her keep, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... but these ain't no normal times. Could you spare some kindness, mayhap?~
@14 = ~Waste coin on you? I think not.~
@15 = ~I could offer you mercy. A quick and painless death.~
@16 = ~I have nothing to give.~
@17 = ~Here... take a gold piece.~
@18 = ~Take this: 100 gp. Go and find someplace warm tonight, and rest.~
@19 = ~Ah, damn.~ 
@20 = ~Inside where? When you has the plague, nobody wants to take you in. You ain't got no family, even. And I ain't settin' foot in the Moonstone Mask, no way.~
@21 = ~Why wouldn't you go to the Moonstone Mask?~ 
@22 = ~Hah! You'd think it would be bad, that us girls would find nary a customer in all of Neverwinter who'd lie with us for a night, aye? Not at all, says I. The souls in this city, they all thinks they're going to die. Convinced of it, they are. So they pile together in the Moonstone Mask, lookin' for a last bit of joy. An' they look even for me. There's folks with the Wailing Death... they ain't deserved it none. They want a bit o' joy, just the same... and I won't be turning them away none.~ 
@23 = ~But you certainly don't need the coin if, ah...~ 
@24 = ~I can tells you plenty about the plague. From personal experience, in fact. Anything specific you wanted to know, aye?~
@25 = ~Do you know anything about what causes it?~
@26 = ~Have you heard anything about strange animals in the area?~
@27 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@28 = ~There's always things going on in the core. Most of it is out o' reach of my ears, however, except maybe the urgent whisperings of dyin' men.~
@29 = ~Maybe you've heard of something of interest?~
@30 = ~I'd be interested in work, if you know of anything.~
@31 = ~Go on, now, I don't have time to give directions when you could just find things yourself. Ask a guard, it'll keep them busy and away from me.~
@32 = ~Then begone, cruel <LADYLORD>. May the plague take ye, too.~
@33 = ~I... no. No, my <LADYLORD>. I thank you, but 'tis not my time just yet.~
@34 = ~Then leave me be and go on yer ways.~
@35 = ~Thank you, my <LADYLORD>, you are most gracious and kind. My babes will eat tonight, thanks to you.~
@36 = ~I... you are too kind, my <LADYLORD>! Bless you, bless your heart! My babes... my babes will live, once I'm gone. Bless you!!~
@37 = ~Naw. We working girls deal with sickness plenty enough, but this ain't got nothing to do with that. The sickness is in the air, an' there ain't no one who's immune. The girls at the Moonstone, they don't seem t' get the plague none. Could be the matron mother just hides it real well. More like, 'n fact.~ 
@38 = ~Anything else you can tell me?~
@39 = ~If I'm going to die, is that it? Yes, I'm going to die. But I got me babes, an' they ain't sick. They going to be orphans, soon. That'll be bad enough, for them. I'm going to give 'em what I can, before the Wailing Death takes me. Nothin' else I can do.~
@40 = ~Hmph. I don't like the matron mother none, that Ophala Cheldarstorn. Something not right with her, I says. That an' the Moonstone has too many rules. No, no, the only place for me is out on th' streets. That way, when I die, I ain't far from the pile over yonder.~
@41 = ~Strange animals? You mean beasts? No, I've heard nothin' about any beasts in these parts. If you're tellin' me that there's beasts roaming about the core... well, I don't want to hear none of it. There's enough death comin' for you in the nights as it is. Is there something else you wanted, then?~ 
@42 = ~Do you know anything about what causes it?~
@43 = ~What do you want to know?~
@44 = ~Depends. You could go to Castle Never, t'is interesting enough. Send them me love, if you would. Walk around, if ye wish. I'm sure you'll find all sorts to interest you, <GIRLBOY>.~ 
@45 = ~Nobody's spending coin, so nobody's hiring. Except maybe at the Moonstone... but even there probably not. Oh, I suppose there's work to be had. There's all kinds of things people need doin', especially with a city in chaos. Nothing that reaches my ears, however.~ 
@46 = ~Nope. Wait around some, you'll learn all you wants to an' more, I'm sure. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@47 = ~What do you need, girl? I have to work, yet, for a gold or so... lest I sleep in the street again an' catch the plague myself.~
@48 = ~Back again, my <LADYLORD>? You should really not be hangin' about me so much... I *am* ill with the Wailing Death, my <LADYLORD>.~
