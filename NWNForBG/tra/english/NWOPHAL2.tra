@0 = ~These are strange times, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The beds in the Moonstone Mask being filled by wounded soldiers. Who could have imagined?~ [NWOPHA54]
@1 = ~I have need of your services.~
@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~Didn't this place used to be a brothel?~
@4 = ~Bye bye.~
@5 = ~NP: Well, I'm afraid most of the usual services of the Mask of the Moonstone are no longer available to us. My staff is now being used to care for the wounded, and all the beds are occupied by either the dying or those who are already dead. The atmosphere is not conducive to romance. However, if you are interested in equipment for some covert operation, I can help.~ /*Well, I'm afraid most of the Moonstone Mask's services are unavailable. My staff are busy tending to the wounded and the beds are filled with the dead and dying.*/
@6 = ~Yes, let me see what you have in stock.~
@7 = ~No time for questions. We're swamped! I've never seen so many men and women flat on their backs. Well, not from injuries, anyway.~
@8 = ~NP: "The Mask of the Moonstone is known for the... private services... that we provide to visitors. But there are too many wounded right now. The temple is full, and we have more beds here than any other place in the city. Is it so strange that we are providing more needed services to the wounded of Neverwinter in this time of need?~ /*The Moonstone Mask was known for the... comforts... we gave our customers. But there are many wounded, the temple is full and we have more beds than anywhere else in town.*/
@9 = ~Off with you then. I'm too busy to say a long goodbye.~
@10 = ~I can use your gold to buy more bandages and clean sheets. The ones we have are a little bloodstained, you know.~
@11 = ~And Luce is no help. Used to be one of my best girls, but ever since she was reunited with her little sister she spends all her time doting on that girl.~
@12 = ~And Luce is no help. Used to be one of my best girls, but ever since her little sister disappeared she does nothing but mope in the corner.~
