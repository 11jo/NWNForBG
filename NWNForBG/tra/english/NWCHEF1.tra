@0 = ~Now don't go bothering me. I didn't want this job and I don't need this job. Just say the password and get moving, like all the rest. And don't ask me about any key or whatnot. If you know the password then you'll have your own damn key. I don't have one.~ /*Now don't go bothering me. I didn't want this job and I don't need this job. Just say the password and get moving, like all the rest.*/
@1 = ~Who are you? What do you do?~
@2 = ~You wish a password?~
@3 = ~Can I ask about the Tavern and what's below it?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Who, me? I'm the chef, and these Bloodsailors have me guarding the door because they've lost too many regular members to the plague. None of it matters to me. I'd rather be cooking. Now, if you have the password, you'd better spit it out.~ /*Who, me? I'm the chef, and these Bloodsailors have me guarding the door because they've lost too many regular members to the plague.*/
@6 = ~The password is "Cornerstone."~
@7 = ~If you don't care, how about just forgetting it?~
@8 = ~Well, handsome, maybe we can... work something out?~
@9 = ~Will some gold make you forget you need a password?~
@10 = ~You'll let me pass or I'll feed you your spine!~
@11 = ~I don't know the password.~
@12 = ~Yes, fool, a password. If that door gets opened before I've heard a password, I'm supposed to call the guards. Now, out with it.~
@13 = ~Look, I'm just the chef. I'm replacing a Bloodsailor that died of plague. If you have business downstairs, fine. Just give me the password and go.~
@14 = ~Don't bother me again. It's bad enough I have to stand around here all day.~
@15 = ~Right, good enough for me. In fact, that's good enough for the night. Anyone else with you, they can go on in as well. I'm done with caring about their stupid door. I did my part, and now I'm done.~ /*Right, good enough for me. In fact, that's good enough for the night. Anyone else with you, they can go on in as well.*/
@16 = ~You know, I think you are right. To hell with this password crap. I'm no guard! I'm no doorman! You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.~ /*You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.*/
@17 = ~No, I don't think that would be the best thing for me to do. I'm no guard, but these Bloodsailors are rough customers.~
@18 = ~Well now, I've never been able to say no to a pretty face. Ah, what the hell. I'm no guard. Why did they even ask me to do this? You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.~ /*Well now, I've never been able to say no to a pretty face. Ah, what the hell. I'm no guard. Why did they even ask me to do this?*/
@19 = ~I don't know about that. The fact that you need to ask means you shouldn't be here.~
@20 = ~How about 50 gold to look the other way?~
@21 = ~How about 100 gold to look the other way?~
@22 = ~200 gold should get you to forget me, hmm?~
@23 = ~I was only testing. I meant nothing by it.~
@24 = ~What? No thank you! I'm not fighting over this! Guards! Guards!~
@25 = ~Then get lost, and don't bother me again. If you don't know the password, then you aren't supposed to be here.~
@26 = ~They can watch their own bloody doors. Damn right.~
@27 = ~Of course, you'll still need to open the door. I don't know nothing about that. If you should be down there, you probably have your own key.~
@28 = ~I guess that would be all right. I kind of like you, and what am I doing guarding a door anyway? I'm a chef! You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.~ /*You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.*/
@29 = ~I think that would suffice. I mean, why are they asking me to guard the door anyway? I'm a chef. A chef! You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.~ /*I think that would suffice. I mean, why are they asking me to guard the door anyway? I'm a chef. A chef!*/
@30 = ~No, I don't think I want to risk my neck for that amount. I don't much like you. Can you do better?~
@31 = ~I think that would be a good deal. I mean, why are they asking me to guard the door, anyway? I'm a chef! You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.~ /*You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.*/
@32 = ~Does that mean you know the password or not?~
@33 = ~Right, so who opened that door? I can't let anyone through without the password, whether they have a key or not. Of course, it's not like I care that much. Why they got the chef to guard this stupid door, I'll never know.~ /*Of course, it's not like I care that much. Why they got the chef to guard this stupid door, I'll never know.*/
@34 = ~Don't bother me, all right? I did my part with the door and I don't care who goes through now.~
