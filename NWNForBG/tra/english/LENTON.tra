@0 = ~What do you want? Sorry, I'm in a foul temper today. How can I help you?~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~NP: My name is Lenton. So, back to the question - what do you need?~ /*Fine. So like I said, what do you want?*/
@5 = ~What's put you in this mood?~
@6 = ~You're certainly miserable.~
@7 = ~NP: You know, Ill probably try to answer. Just dont mess with me anymore.~ /*I guess I'll try. Don't waste my time though.*/
@8 = ~What's your name?~
@9 = ~What's going on here?~
@10 = ~Why are you in such a bad mood?~
@11 = ~Ya, bye.~
@12 = ~How about we start with creator-race-obsessed Jax and his stupid expedition to find ruins that don't exist.~
@13 = ~NP: Do you think ruins dont exist?~ /*You don't think the ruins exist?*/
@14 = ~You're miserable. I'm done talking to you.~
@15 = ~Maybe before you judge people, you ought to find out if they have a reason for being upset.~
@16 = ~Nothing! We're all just standing around doing nothing. I can't stand it anymore.~
@17 = ~What exactly can't you stand?~
@18 = ~NP: I used to think they were. Jax has really screwed my brains out. But we searched the place cave by cave. And you know what we found?~ /*Oh, I did. Jax had me totally convinced. But we searched through cavern after cavern. And you know what we found?*/
@19 = ~Nothing?~
@20 = ~I have no idea.~
@21 = ~Fine. That actually improves my day!~
@22 = ~Blast! I wish we had found nothing.~
@23 = ~NP: We found the trolls! And ogres! A horde of trolls in company with their pet ogres. No ancient creatures, no tombs, no books, just trolls and ogres. We studied there such, you see, an unusual arrangement of stones - Jax decided that they were laid out like that on purpose. It turned out not. Suddenly I hear someone yelling.~ /*We were studying this unusual rock formation, because Jax thought it might be special. But it wasn't. Suddenly I hear this scream.*/
@24 = ~I turned around and there's this huge troll holding my brother, Drokas, by one leg. It dangles him upside down and then... it bites his head off.~
@25 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. That's horrible.~
@26 = ~Guess you should have been paying better attention.~
@27 = ~NP: I dont care about your pity! I need help. The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and roaring, and the whole gang, or whatever you want to call a bunch of trolls, burst into the cave and attacked us. Only a few of us slipped out of those caves. I want someone to go back there and kill every last one of those trolls. Especially this big guy.~ /*The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you're supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us.*/
@28 = ~What would you be willing to pay to have these trolls and ogres wiped out?~
@29 = ~That sounds like an important job. I'll do it.~
@30 = ~I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@31 = ~NP: This is exactly what I need you to help me get my revenge. The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and roaring, and the whole gang, or whatever you want to call a bunch of trolls, burst into the cave and attacked us. Only a few of us slipped out of those caves. I want someone to go back there and kill every last one of those trolls. Especially this big guy.~ /*The one that... ate my brother was obviously the leader. He started pointing and snarling and a whole tribe, or whatever you're supposed to call a group of trolls, rushed out and started to attack us.*/
@32 = ~All I can afford to pay you is 300 gold. That's all I have left after this fool's errand. So what do you think?~
@33 = ~Excellent. Bring me the troll Chieftain's head and I will pay you 300 gold.~
@34 = ~NP: East Road: Troll head trophy Lenton, one of the archaeologists, was lucky to get out of the troll caves near the road east of Port Llast, but his brother was killed in the fight. Burning with a thirst for revenge, he asked us to bring him the head of the troll leader who killed his brother.~ /*Lenton, one of the archeologists lucky enough to escape from the troll caves along the road east of Port Llast, lost a brother in the attack. Eager for vengeance, he has asked adventurers to return to him with the head of the troll chieftain responsible.*/
@35 = ~Like I should be surprised. If you decide to develop a backbone, just come back here.~
@36 = ~I see you are back again. Have you changed your mind about killing those trolls?~
@37 = ~What do you want done again?~
@38 = ~I have the troll's head right here.~
@39 = ~NP: My mind has changed, I will kill these trolls.~ /*I've changed my mind, I'll hunt the trolls for you.*/
@40 = ~No. I'm still not interested.~
@41 = ~Oh for pity's sake. All right, do you need the whole story again, or just a summary?~
@42 = ~The whole thing.~
@43 = ~A summary.~
@44 = ~NP: Finally! My brother is avenged. I must admit your abilities are impressive. Give it here, Ill burn it with pleasure. I wish I could pay more but that 600 is all I have. Sorry its so small.~ /*I will take that off your hands and burn it with pleasure. I wish I had more gold to pay you, but 300 is all I have. Sorry there isn't more.*/
@45 = ~I need no reward. Avenging a life and slaying evil is reward enough.~
@46 = ~As we agreed, that will be fine.~
@47 = ~You had better find some more, or I'll make you look like this troll.~
@48 = ~Then why are you bothering me? Don't talk to me unless you want to hunt some trolls.~
@49 = ~NP: You need to go down into the caves and kill all the trolls. And then bring me the head of the healthiest. So, are you ready to get to work?~ /*I want you to go down into the caves and kill all of the trolls. Then bring me back the big guy's head.*/
@50 = ~Sure.~
@51 = ~No, I'm not interested.~
@52 = ~NP: You -<MALEFEMALE> great nobility. I will tell everyone I know about your exploits.~ /*You are an honorable <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I shall tell everyone I know of your heroic deeds.*/
@53 = ~NP: East Road: Troll head trophy Lenton, one of the archaeologists, was lucky to get out of the troll caves near the road east of Port Llast, but his brother was killed in the fight. Burning with a thirst for revenge, he asked us to bring him the head of the leader of the trolls who killed his brother. We complied with his request, and Lenton thanked us.~ /*Lenton, one of the archeologists lucky enough to escape from the troll caves along the road east of Port Llast, lost a brother in the attack. Eager for vengeance, he asked adventurers to return to him with the head of the troll chieftain responsible. They complied and Lenton has expressed his gratitude.*/
@54 = ~NP: Very good. Well, all the best to you in the future.~ /*Very well. Good luck to you in the future. I am off.*/
@55 = ~NP: Yes, such statements were to be expected from people like you. Threat all you want. Kill me, search your pockets - still no more coins. Heres 600 gold, just like I promised.~ /*I guess I should have expected such a comment from your type. You can threaten all you want. You won't find anymore money on my corpse.*/
@56 = ~So you're back. Do you have the head of the troll chieftain yet?~
@57 = ~NP: Once again, what should I do?~ /*What me do again?*/
@58 = ~NP: I have a troll head.~ /*I have Guzud's head.*/
@59 = ~I'm working on it.~
@60 = ~NP: Oh, my grief! You need to go to the caves and kill all the trolls. And bring the head of the biggest troll to me. Everyone, go and finish this job.~ /*Oh, for pity's sake! I want you to go down into the caves and kill the trolls. Bring back the big troll's head.*/
@61 = ~All right, well keep trying. I'll be waiting.~
@62 = ~NP: Thank you, now my brother is avenged.~ /*Thank you, Aarin. I shall keep it safe.*/
@63 = ~NP: What do you need? Our business is over, dont bother me anymore.~ /*Then be gone and bother me no more.*/
