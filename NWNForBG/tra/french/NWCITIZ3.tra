@0 = ~Who are you? Bandits? City Guard? Doesn't matter. Plague treats us the same. You don't want to stay here, friend.~
@1 = ~I am acting as a guard. I need information.~
@2 = ~I just need to ask a few questions.~
@3 = ~Don't tell me where to go. I do what I want.~
@4 = ~I'm going now.~
@5 = ~You've got questions? Well, so do I. What good are you, guard, when everyone around me is dying of plague? Answer me that. I lost my mother... she rotted away from the inside as I watched. The plague left her mindless at the end...~ 
@6 = ~I've got no time for questions. What point is there in my answers, I'll be dead in a week. Just like everyone else.~
@7 = ~Frankly, I don't care. Push your way through plague-infested homes if you want. I hope you rot like you deserve.~
@8 = ~That's for the best. I've got mourning to do, and I don't need more people dropping dead while I do it.~
@9 = ~So you see, I don't think I have much use for a guard. If you have questions, go ahead. I suppose you have reports to file, or something.~
@10 = ~I need infomation about the Docks district.~
@11 = ~How widespread is the plague here?~
@12 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@13 = ~Goodbye.~
@14 = ~What is it you want to know? Couldn't you just stumble around on your own?~
@15 = ~Any locations of interest in this district?~
@16 = ~Who are the important people in this district?~
@17 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@18 = ~How wide does it look? I've already said how it affected me and my home. What more do you want? Should we go count corpses?~
@19 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@20 = ~Maybe... look, I don't want to talk out of turn. I really shouldn't... and what does it matter... we're all going to die, anyway.~
@21 = ~Well, if plague is your interest, it's pretty much everywhere. Really, I'm not sure what you are looking for. A tavern? A shop?~
@22 = ~A tavern or inn.~
@23 = ~A place to get supplies.~
@24 = ~Important people? How would I know? I'm just some guy waiting to die. I'm a long way from whoever the Bloodsailors are calling boss this week.~
@25 = ~Who are the Bloodsailors?~
@26 = ~If you have questions, go ahead. I suppose you have reports to file, or something.~ 
@27 = ~I guess there was some commotion at the Seedy Tavern or something, but it's all quiet here now. Nothing going on except the plague slowly killing us all.~
@28 = ~I suppose I might as well say, though I don't know much. I hear there's some kind of infighting going on with the Bloodsailors. There have been notices of some sort of auction at the Seedy Tavern. Vengaul Bloodsail himself is putting on some sort of show, or something.~ 
@29 = ~Pirates not like attention like that.~
@30 = ~Vengaul is putting on a show?~
@31 = ~The Helmites claim their blessings are a cure. Bunch of crap. Everyone I know is dying, or will be.~
@32 = ~I guess there's Jim Seedy's place, the Seedy Tavern. It's in the north end of the district. Good luck getting past the bouncer. I don't know why they stay open with the threat of plague around but... well... I don't put much stock in rumors.~ 
@33 = ~Where can you get supplies?~ 
@34 = ~I suppose you would be looking for the Twenty in a Quiver in the center of the district. It's always well stocked.~
@35 = ~Is there a tavern or inn here?~ 
@36 = ~Who are the... ? Wow, you must be new. The Bloodsailors run the docks. Any ship that travels without their okay doesn't get far.~
@37 = ~So they are pirates?~
@38 = ~Who is their leader now?~
@39 = ~I know. There's talk of... well, you can guess what angering pirates will get you. I overheard a man named Callik in the Golden Apple tavern... well... I guess I don't need to say anything more about it. I may die of the plague, but I don't want my legs torn off before then.~ 
@40 = ~He likes to do things flashy. I think it's an auction or something. I guess it's caused a lot of fuss. Lots of people want gold for it. Someone said it had something to do with the plague, but everything seems like it has something to do with the plague. People are scared.~ 
@41 = ~I guess. They don't seem to make much of a secret about it. Their leader is pretty open about that stuff. If he's still leader.~
@42 = ~Their namesake, Vengaul Bloodsail. He's the reason they are allowed to operate. I think he used to know Lord Nasher, of all people! He keeps them from being just a band of cutthroats. I think he prefers to think himself a dashing rogue. Seems a little old for it.~ 
@43 = ~Where would this Vengaul hide?~
@44 = ~I wouldn't know. Maybe... no, I don't put much stock in rumors...~
@45 = ~Not sure why you are here. I said my piece. Now I'm just waiting for the plague to take what little I have left in this world.~
