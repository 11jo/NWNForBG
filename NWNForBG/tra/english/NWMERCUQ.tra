@0 = ~What can I do for you, citizen? One of the Mayor's Merry Men, at your service!~
@1 = ~Could you answer a few questions for me?~
@2 = ~Get out of my way, soldier boy.~ /*Out of my way, money-grubber.*/
@3 = ~All right, I'm gonna go now.~ /*"It's all right. I understand."*/
@4 = ~I suppose I could.~
@5 = ~You're a mercenary. That mean you're for hire?~
@6 = ~Say, where else have you served?~
@7 = ~I need some directions.~
@8 = ~I'm looking for some people.~
@9 = ~Watch your mouth, citizen.~
@10 = ~Stay out of trouble, citizen.~
@11 = ~Not me, I've had my fill of monsters. Mayor Kendrack pays my room and board and I guard Port Llast from drunken sailors and whatever monsters wander by. That's enough excitement for me. You can talk to the other mercenaries at the Town Hall. It's the building behind me.~ /**/
@12 = ~I was in Neverwinter for a while before the Wailing and even working a pirate gig in Luskan before they kicked all of us foreigners out.~
@13 = ~What can you tell me about Luskan?~
@14 = ~What are you looking for?~
@15 = ~I need a place to sleep and drink.~ /*Me want place */
@16 = ~What kind of stores do you have around here?~
@17 = ~Are there any other towns in the region?~
@18 = ~I need to ask you something else.~ /*Me need ask about sick.*/
@19 = ~Who are you looking for?~
@20 = ~Does Port Llast have a ranger or druid I could speak with?~
@21 = ~Know where I can find a priest?~
@22 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@23 = ~When I left, the High Captains were fighting tooth and nail against each other, vying for the Arcane Brotherhood's attention. I doubt it's any different now, either.~
@24 = ~Thank you. That's all I need to know.~
@25 = ~A few of us maintain quarters at the Alliance Arms - in the center of the town. The ale's not great but the sheets are clean.~
@26 = ~For regular items, try the Cracked Anvil, east of the barracks, along the road. It stocks all of the basic items you'll need. Haljal has some special stuff set aside too, I hear. There's also a visiting alchemist selling potions in a tent near the town hall.~ /**/
@27 = ~Well, there is Charwood to the south. Never been there myself, though. They're a quiet folk, from all acounts, and don't stray far from home.~
@28 = ~Go to the grove outside the city walls, northeast of the town, a fella named Ballard.~
@29 = ~The temple is in the center of town, right over there by the pier. Pretty hard to miss.~ /*Temple of Tyr in the northwest part of town, there. */
@30 = ~Mayor Kendrack of course, he's the one who hired me. You can always find the mayor at the town hall on the west side of town. Ugh... I don't have to explain, that's where you and I are standing.~
