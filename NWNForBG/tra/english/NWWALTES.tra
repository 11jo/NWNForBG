@0 = ~Don't worry about me! Just kill that fool Drawl! Get him!~ [NWWALT52]
@1 = ~He's gone... I know it... Drawl is finally gone. Good riddance. He brought all my old friends down with him... The Sword Coast Boys... all dead. Thanks for getting rid of Drawl. He's kept me here for days. Just to show me up, I guess. My name is Walters.~ [NWWALT55] /*He's gone... I know it... Drawl is finally gone. Good riddance. He brought all my old friends down with him... The Sword Coast Boys... all dead.*/
@2 = ~You're dressed like a city guard. Why were you captured?~
@3 = ~What was this Drawl creature?~
@4 = ~What's going on here?~
@5 = ~A gang couldn't have caused all this trouble.~
@6 = ~I AM a guard, but I used to run with the Sword Coast Boys. They never forgave me for "joining the enemy." Especially Drawl. I guess he wanted to make an example of me after he... changed. I got off lucky, I guess... not like some others...~ /*I AM a guard, but I used to run with the Sword Coast Boys. They never forgave me for "joining the enemy." Especially Drawl.*/
@7 = ~I have questions about Drawl.~
@8 = ~I have questions about you, Walters.~
@9 = ~I have questions about the "others" you mentioned.~
@10 = ~I should get moving. What will you do now?~
@11 = ~He used to be a friend of mine, back when I ran with the Sword Coast Boys. Never forgave me for "joining the enemy" as a guard. I guess he wanted to make an example of me after he... changed. I got off lucky, I guess... not like some others...~ /*He used to be a friend of mine, back when I ran with the Sword Coast Boys. Never forgave me for "joining the enemy" as a guard.*/
@12 = ~The Beggar's Nest is obviously under siege by undead. I don't know what's doing it, but it sure made a mess of the Sword Coast Boys. Drawl seemed to have made some sort of deal for the power he received. He corrupted the whole gang... some used to be my friends...~ /*The Beggar's Nest is obviously under siege by undead. I don't know what's doing it, but it sure made a mess of the Sword Coast Boys.*/
@13 = ~I have questions about the "others" you mentioned.~
@14 = ~I agree. If you were in on destroying Drawl, you know that he had far too much power for the smalltime hood that he was. Drawl seemed to have made some sort of deal for the power he received. He corrupted the whole gang... some used to be my friends...~ /*I agree. If you were in on destroying Drawl, you know that he had far too much power for the smalltime hood that he was.*/
@15 = ~I'll answer what I can, but we should keep it short. There are still zombies swarming the district. Killing Drawl didn't get rid of them.~
@16 = ~Should killing Drawl have stopped the zombies?~
@17 = ~I assume he wasn't always like this?~
@18 = ~I need to ask something else.~
@19 = ~About me? All right, but we should keep this short. There are still undead swarming all over the Beggar's Nest, and killing Drawl probably didn't get rid of them.~
@20 = ~Why did you quit the gang and become a guard?~
@21 = ~Where you supposed to patrol?~
@22 = ~Back to my general questions...~
@23 = ~Ever since I left, Drawl really tightened his grip on the Sword Coast Boys. He didn't want anyone else leaving... not alive, anyway. A few weeks ago, I guess some of the guys tried to convince Drawl to take the gang out of the city. They wanted to try and avoid the plague.~ /*Ever since I left, Drawl really tightened his grip on the Sword Coast Boys. He didn't want anyone else leaving... not alive, anyway.*/
@24 = ~What happened to them?~
@25 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@26 = ~I'd like to get out of here, of course. I don't know if I could make it to the main gates on my own unless the zombies were taken care of.~
@27 = ~I think you should go to the gate.~
@28 = ~Just wait here until I clear things out.~
@29 = ~I doubt it. Drawl couldn't have been behind it all. He was an idiot. A tough one, but still an idiot. He was pure patsy. Stopping the zombies probably means finding this "Gulnan" creature Drawl was bragging about. Don't know anything about how to do that, though.~ /*Stopping the zombies probably means finding this "Gulnan" creature Drawl was bragging about. Don't know anything about how to do that, though.*/
@30 = ~Who helped this Drawl?~
@31 = ~Why would someone corrupt a gang like that?~
@32 = ~Well, Drawl was always a jerk. He had big plans for the Sword Coast Boys becoming a mercenary company, but he was lazy. It was all talk. The only thing that changed was that he became a *powerful* jerk. He thought he was a lich or something. He was too stupid to see he was just a pawn.~ /*The only thing that changed was that he became a *powerful* jerk. He thought he was a lich or something. He was too stupid to see he was just a pawn.*/
@33 = ~If he's just some kid, who gave him this power?~
@34 = ~I'll answer what I can. Anything to help people not end up like the others in the gang did.~
@35 = ~Because it's a job with a future. Drawl promised a lot, but he never delivered. His plans never accomplished anything but petty crime. Since I joined the guards I'd been trying to straighten him out, but he wouldn't listen. Always looking for the easy way, no matter the long term cost.~ /*Because it's a job with a future. Drawl promised a lot, but he never delivered. His plans never accomplished anything but petty crime.*/
@36 = ~I was patrolling near the gate to the city core. They must have noticed I'm missing, but probably can't spare anyone to look. I'll have to find my way back there eventually. Dangerous with the undead, though.~ /*I was patrolling near the gate to the city core. They must have noticed I'm missing, but probably can't spare anyone to look.*/
@37 = ~I'll be here at the gate for now. I'm still a bit weak after being trapped in the warehouse.~
@38 = ~The same thing that happened to all of the boys. Drawl made some deal to become... whatever it was he became, and the rest of them were killed. All the old gang... gone. I'm just glad Drawl got what he deserved in the end. Good riddance.~ /*The same thing that happened to all of the boys. Drawl made some deal to become... whatever it was he became, and the rest of them were killed.*/
@39 = ~I suppose, but there are still a lot of undead swarming around. Drawl's benefactor is out there somewhere. I wish I wasn't so weak right now.~
@40 = ~I don't know. He bragged about someone named Gulnan... said he was her "Lieutenant of Evil." I bet he gave himself the title. Adolescent garbage. Whoever or whatever Gulnan is, the two of them must have had a way to meet. Have you thoroughly checked the warehouse? Some strange things went on.~ /*Whoever or whatever Gulnan is, the two of them must have had a way to meet. Have you thoroughly checked the warehouse? Some strange things went on.*/
@41 = ~Well, if they got some willing people, maybe they'd make better henchmen than mindless zombies. I don't know anything about undead. It could be that they just wanted to cause chaos... or make people afraid that even people without the plague could turn on them...~ /*Well, if they got some willing people, maybe they'd make better henchmen than mindless zombies. I don't know anything about undead.*/
@42 = ~He was bragging nonstop about someone. I think the name was Gulnan. I don't know what or who that is. Drawl wouldn't say. Personally, I don't think he really knew. He was just happy to be tough enough to back up his threats for once. I do know that he'd been in contact with this Gulnan a lot, so there's got to be a link between them around here somewhere.~ /*Personally, I don't think he really knew. He was just happy to be tough enough to back up his threats for once.*/
@43 = ~The dragon is dead. Dungeon I'd like to get out of here, of course. I don't know if I could make it to the main gates on my own unless the zombies were taken care of.~ [NWWALT55] /*I'd like to get out of here, of course. I don't know if I could make it to the main gates on my own unless the zombies were taken care of.*/
@44 = ~Hello to you. I hope the day finds you well. Looks like things are finally settling down in the Beggar's Nest.~ [NWWALT55]
@45 = ~Things are pretty quiet here at the gate now that the threat in this area is gone. Saves the guards a lot of worry.~
