@0 = ~I see by looking at you that you are not from my world of Azallah, but I thank you for your aid nonetheless.~ [ASHIR602]
@1 = ~Had you not intervened I fear I would have succumbed to the scaled raiders. My name is Asheera of the Shining Order, from the city of Sahaladar.~ [ASHIR603]
@2 = ~Except for your clothes, you look like Aribeth de Tylmarande!~
@3 = ~My garments are those of my people, though perhaps they look as strange to you as your own garb does to me.~ [ASHIR604]
@4 = ~As for the name Aribeth, I have no knowledge of her. Was she a companion of yours?~ [ASHIR605]
@5 = ~MT: She was once a hero of Neverwinter. And then she betrayed us by going over to Morag.~ /*She was a hero of our people, once. Until she fell and betrayed us to Morag.*/
@6 = ~She is a foul traitor in the service of Morag!~
@7 = ~Morag? That name is known to me - the queen of the scaled raiders! Her face has haunted my dreams, her voice hissing whispered promises of power to tempt me to turn against my people.~ [ASHIR606]
@8 = ~But I am of the Shining Order, sworn in service to Sahaladar, greatest of the floating cities on Azallah. I have sworn to destroy Morag and save my people.~ [ASHIR607]
@9 = ~You remind me of Aribeth.~
@10 = ~You speak of many places I have never heard of.~
@11 = ~How did you get here?~
@12 = ~Why do you want to kill Morag?~
@13 = ~I've heard this tale before. I'll just kill you before you betray me.~
@14 = ~Goodbye.~
@15 = ~I am not Aribeth - I am Asheera. And yet, there are many worlds and planes of existence drawn together in this strange place.~ [ASHIR623]
@16 = ~All who dwell among the islands of Azallah know of Sahaladar, the foam kissed city above the sea. The spires of my home glimmer and sparkle like coral beneath the azure waters.~ [ASHIR608]
@17 = ~After much searching the magicians of Sahaladar discovered a portal in my world - a gate leading to this pseudo-plane where many universes converge.~ [ASHIR615]
@18 = ~The Old Ones seek to return to the world of their birth, but to do this they need slaves and resources gathered from other, weaker worlds.~ [ASHIR617]
@19 = ~Asheera, guardian of Sahaladar, is no traitor! Throughout the isles of Azallah my word is my bond, and none question my honor!~ [ASHIR627]
@20 = ~Save it. I don't trust you and you must die!~
@21 = ~Wait - before you go there is something I must tell you. Please, you must listen - my time grows short!~
@22 = ~What is it that you must tell me?~
@23 = ~Forget it. I'm not listening to you!~
@24 = ~It may be that the one you call Aribeth is my parallel in your world - or I am her parallel, if you prefer. Perhaps that is why we have been brought together.~ [ASHIR624]
@25 = ~What do you mean?~
@26 = ~Aribeth betrayed me - I can't take the same chance with you. You must die!~
@27 = ~In the depths beneath our floating island is the wondrous capital of the Kilm, the water breathers with whom we peacefully share our world.~ [ASHIR609]
@28 = ~Six were chosen to come through the portal, though we knew we could not return. My companions have long since fallen.~ [ASHIR616]
@29 = ~Morag set the scaled raiders loose upon my homeworld. Azallah had never faced so terrible a foe; their savage cruelty was as alien as their appearance.~ [ASHIR618]
@30 = ~Damn your mistrust! I could have helped you defeat the scaled Queen, but now it is too late! The spell that binds me here fades, and my spirit cannot remain in this plane.~
@31 = ~The Queen of the scaled raiders still lives, but the spell that brought me to this place grows weak. Soon it will fail and my spirit will be wrenched from this plane back to my homeworld of Azallah.~
@32 = ~I will never reach Morag's inner sanctum, and the magical artifact forged by my people to slay the Queen will be wasted - unless I give the artifact to you.~
@33 = ~Give me the artifact. I'll use it to help defeat Morag.~
@34 = ~What does this artifact do?~
@35 = ~You say this Aribeth betrayed her faith, she was lost to Morag's evil. Perhaps we have met so that I may help you avenge her fall.~ [ASHIR625]
@36 = ~When I joined the Shining Order, I swore a vow to defend Sahaladar. But now I have disgraced my vows and failed in my sworn duty.~
@37 = ~I alone am left of the champions of my people, but like my fallen companions I too have failed.~ [ASHIR616]
@38 = ~Failed? How have you failed?~
@39 = ~The scaled raiders stripped my defenseless world of its magical treasures and many of my people were sacrificed in bizarre rituals to feed the power of their queen.~ [ASHIR619]
@40 = ~And you have come seeking vengeance.~
@41 = ~My time here grows short. Quickly - take this amulet! It will help protect you against Morag and her people.~
@42 = ~I am a true knight of the Shining Order of Sahaladar. Perhaps I have been brought here from Azallah to redeem the memory of Aribeth, that her soul may be cleansed of its sins by my actions.~ [ASHIR626]
@43 = ~MT: The queen of the scaly aggressors is still alive, but the spell that brought me to this place is weakening. Soon its action will cease, my spirit will be torn out of this plan and transferred to my homeland, to Azalla. I will never reach the inner sanctuary of Morag, and the magical artifact forged by my people for the queen will go to waste - unless I give it to you.~ /*The Queen of the scaled raiders still lives, but the spell that brought me to this place grows weak. Soon it will fail and my spirit will be wrenched from this plane back to my homeworld of Azallah.*/
@44 = ~Vengeance is but one reason I am here. My world was peaceful - and vulnerable. That is why we were among the first to suffer.~ [ASHIR620]
@45 = ~My time here grows short; perhaps I can help you to do what I cannot. But if you do not help me then my mission will have failed.~
@46 = ~But as Morag's strength grows, more of the Old Ones awaken. Soon a conquering army of her minions will pour forth to reclaim their homeworld.~ [ASHIR621]
@47 = ~Then Morag will enslave world after world and all will know the suffering of Azallah. I came here to prevent this, but I have failed.~ [ASHIR622]
@48 = ~May the ocean foam froth red with the blood of the scaled raiders!~ [ASHIR630]
