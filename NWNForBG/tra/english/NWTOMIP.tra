@0 = ~Yer ugly and you smell like a rotting skunk! Hee hee! When we meet again, I'm not going to play friendship anymore!~ [NWTOMITT]
@1 = ~Wha-aat? Are you kidding me? You want to break up a great team?~ [NWTOMIDN]
@2 = ~Yes. Go.~
@3 = ~No. Stay.~
@4 = ~Oh, fine, fine. I'll hang about here for a little while, then, just in case you change your mind.~
@5 = ~Go back to the the Trade of Blades.~
@6 = ~I'll find you at Kendrack's Barracks.~
@7 = ~Wait right here.~
@8 = ~Fair enough. Back to the adventure!~
@9 = ~I figured they'd drag your carcass back here eventually, m'<LADYLORD>. You need me to come with ya again?~ [NWTOM060]
@10 = ~Yep.~
@11 = ~No.~
@12 = ~Lead the way!~
@13 = ~Well, you know where I'll be, then.~
@14 = ~Well, now, if it isn't <CHARNAME>! Glad I am to see you! Isn't the country wonderful this time of year? So much better than the city with all that... umm... burning and dying. You know.~ [NWTOM053]
@15 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Tomi.~
@16 = ~You again? Are you following me around?~
@17 = ~Goodbye.~
@18 = ~Okay. What questions do you have? After you and I went our separate ways, Miss Aribeth there approached me and gave me plenty of money to hop along on this pony ride of hers. We're all supposed to help with the search. Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?~ 
@19 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@20 = ~How much would it cost to hire your services?~
@21 = ~Well... maybe just a little. After all, it's not like there's enough employers alive right now that I have them beating down my door, aye? And anyway... I didn't have to chase you, much. Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?~ 
@22 = ~Uh-huh. Toodle-loo!~
@23 = ~I've already been paid by Miss Aribeth... and good coin, too, I might add. You'd think this Nasher fellow belched gold at will. I was just told that I'm supposed to help out wherever I can. How sweet and unspecific is that? I, uh, don't suppose you actually want something, do you?~ 
@24 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@25 = ~I could use a good rogue by my side.~
@26 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@27 = ~Okey-dokey! If you find yourself in need of a rougue, I'm already bought and paid for... just need to know where the party is.~
@28 = ~Nothing more than anyone, no. You ask me, though, Luskan's the place to look.~
@29 = ~Luskan?~
@30 = ~Well, isn't it a coincidence that I happen to be a good rogue? Fine... this one-rabbit town was beginning to bore me, anyway.~
@31 = ~Besides a bath? Suit yourself, m'<LADYLORD>.~
@32 = ~Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself. What better place for a frog to hide than amongst toads? Not that I've any evidence to back that up, or anything.~ 
@33 = ~Heya, m'<LADYLORD>! Decided to wander back to Tomi Undergallows once again, did ya? This job of Miss Aribeth's... looking for them cult fellows... it's been pretty sweet so far. Haven't had to do much 'cept stare at people all suspicious-like.~ [NWTOM055] 
@34 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@35 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@36 = ~Do you intend to just sit around here, then?~
@37 = ~Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know? Anyhow, Miss Aribeth heaped a bunch of coin on me to come join this search. Pretty sweet job, so far.~ 
@38 = ~Well, I wouldn't get a lot done running off on my own, m'<LADYLORD>. Heck, I was just told to come here and wait until somebody needed me. I'm no hero like you are, m'<LADYLORD>... though I am a darn good rogue, if I do say so myself. This town is kind of boring. So far I've counted fourteen chickens that crossed the road. I suppose, if you needed me, I'd be happy to tag along with ya.~ 
@39 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra body. You're in.~
@40 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@41 = ~All righty, then, m'<LADYLORD>... I'm all yours. If ya need me to do something other than what I'm doing, just give me a shout.~
