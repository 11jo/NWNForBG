@0 = ~A well observed day to ye, friend. Charwood does not see many visitors of your refined appearance. Or at all, actually.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I will answer, though I find your words very... I guess I find your speech very modern. The Mayor would probably help you better than I.~
@4 = ~What can you tell me about Charwood?~
@5 = ~I seek the cult that prolonged the Neverwinter plague.~
@6 = ~Have you heard any strange rumors?~ 
@7 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time... and another...~
@8 = ~Oh, I'm sure there is little that I could tell you. It's a simple place, really... It has too many stories as it is...~
@9 = ~Charwood seems pretty isolated. Who protects you?~
@10 = ~Who are the important people in town?~
@11 = ~Do you have shops? Merchants?~
@12 = ~I don't know anything about that... Neverwinter, you say? Seems like only yesterday they were talking about that elf, Halueth Never founding the place. I'm sorry, I haven't heard of any cult. We are kept isolated... Well, what I mean to say is that we prefer to keep to ourselves.~ 
@13 = ~Where are your guards? Perhaps they know?~
@14 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@15 = ~We don't hear of anything. Outside news could bring change, and things must stay like this or everything ends. I... I can't talk about this. Just go talk to Mayor Mobley. He'll listen to your stories. You have so many... like Quint did... Things like that bring change...~ 
@16 = ~Where can I find the Mayor?~
@17 = ~Who is Quint?~
@18 = ~Well, I guess you mean Castle Jhareg. Lords Karlat and Quint Jhareg founded this place, and made it safe for us to live under their will. Please, you should tell your story to the Mayor. What goes on in Castle Jhareg is not to be spoken of. It might bring change, and nobody wants that.~
@19 = ~Are you afraid of the Lords Jhareg?~
@20 = ~Who's Karlat?~
@21 = ~Look, listening to people's stories is Mayor Mobley's job, now. He's got answers for every question... even the tricky ones that Quint likes to pose...~
@22 = ~Tell me more about Charwood.~
@23 = ~Hmm? Oh, no. No commerce at all, really. Just the occasional barter for service. No one trades anything here but stories and even then... I'm sorry... you'll have to find somewhere else. There's a trading outpost that just formed not far from here... Port Llast, I believe?~
@24 = ~Just formed? Port Llast is years old.~
@25 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@26 = ~We have no need of guards... except the one at the castle gate, of course. The Lords Jhareg keep us safe... The Lords Jhareg are why we are here. But you should not speak of Jhareg business. It might bring change. It might end things.~ 
@27 = ~You should be talking to Mayor Mobley. I can't say any more. People tell too many stories. People want too many things. Like that Quint.~
@28 = ~What does the gate guard protect you from?~
@29 = ~Why, he's in the town hall, like he... like he always is... Never leaving... never living... just this endless sleep...~
@30 = ~Do not speak of him! He's mad! He will destroy everything, everything! And he'll trap you here like all of us... He... He will... I... I'm sorry, but I don't remember what we were talking about. Really, it's weird? I don't remember anything...~ 
@31 = ~You don't understand. The telling of tales will lead only to trouble - Just ask Quint! Please, go talk to Mayor Mobley.~
@32 = ~I... No, that's not right... it's been... I don't know how long it's been. That's not right. Wait... there was something... Stopped... frozen... It was a good story! Everything was going well until he brought it to an end... we all continue to live happily ever after... forever...~ 
@33 = ~The guard? At the castle gate? I... I don't remember... He's new here... Mayor Mobley hired him... He protects us from... from change...~
@34 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go off like that. I'm just confused. Anyway, I'm sure you'll find what you need in Port Llast.~
@35 = ~Hello there. I hope a good thought has brought you our way? Charwood has not seen a new face is a very long time.~
@36 = ~What you talking about? You just see me earlier.~
@37 = ~I know my own mind. I haven't seen anyone new until I spoke with you right now. I'm sure of it... I'm sure... Time moves slowly here... almost stops... He stopped it... stopped all the dying... But... But it was too late for the... for the children...~ 
@38 = ~I'm sorry... I lost my thoughts for a moment there. It's a pleasure to meet you.~
