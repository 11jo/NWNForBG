@0 = ~This chamber has been formed of marble and complex crystals within its core, containing two depressions along its edge. It practically crackles with dormant magical energy.~
@1 = ~Examine the depressions.~
@2 = ~NP: Insert the golem control rod into the recess.~ /*Put the Golem Control Rod into a depression.*/
@3 = ~NP: Insert the golem production rod into the recess.~ /*Put the Golem Replication Rod into a depression.*/

@5 = ~Leave the chamber alone.~
@6 = ~The two depressions are long and slender, very likely receptacles awaiting something to be placed within them.~
@7 = ~NP: A small rod is now inserted into one of the recesses. The camera buzzed impatiently, as if it were waiting for something else.~ /*One of the depressions has been filled with a small rod. The chamber hums with activity, appearing to await something else.*/
@8 = ~The rod slides easily into place, stopping with a faint click. It begins to glow slightly and the chamber hums... though it does nothing as of yet.~
@9 = ~NP: The second wand comes into place next to the first and stops with a slight click. Both wands suddenly begin to glow brightly, and the camera comes to life....~ /*The second rod slides into place beside the first, stopping with a faint click. Both rods begin to shine brilliantly, the chamber leaping to life...*/
@10 = ~You attempt to strike the chamber, but your blow slides harmlessly off an invisible barrier next to its surface.~
@11 = ~You turn away from the strange structure.~
@12 = ~This chamber is smoking every so slightly. Both rods in its depressions are blackened, burnt-out husks. Whatever magic fueled this chamber appears to have spent itself.~
