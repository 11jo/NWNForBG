@0 = ~Yes? Is there something you require? Please do be brief as your unwashed appearance leaves me to worry what infections you might be carrying...~
@1 = ~Could I trouble you with some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose one still needs to breathe amidst one's mourning - Perhaps in helping you I am also helping my friends' spirits find their rest.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~Can you tell me anything about the plague?~
@6 = ~Is there anything odd that you have heard?~
@7 = ~Fare thee well. I must return to my private mourning - It is the only way I have to grieve.~
@8 = ~I don't usually have much regard for those that lose their way, but... well, the Wailing changes everything, doesn't it...~
@9 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@10 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@11 = ~I have lost my two closest friends to it already. The Helmites say they must be cremated rather than buried - but they did the Blacklake proud, at least...~
@12 = ~Has the plague disrupted the social order of the city?~
@13 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@14 = ~There's another question.~
@15 = ~The gossip of the nobility need not concern you, and likely wouldn't be the type of information you want anyway. The different districts will each hold intrigues, I am sure. All but the Blacklake seem to do as they will once out from under the rule of law.~ 
@16 = ~Neverwinter has always been divided into separate Districts but, with the militia maintaining the quarantine at every gate, it has become all the more apparent. Which of the five is of interest to you? The Beggar's Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, or the City Core?~ 
@17 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@18 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@19 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@20 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@21 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula.~
@22 = ~If you'll be using that equipment to avenge my friends or bring about a cure for us all, I'll gladly point you in the right direction.~
@23 = ~Disrupted? The privileged do not take well to change - Why, captains of commerce are falling just as quick as their menial workers. It won't be tolerated. The inaction of Lord Nasher and those under him will not hinder the nobilty from protecting their own.~ 
@24 = ~The great unwashed have been kept ignorant of bungled efforts by city officials to contain the disease, and for good reason. Components for a cure were lost to an attack. Can you imagine the panic if people knew that someone is actually fighting against the cure? Of course, I have heard nothing of suspects or leads. What are we coming to if the nobility cannot expect to be kept updated?~ 
@25 = ~The City Core is where we are now and is one of the only districts where the plague has not made much headway. Our more important institutions are located around Castle Never in the "upper square," the center of Neverwinter's government.~ 
@26 = ~The Beggar's Nest is where the Wailing first laid its claim upon the city and it remains the worst afflicted... Not that it had been pleasant before.~
@27 = ~I hear it is now infested with zombies of the plague-dead - It serves the lower classes right for cursing us with such a dreadful pox!~
@28 = ~There was even an infestation of undead that erupted. Gods know what they did in there to cause that. Thankfully one of the new recruits in the city militia dealt with the problem.~
@29 = ~A friend of mine, a warehouser, says business is at a standstill there - The Wailing has left idle hands about, leading to mischief among the laborers.~
@30 = ~I even heard the area has fallen under the control of gangs of thugs and pirates, though whether this is true or simply an exaggeration I couldn't say.~
@31 = ~Thieves were running absolutely rampant as well, but one of the newer city militia recruits put a stop to it. Admirable, whoever it was.~
@32 = ~The Blacklake district - My friends lived and now have died there... The militia won't let me attend the funeral, though they said they'd pass on my regards.~
@33 = ~But beyond my personal affection for my home, the Blacklake is where the best hope of beating the plague will arise... but that is not for your ears.~
@34 = ~Certainly you can tell me.~
@35 = ~I understand there was trouble there recently but someone has put an end to it. Even so, the guards will not allow me to attend my friends' funerals.~
@36 = ~I suppose I could mention a detail or two. It's not as though it hasn't been bandied about among my circle. You see, Blacklake will not fall to the plague quietly. There have been measures taken, stockpiling and... certain acquisitions... I can't say much more, but my friends have not died in vain. They exposed themselves to the plague that other nobles in the Blacklake might survive.~ 
@37 = ~Are you suggesting a revolt of some sort?~
@38 = ~My friends would have nothing to do with something so barbaric! It was simply a matter of the proper precautions being taken. If you have an opinion on the matter you should go to the district yourself and leave me to mourn the sacrifice.~ 
@39 = ~I have little interest in the Peninsula district's affairs. There is already too much to worry about without fretting over the inmates of its prison. Now there are even rumors of prisoners running free in the streets - You are better off leaving it alone.~ 
@40 = ~I have little interest in the Peninsula district's affairs. There is already too much to worry about without fretting over the inmates of its prison. I mean, gracious me, there were even prisoners running amuck in the streets! I heard the Head Gaoler went insane and turned them all loose! If not for the good recruits of the city militia, the whole thing would have got out of control. Well, out of control enough to affect me, which just isn't an option. I'm told everything is quiet there now.~ 
@41 = ~I get the sense, however, that you seek something larcenous in nature. I'd suggest visiting the Moonstone Mask, near the main exit of the City, to the south east. Not that I have ever been there, and any assumption that I have is merely the wildest of conjecture. Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast is where the adventurers are gathering.~
@42 = ~You seem to move by Nature's hand? Perhaps the Druid Tree in the southwest of the area, near the gate would be a location of interest for you. Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast is where the adventurers are gathering.~
@43 = ~You appear quite strong in your faith. Perhaps you should pay a visit to the Temple of Tyr in the City Core, west of the district, near Castle Never. Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast is where the adventurers are gathering.~
@44 = ~Are scrolls and incantations your interest? You might wish to make yourself known at the Cloaktower east if the district. Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast is where the adventurers are gathering.~
@45 = ~You look quick with a weapon. The Shining Knight Arms and Armor may have what you are looking for. It's just south of the main square. Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast is where the adventurers are gathering.~
@46 = ~You must have many talents. Warriors should visit The Shining Knight Arms and Armor, mages should visit the Cloaktower, for priests we have the Temple of Tyr, those interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Thieves are welcome at the Moonstone Mask. Ah, and If you wish to bolster yourself with a hireling, the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast is where the adventurers are gathering.~
@47 = ~Can you not see that I am in the midst of mourning? Show some respect for your betters, both living and dead!~
