Alas, I fear that my trial will now never be completed, since the talisman - the key to my visions - is lost. This happened shortly after I started working on the docks. I tried to keep my eye on the talisman, but this area is infested with thieves and pickpockets. Ever since it was stolen, I have been constantly looking for a brooch, but how do you find such an item?

Alas, I fear my quest will never be complete now, as the talisman - the key to my visions - is lost.*/
@60 = ~NP: Perhaps the thief who kidnapped her threw her away as soon as he realized what she was worth.

@68 = ~My mother's brooch! Thank you, <CHARNAME> - I can never repay you for this gift. I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer.

@89 = ~There are no great secrets about me, <CHARNAME>; I am what I am. My father was an orc and my mother was an Uthgardt of the Red Tiger tribe.

@92 = ~I will not lie - I was never allowed to forget about my father's tainted orc blood. Yet if the tribe did not embrace me, at least they tolerated me.

And most importantly I learned the honor of a warrior.~ /*Like the other young boys of our tribe I ran and climbed and swam and grew strong. I learned to hunt and fish.

@93 = ~With my mother's death the time came for me to prove myself worthy of the tribe. I left in search of glory and honor in the outside world, to prove my spirit was true. I went to Luskan.

The old man looked at me as he passed, and I saw in his eyes that he knew I was of the Uthgardt - and he knew what I had become. Without warning the old man threw himself at the nearest guard; a foolish gesture of defiance, for he was still shackled and bound.

@142 = ~NP: I wouldn't mind knowing what you think of Aribeth's betrayal. Why did she do it?~ /*I wouldn't mind knowing your thoughts on Aribeth's betrayal. Why do you think she did it?*/
@143 = ~There are some who claim Aribeth betrayed Neverwinter out of grief, others say she seeks to avenge Fenthick's death out of some perverse sense of justice. There are even those who say she was driven mad by Fenthick's execution, and is not aware of what she's doing. But I think something else drives her now.~ /*There are some who claim Aribeth betrayed Neverwinter out of grief, others say she seeks to avenge Fenthick's death out of some perverse sense of justice.*/
@144 = ~What do you think her reason is?~
@145 = ~So are you going to tell me or are you going to make me guess?~
@146 = ~Neverwinter turned its back on her, the city rejected her and its people cast her out. There is no pain so great as being turned away by those you most want to take you in.~
@147 = ~What are you talking about? They never turned her out!~
@148 = ~Go on.~
@149 = ~Perhaps not, but Aribeth no doubt felt that they did. The people blamed Fenthick enough to kill him, how could she not feel they despised her as well? And then lord Nasher sent her to Port Llast with Aarin Gend. It was obvious Lord Nasher wanted an excuse to send her away from the city.~ /*Perhaps not, but Aribeth no doubt felt that they did. The people blamed Fenthick enough to kill him, how could she not feel they despised her as well?*/
@150 = ~No doubt he thought it best to calm the people and keep Aribeth from suffering their wrath as Fenthick had. But in her grief she would have seen it as a cold and brutal rejection - a symbolic banishment.~
@151 = ~That's no excuse for her betrayal!~
@152 = ~Sounds like you think she was justified.~
@153 = ~I am not saying what Aribeth did was right, or even justified. But there is a tale among the Uthgardt, an ancient legend of consequences and betrayal. Fenthick's execution and Aribeth's betrayal remind me of a tale of my own people. I only hope Neverwinter does not suffer the same fate as the Uthgardt.~ /*I am not saying what Aribeth did was right, or even justified. But there is a tale among the Uthgardt, an ancient legend of consequences and betrayal.*/
@154 = ~Perhaps later I will tell you the tale, but now is not the time for me to speak of this. We must focus on finding the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.~
@155 = ~We should focus on finding the Words of Power for Aarin Gend. But I suppose I could spare some time to share with you the legend of my people I mentioned earlier.~
@156 = ~I want to hear it.~
@157 = ~NP: I don't want to hear it, maybe later.~ /*I can't do this on my own!*/
@158 = ~In ancient times all the Uthgardt tribes were one, a mighty nation under the great hero-king Uthgar. Our people were indomitable in battle - none dared stand against Uthgar when he wielded his great spear. It is said no weapon could harm him when he brandished the spear over his head.~ /*Our people were indomitable in battle - none dared stand against Uthgar when he wielded his great spear. It is said no weapon could harm him when he brandished the spear over his head.*/
@159 = ~But against our greatness the armies of our enemies massed - goblins, orcs, ogres, and other creatures too foul to mention. A dark host marched forth from the mountains to battle Uthgar and his people. According to the tale, there was a young boy who desired nothing more than to be a great hero of the Uthgardt. When news of the invasion came, he swore he would join the ranks of men as a warrior.~ /*According to the tale, there was a young boy who desired nothing more than to be a great hero of the Uthgardt. When news of the invasion came, he swore he would join the ranks of men as a warrior.*/
@160 = ~He was a mere child, not even a youth, and the warriors told him to stay with the woman and infants. But the boy was brave and stubborn, and he would not accept this.~
@161 = ~What did the boy do?~
@162 = ~The night before the battle, the boy crept into Uthgar's tent and stole his magic spear. Then the boy marched out in the darkness to face the horde alone. But he was a child. He did not even know where he was going, and he soon became lost in the woods. In the morning, Uthgar woke to find his spear gone. He was forced to march against the enemy without it.~ /*But he was a child. He did not even know where he was going, and he soon became lost in the woods. In the morning, Uthgar woke to find his spear gone. He was forced to march against the enemy without it.*/
@163 = ~The battle raged fierce and bloody and many warriors fell before the enemy broke and fled. But even victory came with a terrible cost, for Uthgar - father of our people - was felled by an arrow through the eye.~
@164 = ~What about the boy with the spear?~
@165 = ~After many days the boy found his way back to the camp. Those who saw him with the spear quickly understood what had happened and they blamed him for Uthgar's death. They cast him out forever, banishing him from the tribe. The boy fled, taking the spear with him. He had only wanted to prove himself a warrior, he had only wanted to help defend the tribe. His motives were honorable. But his actions had tragic consequences, and the Uthgardt could not forgive him. Just as Neverwinter could not forgive Fenthick. But the tale does not end there.~ /*After many days the boy found his way back to the camp. Those who saw him with the spear quickly understood what had happened and they blamed him for Uthgar's death. They cast him out forever, banishing him from the tribe.*/
@166 = ~How does it end?~
@167 = ~The boy vanished; he was never seen again - and neither was Uthgar's Spear, the symbol and source of the Uthgardt nation's power and might. Without the spear my people were vulnerable, and our enemies fell upon us. The great nation of the Uthgardt was splintered into small tribes. Never again would we know the glory of our past.~ /*Without the spear my people were vulnerable, and our enemies fell upon us. The great nation of the Uthgardt was splintered into small tribes. Never again would we know the glory of our past.*/
@168 = ~Had the Uthgardt forgiven the boy, he and the spear would have remained and the empire would have stayed strong. Had Neverwinter forgiven Fenthick, Aribeth might not have betrayed the city she loved.~
@169 = ~I guess I see your point.~
@170 = ~That's not the same! Aribeth didn't just run away. She betrayed us!~
@171 = ~There is a lesson in the fall of the Uthgardt, a lesson Neverwinter would do well to heed. There is hope for the city yet, just as there is hope for the Uthgardt. There is more to the legend of Uthgar's Spear, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps later I will tell you the tale, but now is not the time for me to speak of this. We must focus on finding the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.~ /*Perhaps later I will tell you the tale, but now is not the time for me to speak of this. We must focus on finding the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.*/
@172 = ~I promised to tell you the rest of the tale of Uthgar's Spear when the time was right, <CHARNAME>. That time has now come. As you know, I am on a vision quest to prove myself a true Uthgardt warrior. Last night I had a vision to guide me on my quest. I have seen the spear in my dreams. According to the legends of my people, the Uthgardt tribes will never be united until Uthgar's Spear is found.~ /*As you know, I am on a vision quest to prove myself a true Uthgardt warrior. Last night I had a vision to guide me on my quest.*/
@173 = ~NP: This is how I must prove my prowess to the tribe. I must find Utgar's spear - though I don't know where to look for it. Don't be afraid,<CHARNAME> . As long as you seek the Word of Power, my weapon will serve you. And perhaps by serving you, I will find the Spear of Uthgar. I'm beginning to believe that it was the will of the gods that brought us together.~ /*Do not fear, <CHARNAME>. As long as you seek the Words of Power my blade shall serve you. And in serving you, perhaps I will find Uthgar's Spear.*/
@174 = ~I have a spear here. Is this Uthgar's Spear?~
@175 = ~Don't worry, Daelan. We'll find Uthgar's Spear. I promise.~
@176 = ~This vision quest better not interfere with your duty to me!~
@177 = ~Yes - this is the spear from my dreams! Uthgar's Spear! Because of you I can return to my people with proof my spirit is worthy of the Red Tiger tribe! I can never properly repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>, but please take this small token of my gratitude. It was a gift from my mother before she died.~ /*I can never properly repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>, but please take this small token of my gratitude. It was a gift from my mother before she died.*/
@178 = ~I thank you for this reward, Daelan.~
@179 = ~I feel like I'm getting screwed in this deal.~
@180 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Your promise means much to me, for you are a <MANWOMAN> of true honor. I know my quest will end in success. But for now we must focus on finding the Words of Power. Aarin Gend is counting on us.~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Your promise means much to me, for you are a <MANWOMAN> of true honor. I know my quest will end in success.*/
@181 = ~I have vowed to serve you as long as you have need of my blade, <CHARNAME>. I will not forsake that vow.~
@182 = ~The talisman has powerful magical properties, though I know it is hardly a suitable reward for all you have done for me. Alas, the only other thing I can offer you is my continued service.~
@183 = ~What are you going to do with the spear now, Daelan?~
@184 = ~I will bring Uthgar's Spear back to my tribe and present it to our Council of Elders. I have no doubt they will declare my spirit worthy of the Red Tiger tribe. I imagine my chieftain will summon an inter-tribal council so that all the Uthgardt tribes will know the artifact has been found. This is an event of great importance to my people, <CHARNAME>.~ /*I imagine my chieftain will summon an inter-tribal council so that all the Uthgardt tribes will know the artifact has been found.

@185 = ~According to the legends, the return of Uthgar's Spear heralds the return of Uthgar himself, to be born among our tribes. They say it signals a return to the glory of our ancient past. I cannot say for certain. Perhaps I will be hailed as a hero and showered with riches and honors by the chieftains of my people. Or perhaps I will simply be welcomed back into the tribe. The elders could allow me to take a wife and raise a son of my own amongst the Uthgardt people.~ /*According to the legends, the return of Uthgar's Spear heralds the return of Uthgar himself, to be born among our tribes.

@186 = ~Either would be pleasing to me, <CHARNAME>. I have proven myself worthy and for the first time I feel truly at peace with my place in the world.~
@187 = ~I'm going to miss you, Daelan.~
@188 = ~So you mean you're just going to abandon me now?~
@189 = ~I long to return to my people, <CHARNAME>, and reclaim my place among my tribe. But I will not abandon you, or break my promise to serve. As long as you have need of me I will stay by your side and aid you in the search for the Words of Power.

@191 = ~I have little knowledge of these lands. My tribe is far from here, though I did pass through the Elk tribe territory near Fort Ilkard on my journey to Neverwinter.~
@192 = ~What can you tell me about the Elk tribe and Fort Ilkard?~
@193 = ~The Elk tribe are of the Uthgardt people, as was my mother's own tribe, though their territory is to the south of Neverwinter. Like all the Uthgardt they are hunters and warriors who live off the land. I cannot imagine why the Elk tribe would suddenly ally itself with the Luskan forces.

@195 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@196 = ~I have only met the leader of the Elk Tribe once, a great chieftain named Zokan Thunderer. He struck me as a noble and honorable man - a true Uthgardt. We Uthgardt are warriors, not savages.

@201 = ~The signs are clear, <CHARNAME>. We march toward a great battle against a foe we may not be able to defeat. If I am to face my possible death with honor there are words I must say to you.
