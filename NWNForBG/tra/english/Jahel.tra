@23 = ~A man of mystery. While I love an intrigue, today is just too bleak a moment in my life to give you proper attention. Can I help you?~
@24 = ~NP: I wish I could help you, but my mind is too tired and it's very hard for me to concentrate on anything but my own problems.~ /*I wish I could help you, kind <PRO_MANWOMAN>, but my mind is overwrought and it is very difficult for me to focus on anything other than my own troubles.*/

@28 = ~NP: It's so awful. I had to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a present for his tenth birthday. He was so excited that he ran ahead of me the whole time. He ran up a hill and then suddenly screamed. I ran with all my legs to the top of the hill, but when I ran closer, I heard men's voices. I fell to the ground and looked out from behind the hilltop.~ /*It is so horrible. I was supposed to bring my little brother Neva into town to buy him a birthday present for his tenth birthday. He was so excited he kept running ahead of me.*/
@29 = ~NP: Neva was surrounded by a gang of robbers. They grabbed him and dragged him off laughing. I just don't know who to turn to.

@34 = ~NP: I don't want a band of brigands to slit my throat. Goodbye.~ /*That's rough, but I'm not really interested in getting my throat slit by a gang of thugs. Goodbye.*/
@35 = ~I imagine it is because he had his birthday money in his purse. He had 10 gold pieces to spend for his birthday. That is a lot, so the bandits probably figured he was from a wealthy home and they want to ransom him.~
@36 = ~Yes. I quietly followed them to some standing stones in the hills just outside of Charwood. I thought for sure they would catch me, but I was lucky.~
@37 = ~I have 300 gold, which I would reward anyone who could save my baby brother.~
@38 = ~My hero! Thank you so much for being brave. I must admit, that if you are able to rescue my baby brother, there are rewards besides gold that I would be willing to discuss.~
@39 = ~NP: I know Neva is being held in a bandit camp near the vertical rocks near Charwood, but I don't know exactly how many people are guarding it or what we can expect from them. Please hurry! Bring him to me safely!~ /*I know Neva is being held at a bandit camp near some standing stones just outside of Charwood, but I have no idea how many people are holding him or what exactly to expect.*/
@40 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@41 = ~A young man by the name of Neva has apparently been kidnapped by bandits. According to his siblings, Tarran and Jaheel, he is being held near some standing stones by the entrance to the Charwood. Adventurers are to meet the siblings there to attempt a rescue.~
@42 = ~NP: Consider Neva already saved. Don't worry.~ /*Neva is as good as rescued. Do not worry, my lady.*/

@44 = ~I can't remember where you said that stone formation was.~
@45 = ~Not yet, but I'm working on it.~
