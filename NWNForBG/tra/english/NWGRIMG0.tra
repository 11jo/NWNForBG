@0 = ~Ugh! I'm fed up with your virtue! You're a pathetic parody of a friend. If we meet again, believe me, it will be in a fight!~ 
@1 = ~Together we can sow death and destruction throughout the North. Why would you break up our partnership and deny the Silent Lord his due?~ [NWGRIMBD]
@2 = ~You're a sick and evil man, Grimgnaw. Too evil for my taste.~ 
@3 = ~I just think it's time we parted ways.~
@4 = ~I've changed my mind. Stick with me and we'll leave a trail of bodies across the land!~ 
@5 = ~You are an agent of death, <CHARNAME>, just as I am. We both serve the Silent Lord in our own fashion, though you refuse to acknowledge what you are. We part now, but you are destined to swim in an ocean of blood. Our fates are intertwined, and I shall wait here for your inevitable return so we may once more join together to perform the will of the Silent Lord. Maybe me could meets with owner?~ 
@6 = ~Go back to the Trade of Blades.~
@7 = ~I'll find you at Kendrack's Barracks.~ 
@8 = ~Wait right here.~ 
@9 = ~We part now, but you are destined to swim in an ocean of blood. Our fates are intertwined, and I shall wait here for your inevitable return so we may once more join together to perform the will of the Silent Lord. Where can we meet if you change your mind?~ 
@10 = ~Well spoken, <CHARNAME>. I tremble in anticipation of the carnage we shall unleash upon the Realms!~
@11 = ~I have been waiting for you - I suspected you would return. Do you need me to join with you once more?~ [NWGRIM60]
@12 = ~Yep.~
@13 = ~No.~
@14 = ~Then together we shall rain blood and death down upon the world.~
@15 = ~You are an agent of destruction and a messenger of death. Should you change your mind come back to me here and I will gladly join with you again.~
@16 = ~We meet again, <CHARNAME>. I taste a storm of slaughter on the air; I'm not surprised to find you here at the center of the whirlwind.~ [NWGRIM53]
@17 = ~What are you doing here, Grimgnaw?~ 
@18 = ~You again? Are you following me like some kind of pathetic lost puppy?~
@19 = ~Goodbye.~
@20 = ~When we parted ways, <CHARNAME>, I meant to return to my Order. But I bow to the Silent Lord and I discovered I could best serve his will by staying in Neverwinter for the time being. I am eager to find and slaughter those who unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter. Thousands were taken by the disease, their essence stolen from the grasp of true Death.~ 
@21 = ~Ultimately I follow no one but the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. I have been drawn here in the service of my master, Death.~
@22 = ~Return to me if you require an ally in your mission. Together we can help sow the seeds of destruction throughout the land and reap a harvest of agony and death.~
@23 = ~That was why I answered Lord Nasher's desperate call for mercenaries to come to Port Llast. He is also anxious to root out those behind the Wailing Death.~
@24 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@25 = ~How much would it cost to hire your services?~
@26 = ~When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists. Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?~ 
@27 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@28 = ~I could use a priest.~ 
@29 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@30 = ~Their location is well hidden. However, I would not be surprised to learn they are connected with the village of Charwood.~
@31 = ~Charwood?~
@32 = ~What is this place?~
@33 = ~Then together we shall sow death and destruction throughout the land in our quest to destroy those behind the Wailing Death.~
@34 = ~The town has isolated itself from the rest of the world, far to the South of Port Llast. Few outside my Order even remember such a place exists. The town is a strange place; there is a foul taint upon it that we of the Long Death can feel. None of the emissaries my Order has sent south to investigate Charwood has ever returned.~ 
@35 = ~It would not surprisie me to discover links to the cult behind the Wailing Death in that unnatural place. Is there more I can do for you, <CHARNAME>?~
@36 = ~We meet again, <CHARNAME>. It is I, Grimgnaw of the Order of the Long Death. Surely you must remember me. I have been eagerly waiting for my chance to extract vengeance on the cult responsible for unleashing the plague on Neverwinter.~ [NWGRIM55] 
@37 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@38 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@39 = ~If you're so interested in vengeance, why are you standing around here?~
@40 = ~I am eager to punish those who unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter. Thousands were taken by the disease, their essence stolen from the grasp of true Death.~
@41 = ~Running helter skelter on my own would do little to locate the cult, and even less to further the cause of Death, whom I serve. Your reputation is well known, <CHARNAME>. I have heard many tales of the slaughter you rain down upon those who dare oppose you.~ 
@42 = ~The mark of Death is upon you. If we join together we shall unleash a storm of devastation to ravage the North and feed the eternal hunger of the Silent Lord.~
@43 = ~I guess I could use a homicidal priest at my side. You're in.~
@44 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
