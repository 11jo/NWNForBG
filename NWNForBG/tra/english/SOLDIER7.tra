@0 = ~MT: Are you here to help us? We will need any help. Luskan's troops have a numerical advantage of at least ten to one. But I'm just a simple soldier. You need to talk to Trancar, the battalion commander.~ /*Have you come to help us? We need all the help we can get. Luskan's got us outnumbered ten to one at least.*/
@1 = ~MT: If not for the catapults crushing our ranks, we would be able to resist these Luskan scum! But how can you fight when boulders are falling on your head and boiling pitch is pouring? That is why Trancar ordered us to retreat.~ /*But how can you fight when it's raining boulders and flaming pitch all around you? That's why Trancar had the battalion pull back.*/
@2 = ~MT: These war golems are unstoppable, trust me! Even Trankar didn't fight those monsters! So he ordered a retreat and brought the battalion here.~ /*Even Trancar knew better than to fight those monstrosities! That's why he had the battalion pull back to here.*/
@3 = ~MT: Now that the golems have been killed and the catapults broken, we have a chance to defeat those Luskan dogs! I hope Trancar sends me on a mission soon! Enemies will not even have time to understand what happened!~ /*With the golems stopped and the catapults broken, we've got a fighting chance against those Luskan dogs!*/
