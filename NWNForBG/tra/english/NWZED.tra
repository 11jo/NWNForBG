@0 = ~This better be important as I don't feel like chatting. It's bad enough my leg is killing me, but now I gotta be a witness at this murder trial too!~
@1 = ~Trial? What trial?~
@2 = ~I'm the defense counsel for Rolgan.~
@3 = ~What happened to your leg?~
@4 = ~Bad news. Wages have been cut. You have to give back 100 gold from your salary.~
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~I'm just a witness in the case. Go talk to Neurik at the Temple of Tyr if you want the details.~
@7 = ~Huh, so you're the sucker Neurik roped into defending that savage? Tough break. I hear the case is open and shut. I saw that Uthgardt stab Griff with my own two eyes. Ran him right through. Griff was dead before he even hit the ground.~
@8 = ~Do you know why they were fighting?~
@9 = ~My leg is none of your business! Go find someone else to bother. Leave me alone.~
@10 = ~100 gold? This is outrageous! That's half a month's wages! How do they expect me to survive? I've got a bad leg. I'm on disability leave right now. They can't expect an injured soldier to hand over that kind of gold, can they?~
@11 = ~Not my problem. Just hand over the gold.~
@12 = ~Tell you what, since you're injured I'll let you keep your wages.~
@13 = ~You expect me to believe a story like that? Give me a break. I have a leg wound, not a head injury. Go sell your story somewhere else. I have to rest up for this trial.~
@14 = ~Hand over your gold or I'll rip that injured leg right off!~
@15 = ~Trial? What trial?~
@16 = ~Go find someone else to bother. Leave me alone.~
@17 = ~Gambling debt. Griff had won a bunch of money off that Uthgardt and I guess the savage didn't like it. He'd been drinking, so I guess it's no surprise he lost his temper.~
@18 = ~Anything else you can tell me?~
@19 = ~I get the feeling you're holding back on me.~
@20 = ~Fine - here's your damn gold. I don't think this is fair, though. And I'm getting mighty sick of being taken advantage of!~
@21 = ~Well, that's something at least. Now maybe I can get some peace - my leg is killing me and I have to rest up for that trial.~
@22 = ~Trial? What trial?~
@23 = ~Blah, blah, blah. Blowhards who toss threats around don't scare me. Go find someone else to bother. Leave me alone.~
@24 = ~Hey, all I know is what I saw. Griff is dead, and that Uthgardt killed him. I'm as sure of that as I am of this pain eating away at my leg!~
@25 = ~What's wrong with your leg?~
@26 = ~If I find out you're holding anything back, the pain won't only be in your leg!~
@27 = ~Arthritis in my knee. There's nothing anyone can do about that. But that ain't the problem right now. Some damn fool stuck me in the thigh with a knife during a bar fight and the wound's infected. Feels like a hot spear shooting up through my whole leg with every step I take.~
@28 = ~And I can't even go to the temple to get it looked at, or they'll know I was in a fight. My unit commander's already warned me about brawling, and I don't need to get stuck on latrine duty again.~
@29 = ~I've got a few healing spells of my own. Maybe I can help.~
@30 = ~You want to heal my leg? What's in it for you?~
@31 = ~I think you know something about Griff's death you aren't telling me.~
@32 = ~You think I'm going to betray the memory of my friend just because of a little pain in my - OW! Damn! I barely bumped it that time and its burning like the fires of the Nine Hells! Okay, you got a deal. Heal my leg and I'll tell you something about Griff. Something you can use at the trial.~
@33 = ~Here, drink this potion, you'll be good as new.~
@34 = ~I changed my mind. I think I'll let you suffer.~
@35 = ~Huh, I still got the arthritis in my knee, but I can cope with that. It was that bloody infection I couldn't handle. Okay, I guess you delivered on your end of the deal, so here's what I know... First, Griff spiked that Uthgardt's drink. Griff was always doing stuff like that to try and get an edge at cards. Could be the stuff in the drink made that Uthgardt act like he did.~
@36 = ~You miserable little bastard! Well I hope you lose your damn case!~
@37 = ~I also happen to know for a fact that Griff was cheating that night. He wanted to take everything that Uthgardt owned. He told me he wanted to rob that savage blind. That's all I know. If it's enough to get your client off, so be it. At least now I can walk without clenching my teeth in agony. It seems like a fair trade to me...~
@38 = ~Hey, thanks for curing that wound in my leg. I still got the occasional ache from my arthritis, but I can handle that.~
@39 = ~What did happen that night with Griff?~
@40 = ~First, Griff spiked that Uthgardt's drink. Griff was always doing stuff like that to try and get an edge at cards. Could be the stuff in the drink made that Uthgardt act like he did. I also happen to know for a fact that Griff was cheating that night. He wanted to take everything that Uthgardt owned. He told me he wanted to rob that savage blind.~
@41 = ~Travel well.~
@42 = ~That's all I know. If it's enough to get your client off, so be it. At least now I can walk without clenching my teeth in agony. It seems like a fair trade to me...~
@43 = ~Tough break on that trial, <CHARNAME>. I know it's a little late now, but I can't help wondering if Griff didn't have it coming to him. Guess we'll never know, since Rolgan's collecting flies on a post out by the church.~
@44 = ~NP: Heard this Utgardt was acquitted, impressive. In the name of the abyss, even I practically believed that Utgardt was innocent.~ /*Wow, <CHARNAME>, a unanimous verdict. Hell, you even had me half-convinced that Uthgardt was innocent.*/
@45 = ~You again? I already gave you 50 gold - that's all I got! So shove off and leave me alone.~ /*You again? I already gave you 50 gold - that's all I got!*/
@46 = ~NP: Are you again? Get out and leave me alone.~ /*So shove off and leave me alone.*/
@47 = ~Right, sir. Well, it's like Lodar said. Griff was outside, we heard him shout, we run out and the Uthgardt sticks a blade in Griff's belly. Then that savage runs off to the Temple for sanctuary like some kind of coward!~
@48 = ~NP: Im ready for questions.~ /*That be enough questions.*/
@49 = ~You never actually witnessed the start of the fight, did you?~
@50 = ~Don't you think Rolgan's judgment was impaired by all the alcohol he had consumed?~
@51 = ~Griff had spiked Rolgan's drink that night, right Zed?~
@52 = ~Rolgan lost a lot of money that night, didn't he Zed? Can you explain that?~
@53 = ~I have no more questions for this witness.~
@54 = ~No, I didn't see who started the fight. So, yeah, it could have been Griff, if that's what you're getting at.~
@55 = ~Sure, he was drunk. But that don't mean you get to go kill people. You have to know how to hold your drinks, right? Know your limits.~
@56 = ~Yeah, he put something in Rolgan's drink. Made his mind fuzzy, so he didn't really understand what he was doing.~
@57 = ~Don't you think that that's a mitigating circumstance in what happened?~
@58 = ~Griff cheated. He wanted to win so he could humilate that Uthgardt; embarass and ruin him. So he cheated during the card game.~
@59 = ~Don't you think that might have been a factor in Griff's death?~
@60 = ~I don't know what "mitigating" means, but Griff shouldn't have spiked that Uthgardt's drink. That's wrong... Griff was always doing stupid stuff like that.~
@61 = ~I warned Griff that that Uthgardt would be mad after losing everything he owned. I said it would lead to trouble, but Griff didn't care. He said he welcomed trouble with the Uthgardt.~
@62 = ~Maybe Griff attacked Rolgan because he thought his cheating had been discovered.~
@63 = ~If Griff thought someone was coming to settle a score, he wouldn't wait. Griff would make sure he made the first move. He preferred to start fights himself, you know?~
