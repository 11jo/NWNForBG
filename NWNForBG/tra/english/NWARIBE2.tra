@46 = ~Without a doubt. You have faced tasks of similar danger, however, and excelled... and will no doubt face much worse before this threat is ended. You did agree to aid Lord Nasher, did you not? Whatever your reasons, I find it hard to believe that you expected this to be very simple.~ [NWARI317] /*Without a doubt. You have faced tasks of similar danger, however, and excelled... and will no doubt face much worse before this threat is ended.*/
@47 = ~Both Aarin and I will join you in Luskan, of course. Aarin will be there to help you enter the tower, <CHARNAME>. As for me, I have... other plans.~ [NWARI319]
@48 = ~Speak to Aarin Gend, as I said. With luck, he will have a plan to not only get you into the city but into the tower, itself.~ [NWARI323]
@49 = ~I am here to see that Lord Nasher's commands are carried out, while Aarin continues to use his network of spies to gain more information beyond Neverwinter's walls. Admittedly, my own role seems sparse. Part of me thinks that my Lord Nasher simply wishes someone he trusts in this role... while another believes he does not wish to be reminded of Fenthick or my pain. Regardless, we will do all that we can to help you, <CHARNAME>. Do not think your efforts go unrecognized.~ [NWARI300] /*Admittedly, my own role seems sparse. Part of me thinks that my Lord Nasher simply wishes someone he trusts in this role... while another believes he does not wish to be reminded of Fenthick or my pain.*/
@50 = ~Aarin has several ideas on places where the cult may be hidden. Currently he is working on finding a way into the city of Luskan... its gates have been sealed since the plague in Neverwinter began. I suggest you talk to Aarin about where these places might be. Search for any clues about the rise of ancient cults or odd activities. Once a way into Luskan is found, you can search there, as well. If we are fortunate, you will perhaps encounter some part of the cult and gain information as to who they are and where they are based.~ [NWARI303] /*I suggest you talk to Aarin about where these places might be.

@52 = ~The search does continue within the city, <CHARNAME>. Indeed, Lord Nasher is having Neverwinter scoured thoroughly for more traces of the cult.

@53 = ~Desther appears to have been their link in Neverwinter, as you discovered, but of the cult itself we have been able to ascertain little. Aarin is positive that its true heart lies outside of Neverwinter, and that it has yet to show us the extent of its strength. The task ahead of us will, no doubt, be most dangerous... but that makes it all the more necessary that we do not remain ignorant of what this cult is and what it intends.~ [NWARI309] /*The task ahead of us will, no doubt, be most dangerous... but that makes it all the more necessary that we do not remain ignorant of what this cult is and what it intends.*/

@58 = ~Yes, he did, actually.~
@59 = ~I see. I suppose my state is obvious enough. Aarin is far more concerned than is warranted, however... certainly a few bad dreams are not a reason to become alarmed. The servants claim I speak in my sleep and say frightening things. They creep about me cautiously like I have gone mad, and Aarin pays their superstitious twitterings far more heed than he should. After all that has happened with the plague and... and Fenthick, I think a disturbing dream or two is not so surprising, wouldn't you agree, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI362] /*The servants claim I speak in my sleep and say frightening things. They creep about me cautiously like I have gone mad, and Aarin pays their superstitious twitterings far more heed than he should.*/
@60 = ~No, it's not surprising at all.~
@61 = ~These dreams are disturbing enough to keep you from sleep?~
@62 = ~Perhaps you've gone mad. Completely cracked.~
@63 = ~Finally, someone with some sense! I keep telling Aarin that these strange dreams are nothing to be concerned over, but he insists on treating me like an invalid.

I keep telling Aarin that these strange dreams are nothing to be concerned over, but he insists on treating me like an invalid.*/
@64 = ~You don't sound very convinced.~
@65 = ~Now you, too? Has the world gone mad, or is it me? These dreams are... disturbing and frightening, but... they shall pass! They are my burden to bear and no one else's.~ [NWARI371]
@66 = ~Why don't you tell me about these dreams? Maybe it will help.~
@67 = ~Have you considered that maybe it's more serious than that?~
@68 = ~The dreams are simply dreams, no doubt caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear. I will not discuss them... especially not with you.

@70 = ~I... I am falling, in the dream. Always falling. Surrounded by a heavy blackness which chokes and drowns me. Grasping hands reach out to me, and the voices... a cacophony of whispers that plead to me for help. And... and then I see a shrouded figure. It is Fenthick. He is walking away from me and I run to catch him, but always he eludes me in the darkness. The voices get so much louder. They are accusing me, blaming me, and I... I feel ashamed, though I do not know what I am being blamed for. I cry out for help, for them to stop their assault, but I go unheeded.~ [NWARI373] /*The voices get so much louder.

I am... frightened... of what they may mean.~ [NWARI373] /*And then I catch up to the figure... and I see that it is not Fenthick. He turns and gazes at me with sad eyes... and I know it is Tyr... and then my god turns his back on me.*/
@72 = ~That's understandable. They would frighten me, as well.~
@73 = ~It is only fears and worries dredged up by your mind, Aribeth.~
@74 = ~I don't know what to say about that.~
@75 = ~It's all right, <CHARNAME>. There isn't much that can be said, is there? But... I am glad I told you. It makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, somehow. I do feel better for it, thank you. Hah... I am reminded, a little, of how I was introduced to the paladin life. You should ask me to tell you the tale, sometime. Until then, however, let's return to the subject of your task. That is something we can focus on, at least.~ [NWARI386] /*It's all right, <CHARNAME>. There isn't much that can be said, is there? But... I am glad I told you. It makes the dreams seem a bit smaller, somehow.*/
@76 = ~Gone mad, have I? Some restless nights caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear and suddenly I am some raving harpy to be handled with padded gloves? I should have known better than to discuss such a matter with you. Let us return to the topic of your mission and speak of this no more.~ [NWARI389] /*Gone mad, have I? Some restless nights caused by more sorrow than my heart can bear and suddenly I am some raving harpy to be handled with padded gloves?*/
@77 = ~I did say that, didn't I? Are you sure you wish to hear the tale? It is not an exciting one, and I would not wish to bore you, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI392]
@78 = ~No, I want to hear it.~
@79 = ~Maybe some other time, then.~
@80 = ~As you wish. Do not complain later, however, if you find the tale does not live up to your expectations. I am, after all, no bard. Do nothing.~ [NWARI392] /*As you wish. Do not complain later, however, if you find the tale does not live up to your expectations. I am, after all, no bard.*/
@81 = ~That would probably be best. What can I do for you, then?~ [NWARI431]
@82 = ~Where should I begin? My family lived in a human village in the wildlands of the northern mountains, and I once longed for nothing more than to be a skilled hunter, as my father was. The village was destroyed when the orcs massed and attacked the southlands. My family was killed, though I survived. For years, I thought of little but wreaking bloody vengeance upon the orcs. I stalked the crags with my bow, mercilessly killing all I crossed.~ [NWARI394] /*For years, I thought of little but wreaking bloody vengeance upon the orcs. I stalked the crags with my bow, mercilessly killing all I crossed.*/
@83 = ~That doesn't sound like you at all.~
@84 = ~How did you become a paladin after that?~
@85 = ~Okay, getting bored now...~
@86 = ~Indeed, I was much different then. My vengeance consumed me, and I dealt death at every turn... but I had no peace.~ [NWARI397]
@87 = ~It was not an easy thing. My lust for vengeance consumed me. I was no better than the beasts I hunted, to be truthful.~ [NWARI428]
@88 = ~Shush, <CHARNAME>. I have barely begun my tale. Control your attention span for a moment.~ [NWARI429]
@89 = ~On the fifth winter of my hunt, I stalked an orc tribe deep into the Spine of the World and encountered a blizzard so terrible I could do naught but camp and pray. The blizzard was merciless and lasted days, and as I lay dying in the snow and wind I spotted a human man approaching. I thought I was mad. He was tall and strong, though I noticed he was missing his right hand. The cold did not seem to affect him... and he looked down at me kindly and picked me up from the snow without effort.~ [NWARI398] /*He was tall and strong, though I noticed he was missing his right hand. The cold did not seem to affect him... and he looked down at me kindly and picked me up from the snow without effort.*/
@90 = ~I remember nothing beyond that. When I awoke, I found myself at a small Ilmateri monastery near the city of Silverymoon. The monks told me I had nearly died.~ [NWARI401]
@91 = ~Who was the man who saved you?~
@92 = ~The man who saved you... that was Tyr?~
@93 = ~You're right, this is a long story.~
@94 = ~NP: I often thought it was none other than Tyr himself, Lord of Justice. Though it may be presumptuous. Whoever he was, the monks of Ilmater didn't see him bring me... and I didn't see him again either. Or maybe it would be more correct to say that I never saw him in real life. For many months after that, he came to me in a dream and told me that my revenge did not carry true justice. At first, I rejected him, intending to return to my bloody hunt. Dreams began to dream more often, and the person was more and more harsh with me.

@95 = ~What happened then?~
@96 = ~You became a cleric, then, like Fenthick?~

@118 = ~Aye, I am angry. I have been thinking more and more of how Fenthick met his end... and how I did nothing to stop it... and I grow even more angry! Fenthick devoted his entire life to the service of justice and the performance of his duty, just as I have. And what did he get for it? Discarded.

@124 = ~Aye. Fenthick deserves plenty of my ire, as well. The stupid, stupid fool! If only he had been less trusting, less devoted, he never would have ended as he did!~ [NWARI458]

I fear I see no justice being done, here. There is no justice to be had for Fenthick, only vengeance... and I cannot do it. Perhaps it is just... the dreams. They continue to come, and get worse each night, <CHARNAME>. I hear voices crying out, so many voices...~ [NWARI439] /*All I know is that... I am tired of being sad. I am tired of feeling helpless. I feel guilty for questioning myself... but I feel I must be questioned.*/
@135 = ~The dreams have gotten worse?~
@136 = ~This is bad. Perhaps we should return to Neverwinter.~
@137 = ~I think you really may be going mad!~
@138 = ~Aye. I see Fenthick killed before me, over and over. I hear laughter, and so many crying out to me for help. I almost cannot bear it.~ [NWARI442]
@139 = ~No. No, there is nothing for me there. And doing so would only hinder your mission... and I will not do that.~ [NWARI452]
@140 = ~Perhaps I am, at that. I can think of only one thing that would soothe my thoughts.~ [NWARI452]
@141 = ~Promise me, <CHARNAME>... promise me as my dearest friend that you will find this cult and visit upon them the vengeance that I cannot!~ [NWARI443]
@142 = ~I promise.~
@143 = ~I can't promise that, Aribeth.~
@144 = ~I don't think that will help you.~
@145 = ~You are mad!~
@146 = ~Thank you, my friend. It... it is all I can think of to silence the dreams. I must do something, and to have you help me brings me great relief.~ [NWARI444]
@147 = ~I see. It is all I can think of that will silence the dreams. Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps all I need is some rest to put this into proper perspective.~ [NWARI451]
@148 = ~And I thought you were a friend. I see that no one understands what I am going through... aye, so be it. Leave me be, then, <CHARNAME>, and return to your mission. We need discuss my feelings no further.~ [NWARI454] /*Leave me be, then, <CHARNAME>, and return to your mission. We need discuss my feelings no further.*/
@149 = ~You have been a fine friend, <CHARNAME>. Here... take this. It is a ring that belonged to my father. I want you to have it. Let it symbolize our friendship. Perhaps if... something were to happen to me... it would remind you of me in days to come...~ [NWARI445] /*You have been a fine friend, <CHARNAME>. Here... take this. It is a ring that belonged to my father. I want you to have it.*/
@150 = ~What do you mean?~
@151 = ~Very well, I will take it.~
@152 = ~No, I don't want it.~
@153 = ~I don't mean anything, my friend. It is... simply fatigue and worry that make me speak such. Please... take the ring.~ [NWARI447]
@154 = ~That makes me glad. You do me a great honor by carrying it. Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.~ [NWARI448] /*Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.*/
@155 = ~Then throw it away, if our friendship means nothing to you. I hope that is not the case. Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.~ [NWARI450] /*Let us speak more later. Go, <CHARNAME>... find where the heart of this cult resides and return to me. I wish you luck with all my heart.*/
@156 = ~Your information tells us that the cult likely lies within the Host Tower in Luskan. You need to find a way to gain entrance into Luskan and into the tower, itself. Aarin should be able to help you toward that end. We will both meet you in the city, afterwards, to help you further.~ [NWARI462] /*Your information tells us that the cult likely lies within the Host Tower in Luskan. You need to find a way to gain entrance into Luskan and into the tower, itself.*/
@157 = ~I wish there were better leads we could send you on, <CHARNAME>, to track down the cult... but Aarin's information is the best we have. All I can suggest is that you visit the locales Aarin has mentioned and keep your ears open for unusual activities. Not everything that is unusual will be the doing of this cult, obviously... but they are out there, and active, so there is always a good chance you will discover them if you are alert.~ [NWARI464] /*Not everything that is unusual will be the doing of this cult, obviously... but they are out there, and active, so there is always a good chance you will discover them if you are alert.*/
@158 = ~I would suggest you speak to Aarin Gend and find out where to focus your efforts in finding evidence of the cult.~ [NWARI467]
@159 = ~It is of vital importance that you complete Lord Nasher's mission, <CHARNAME>. Much depends on you discovering what else Desther's allies have planned. Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?~ [NWARI474] /*It is of vital importance that you complete Lord Nasher's mission, <CHARNAME>. Much depends on you discovering what else Desther's allies have planned.*/
@160 = ~I'm going now.~
@161 = ~I am pleased to see that you remain safe, my friend. Lord Nasher tells me he is confident of your success, though I do worry at the danger in which you place yourself. Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?~ [NWARI475] /*I am pleased to see that you remain safe, my friend. Lord Nasher tells me he is confident of your success, though I do worry at the danger in which you place yourself.*/
@162 = ~It is good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. At times I worry that you have taken on too much responsibility yourself, yet always you surprise me with your resourcefulness and success. Have you yet discovered any new information on the cult?~ [NWARI476] /*It is good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. At times I worry that you have taken on too much responsibility yourself, yet always you surprise me with your resourcefulness and success.*/
@163 = ~NP: Sorry, I can't discuss Neverwinter business with you. Let it come to me<CHARNAME> I will only talk to him.~ /*Now you make fun of me. So be it, <CHARNAME>, I shall speak plainly.*/
