@0 = ~MT: What the<MALEFEMALE> What kind of goose is sharing a frying pan with me?~ /*Ooddle-olly, what's this <PRO_MANWOMAN>, who shares me frying pan?*/
@1 = ~Uh, I'm <CHARNAME>. Who are you?~
@2 = ~MT: My name doesn't matter, but who are you?~ /*My name isn't important.*/
@3 = ~I can't understand you. What are you talking about?~
@4 = ~MT: Who am I? My is who? I told the tree the wrong thing. I'll tell you, and you understand, my name is behind the doors. You open the door if you can, but if you don't, you fold the handles.~ /*I tell ye once and then no more, me name be locked behind a door. The door can open if ye try, but if ye lose then say goodbye.*/
@5 = ~I am going to try to ask some questions. Do you think you could answer some?~
@6 = ~You've gone insane!~
@7 = ~How about I cut out your tongue if you don't quit rhyming?~
@8 = ~I'm not going to listen to this anymore. Goodbye.~
@9 = ~MT: Oh-hoy, I'll share nonsense, if you find the answer, it's yours. But the fox is without a tail, and the task is not easy, you will lose, as if from a bush.~ /*But the fox he plays without a tail, so try as you might, I bet you fail.*/
@10 = ~I fly through the air or live in a shoe, take your time and think it through.~
@11 = ~What has driven you crazy?~
@12 = ~What exactly is it you do here?~
@13 = ~Is it possible for you to stop rhyming?~
@14 = ~What do you know about the Spirit of the Wood?~
@15 = ~It's not my plane, I say with disdain.~
@16 = ~That almost made sense. Do you mean you're crazy, because you are on the Spirit's plane?~
@17 = ~MT: There nishtyak and here nishtyak, where is my fucking cap? Bye bye, play dead!~ /*Befuddle me this, befuddle me that, now where'd ye put me blasted hat?*/
@18 = ~MT: Where is the cap, who stole it? Your work, and the conversation is over! Bye bye, play dead!~ /*Me hat be gone, who would know? Ye hid it on me, now it's time ye go!*/
@19 = ~MT: I probably drank a lot - my whole brain fell into a sediment! This is not my plan, this is such a flaw.~ /*I must be hazy, my thoughts are lazy!*/
@20 = ~When out of luck, then me get stuck. They did say hi, but no goodbye.~
@21 = ~You mean somebody left you here and you can't get out?~
@22 = ~I think you would make more sense with your head cut off. Time to die!~
@23 = ~The song me sing is in me head, better to sing than soon be dead.~
@24 = ~The job me did, though not know why, was to the tree to say goodbye. The Spirit sick, but it no die, though I did me best to try. Me chopped it good, then poisoned well, but now me be stuck here in hell.~
@25 = ~So you're the one who hurt the Spirit of the Wood. Do you know how to cure it?~
@26 = ~So you poisoned a tree and that made the Spirit sick? Why would anyone want the Spirit hurt?~
@27 = ~Too long, too long, could not hold on. Got me mind, now in a bind.~
@28 = ~I think I understand. Now I want to try to ask you some other questions.~
@29 = ~MT: As the mice galloped into the holes, they did not let me into the hole. I was assigned a strange move - to send the tree to waste. The spirit fell ill, but did not die, although I did everything I could. Chopped, poisoned, shredded from the soul, and still stuck in hell.~ /*The job me did, though not know why, was to the tree to say goodbye. The Spirit sick, but it no die, though I did me best to try. Me chopped it good, then poisoned well, but now me be stuck here in hell.*/
@30 = ~A vial with the cure does be, but you won't find it out from me.~
@31 = ~Don't worry, I won't tell anybody your secret. You can trust me.~
@32 = ~MT: There is a stone with a hidden rune that the Spirit kept as a sacred treasure. I donâ€™t know what kind of sign was there - this cobblestone was stolen by a magician! Why all this, I did not know - I did what Maugrim said.~ /*A stone to get with magic rune, that Spirit hid like a sacred tomb. Me did not see what rune be like, it goes to mage, that's quite a hike!*/
@33 = ~Who is this Maugrim?~
@34 = ~MT: There in the northeast, in a pile of stone fragments, you will find your vial.~ /*Up in the northeast, across the river Lox, is where you can find a pile of rocks. Within the pile, does lie the vial.*/
@35 = ~Why would someone want to hurt the Spirit?~
@36 = ~If the mouse squeaks, the lion pounces, and swallows down those little ounces.~
@37 = ~You are scared of this Maugrim. Don't worry, I'm a much tougher lion than he is.~
@38 = ~This Maugrim be a mage who hides in tower, be wary of his awful power. It soars up high as it can, in evil city of Luskan. Like a queen bee in her hive, others he send to keep his works alive.~
@39 = ~Do you mean there are other cultists causing trouble?~
@40 = ~The wounded duck might flop and flail, but soon be eaten, same with quail. Others come and join the feast, that's the part ye'll like the least.~
@41 = ~So you mean other cultists are causing trouble?~
@42 = ~MT: I knew three other sectarians, but what to call them, ask them. One had a passion for caves, to the north of the port flippers. The second in Luskan went to the bottom, since he hadn't run away for a long time. The last one wandered in Charwood, just like me, became mad. Now it's time for us all on board, I'll take the cap, wait - oh, hell!~ /*Of other cultists me know three, but me not know who they be. One does walk in caves like fort, north of the city of last port. Two does hide, unless he ran, within the city of Luskan. The last would be number three, lost in Charwood, mad like me.*/
