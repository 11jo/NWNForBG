@1 = ~I just want to talk.~
@2 = ~Nothing, I'm all right.~
@3 = ~Oh? What did you have in mind, m'<LADYLORD>?~
@4 = ~I'd like to know a little more about you.~
@5 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@6 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@7 = ~Do you have any advice or suggestions you can give me about my mission?~
@8 = ~Fair enough. Back to the adventure!~
@9 = ~Oh? It's a bit strange to have you ask me that, m'<LADYLORD>. Most people think they know Tomi Undergallows well enough through his reputation. In Calimport, the tales of my deeds were the daily fodder of old men in the taverns. I do not speak of heroic acts, however... I am a halfling of the underworld, if you remember.~ /*In Calimport, the tales of my deeds were the daily fodder of old men in the taverns. I do not speak of heroic acts, however...

@10 = ~What sorts of deeds are you talking about, then?~
@11 = ~I'm not much for heroism, myself.~
@12 = ~I don't think I want to hear more about it, then.~
@13 = ~Oh, nothing so sordid and evil as you might guess. I've had fame and fortune a'plenty more than once... and lost it all just as often.~
@14 = ~Then you're a <MANWOMAN> after my own heart. While there's often good reasons to do anything, the best are always gold and fame. I've done plenty, myself, in search of those two. Had both in ample quantities and lost them more than once, you know.~ /*Then you're a <MANWOMAN> after my own heart. While there's often good reasons to do anything, the best are always gold and fame.*/
@15 = ~Ha ha! Don't get me wrong, m'<LADYLORD>... I may not be the heroic type, but it's not as if I run about stealing children and kicking puppies. No, no, Tomi Undergallows may follow the scent of gold and fame wherever it leads, but I've no dastardly tales to singe the ears off the pious just yet.~ /*No, no, Tomi Undergallows may follow the scent of gold and fame wherever it leads, but I've no dastardly tales to singe the ears off the pious just yet.*/
@16 = ~My most famous exploit, in fact, is one of the reasons I chose to come to Neverwinter when I fled from Calimshan. You see, I'd spent the larger part of my years in Calimport in the employ of a powerful medusa. She was a great power in the city's underworld and that is no small feat for anyone, statue-making gaze or no.~ /*You see, I'd spent the larger part of my years in Calimport in the employ of a powerful medusa.

@17 = ~A medusa? Are you serious?~
@18 = ~But a medusa is an evil monster!~
@19 = ~Quite serious. She had a fine head for business and was as ruthless as any cold-hearted shiyk. Not as good with the face-to-face negotiations, though, if you take my meaning. I was in her employ to run... errands. Burglaries, message deliveries, walking her cat, assassinations, that sort of thing. I did my job well, too, and was well-known for it.~ /*Quite serious. She had a fine head for business and was as ruthless as any cold-hearted shiyk. Not as good with the face-to-face negotiations, though, if you take my meaning.*/
@20 = ~True. She was a spiteful one, I'll grant you that. Had a great head for business, though, and a bad hair day that could bite you back. I was in her employ to run... errands. Burglaries, message deliveries, walking her cat, assassinations, that sort of thing. I did my job well, too, and was well-known for it.~ /*I was in her employ to run... errands. Burglaries, message deliveries, walking her cat, assassinations, that sort of thing. I did my job well, too, and was well-known for it.*/
@21 = ~The job that made me famous, however, was the last one she gave me. I was to infiltrate the house of the famous vizier Sabbalan Viheyed... and kill him!~
@22 = ~You were an assassin? That's horrible!~
@23 = ~Were you successful?~
@24 = ~I don't want to hear anymore about this.~
@25 = ~If it's any consolation, m'<LADYLORD>, I doubt I killed anyone who didn't deserve it. In Calimport, you do what you can to survive. We've business to undertake, I suppose.

@30 = ~Wow, you're more impatient than a drunk cameldriver in line at the salt market, aren't you? Ask me another time and I'll tell ya everything.~
@31 = ~Hokey-dokey. Lead on, m'<LADYLORD>!~
@32 = ~Well, as I recall, you are the one who asked... so that's entirely up to you. Lead on!~
@33 = ~What's this? Oh, right. Where was I? Was I telling you about my infiltration of the house of the great vizier Sabbalan Viheyed? Yes, I believe I was. This was no ordinary mission, my friend. Sabbalan had stymied the efforts of my medusan patroness for many years... he was a mage of no little power.~ /*What's this? Oh, right. Where was I? Was I telling you about my infiltration of the house of the great vizier Sabbalan Viheyed? Yes, I believe I was.*/
@34 = ~Sending me to kill him was both a vote of confidence in my abilities and, I thought, a near-certain sentence of death. Looking me in the eyes would have been cleaner.~
@35 = ~Were you able to infiltrate his house?~
@36 = ~Why agree to the task, then?~
@37 = ~So there was considerable danger involved?~
@38 = ~I did say it was the job that made me famous, didn't I? And anyway... the threat of being turned into a short statue was rather an incentive to succeed. Perhaps it's fortunate that us halflings aren't given much credit. I was able to squirm my way into the vizier's service as a kitchen boy, and nobody gave me a second thought.~ /*Perhaps it's fortunate that us halflings aren't given much credit. I was able to squirm my way into the vizier's service as a kitchen boy, and nobody gave me a second thought.*/
@39 = ~It was not as if I were given a choice. With my patroness, you had the option of succeeding or of becoming the newest addition to her garden statuary.

I was able to squirm my way into the vizier's service as a kitchen boy, and nobody gave me a second thought.*/
@40 = ~Oh, yes, of course. To be honest it was what I lived for at the time. Tomi the Daring, they called me! The possibility of being turned into a statue if I failed did put things into perspective, to boot. Perhaps it's fortunate that us halflings aren't given much credit.

@41 = ~For over a month, I was pleased to serve the vizier his meals. I spent my time studying him, looking for a way to kill him cleanly... and he barely even noticed my presence.~
@42 = ~Why didn't you just poison his food?~
@43 = ~If he didn't notice you, wouldn't that make it easy?~
@44 = ~Didn't you feel bad about it at all?~
@45 = ~I would have, I suppose... except that he ate his meals with his daughter, and that made things a bit complicated. His daughter... ahhh, the sweet lass. Saida was her name. Human, to be sure, but she never looked down upon me. I suppose I delayed killing Sabbalan at the time just to continue being around her, though I didn't think that at the time. There was just one more excuse after another.~ /*I suppose I delayed killing Sabbalan at the time just to continue being around her, though I didn't think that at the time.

@47 = ~About the vizier? No, not really. He was a cruel man with political ambitions. His daughter, on the other hand... well, that's a different story. His daughter... ahhh, the sweet lass.

@48 = ~The months grew longer, and Saida and I grew closer. She couldn't resist my charms, of course, heh... no lass can, when I put my mind to it. We had to be secret about it... I was, of course, just the kitchen boy.~
@49 = ~Were you in love with her?~
@50 = ~But it had to be an impossible situation.~
@51 = ~You had to kill her father eventually, didn't you?~
@52 = ~Oh, I don't know about that. I thought so at the time, sure enough. My patroness kept threatening to turn me into a statue and let the pigeons have their way with me, however. I was young and foolish and stupid, however... three traits that are great in a buxom lass but poor in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my patroness to go look in the mirror. Needless to say, she didn't take it well.~ /*I was young and foolish and stupid, however... three traits that are great in a buxom lass but poor in an assassin.

@53 = ~You betrayed her. I wouldn't take it well, either.~
@54 = ~Why didn't you just kill the mage and run off with the girl?~
@55 = ~What did she do about it?~
@56 = ~Oh, aye. I couldn't let Saida find out who I was... yet my patroness was growing impatient. Wait too long and I'd be a Tomi statue with the pigeons having their way with me.

@57 = ~Oh, aye, I dreaded the thought of it, but my patroness was already threatening to turn me into a statue and let the pigeons have their way with me.

@58 = ~Well, fortunately you don't turn your closest friends into pottery. My patroness wasn't exactly the life of the party, you know. My medusa patroness decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh... if I'd known, I would have left Calimport a lot earlier.~ /*Well, fortunately you don't turn your closest friends into pottery. My patroness wasn't exactly the life of the party, you know.*/
@59 = ~I still don't see how this all made you famous.~
@60 = ~Well, don't even think about betraying me, got it?~
@61 = ~The girl wasn't going anywhere... trust me, I tried. Come to think of it, the mage wasn't all that easy to kill, either... My medusa patroness decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh... if I'd known, I would have left Calimport a lot earlier.~
@62 = ~Well, she's an evil woman with snakes for hair and a look that killed... what do you think she did about it? My medusa patroness decided to take matters into her own hands, of course.

@63 = ~It certainly didn't look that way at the time, I'll grant you that, m'<LADYLORD>. At any rate... it's a bit of a story. I'll tell you the rest some other time.

@66 = ~Both the wizard and the medusa were descending on the tower determined to kill me, and I was contentedly asleep in the hay, naked as a jaybird.~
@67 = ~Well, that can't have been good.~
@68 = ~I think I see where this is going...~
@69 = ~I don't believe a word of it.~
@70 = ~Yes, well, being naked in the hay can leave you picking straw out of your... oh, you probably mean the coming-to-kill me thing. No, no, that wasn't good.

@71 = ~So he caught you with his daughter? Did you defend her honor?~
@72 = ~You fought him then, I take it?~
@73 = ~You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. All I knew at the time was that sleeping in hay isn't as comfortable as you'd think, even with a gal on your arm.

@75 = ~Oh, no. I'd already taken her virtue, and I wasn't aware of any honor, m'<LADYLORD>. No, no, I hid behind her and screamed in terror like a banshee. Not the most heroic picture, I'll admit. I darted through his legs and fled naked into the streets. Before I knew it, the vizier was chasing me through half the city, firing off lightning bolts and curses at a rapid pace.~ /*Oh, no.

@77 = ~My patroness was also a bit miffed to see us breeze past her, and she too took up the chase. Her fury grew and grew as we stayed ahead of her.

@78 = ~What happened then?~
@79 = ~Go on.~
@80 = ~Well, my patroness was mad enough that she was determined to be the one to murder me first.

@82 = ~And this made you famous?~
@83 = ~You're making all that up!~
@84 = ~Well, sure, m'<LADYLORD>. The crowd assumed I had killed a powerful medusa and a famous wizard... bare-handed, no less. I was in no condition to argue. Word spread rapidly, of course... and the story grew. You wouldn't believe some versions I heard. Sadly, the constabulary believed them. I was a wanted man for murdering the vizier. Good for my reputation, perhaps, but bad for my health. His daughter wasn't too impressed, either.~ /*I was a wanted man for murdering the vizier.

@91 = ~Perhaps we'll find your friend, yet.~
@92 = ~Well, give it up, then. Your friend is dead, I'm sure.~
@93 = ~Oh, who cares about him? I just want those documents. Maybe he finished them before he croaked. *Sigh* I can only hope.~
@94 = ~Are these the documents you're talking about?~
@95 = ~If I find them, I'll let you know.~
@96 = ~As long as you don't let your search interfere with your service to me!~

@98 = ~Wha-aat? You're kidding, right? Let me see that! Hmmm... Hayden, Lord Friedling. 'Halfling'. Yep, that's my old monicker. And it really is Belmar's work, after all. Just my luck that it would be his crappiest work ever! I'd be laughed out of Calimport if I tried to use this! Ah, well, that's life.

@99 = ~That'd be nice of ya, m'<LADYLORD>. Until then, let's just go about your quest, aye?~
@100 = ~Fat chance of that, m'<LADYLORD>. Let's get back to your quest, then, shall we?~
@101 = ~Hmmm... come to think of it, here. Let me give ya this in return. It was a ring that the vizier wore that I, um, managed to slip off his finger before he got stoned.~
@102 = ~Thank you, Tomi.~
@103 = ~That's it? A simple ring?~
@104 = ~Yeah, well... the vizier seemed to value it. Said it had great magic in it, but it never did nothing for me. Maybe it'll bring you luck. At any rate, I don't have to worry about finding stupid Belmar anymore. I would have had to kill him for being an idiot, anyway. Let's just keep on with your quest, m'<LADYLORD>, aye?~ /*Yeah, well... the vizier seemed to value it. Said it had great magic in it, but it never did nothing for me. Maybe it'll bring you luck.*/
@105 = ~Oh, there's not much story left to tell, is there, m'<LADYLORD>? I'm just hoping we'll come across Belman's documents someday.~

@107 = ~I thought you didn't care about any of this stuff? Let's get on with your assignment. I'll take care of my own problems.~
@108 = ~Hmm. I guess I can tell you a bit about the Peninsula district, if you want... but I'm not very familiar with the rest of the city.~
@109 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula district.~
@110 = ~Then I have no questions.~
@111 = ~Well... the prison itself be the most prominent part of the district, aye? Anything interesting that goes on there is bound to be tied up with the prison, somehow. When I escaped, a bunch of the fellows being held there had taken the warden over... and the prison, too.

@112 = ~Okey-dokey. We got plenty to keep us busy, anyway, I'm sure.~

@115 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~

@118 = ~I'd like you to continue your story from before, Tomi.~
@119 = ~Well, there's only so much you can know about me, m'<LADYLORD>. Tomi Undergallows be the most famous halfling rogue in all of Calimport... that about sums it up.

Sammy and I were pals dating back to the good old days when we used to run wild through the streets as wee little urchins, stealing avacados and pinching purses. When I started to gain a bit of notoriety of my own, however, Sammy become a mite jealous. Poor lad.~ /*Well, let's see. Tomi's had a bunch of friends and a bunch of enemies in his time.

Might want to check for bunches in your panties before we're off.~ /*Gee, let me think... what might have made me offer to tell a story? Oh, I know! You asked for it! Sheesh.*/
@126 = ~Fame was always Sammy's thing. He's always loved attention, ever since he did that striptease in the half-orc bar to keep from being pummelled, I've always thought he was a bit of a diva.~
@127 = ~You seem to rather enjoy the fame, yourself.~
@128 = ~Why weren't you two a team?~
@129 = ~What did he do about it?~
@130 = ~Mmmm... naw, not so much. It's a bit hard to pick a pocket when you have twenty suspicious eyes on you. Great with the lasses, though, I'll admit.~
@131 = ~We used to be when we were tots, sure, but the plain fact is Sammy's not such a good rogue. So clumsy and wobbly, it's a shame to call him a halfling sometimes.~
@132 = ~Sammy was content for awhile, but he'd get mad when folks always recognized me first. The guards would chase me down the street and he'd complain, "Why didn't they chase ME?" Oh, he tried to show me up as a thief. Not being very good, however, it only landed him in prison. In Calimshan, that means you're as good as hung.~ /*Oh, he tried to show me up as a thief.

@133 = ~I busted him out the first time, but that only embarrassed him. No good deed goes unpunished, you know... so Sammy had to take action!~
@134 = ~You think he'd be thankful for the help.~

@136 = ~Well, the truth is I didn't really mean to break him out. It was an accident... the kind that brings down half the prison and causes a mass escape. Happens all the time, trust me. I don't know why Sammy was so mad, really. He just seemed to lose it completely... all that shouting and turning red in the face, it was just so sad. After all, he'd only broken a couple of legs... he could still walk, even if it was with a limp. Could I be held completely to blame?~ /*Well, the truth is I didn't really mean to break him out. It was an accident... the kind that brings down half the prison and causes a mass escape. Happens all the time, trust me.*/
@137 = ~At any rate, Sammy decided enough was enough. It was time to ruin his best pal, Tomi, once and for all.~
@138 = ~What did he do?~
@139 = ~You don't sound like his 'best pal'.~
@140 = ~I thought he just wanted to be famous?~
@141 = ~Sammy came up with a plan! Not the brightest plan, I suppose... he was never much of a planner. His last plan, in fact, was a heist that ended up with him being left naked and cold on a ship to Maztica. Well... all right, I did forget to go pick him up... but it was HIS plan. This plan would be different, however! Hee hee... or so he thought. I'll have to tell you about it sometime, m'<LADYLORD>.~ /*His last plan, in fact, was a heist that ended up with him being left naked and cold on a ship to Maztica. Well... all right, I did forget to go pick him up... but it was HIS plan.*/
@142 = ~Of course I was! I mean... so what if I was the one who did the job he got arrested for? So what if I slept with his lady friend while he was in prison? We were buds!~
@143 = ~And what better way to become famous than to take down the notorious Tomi Undergallows!~
@144 = ~Right-o! I was telling you about Sammy's big plan to ruin ol' Tomi, wasn't I? Ahhhh, yes. So Sammy concocts this plan to have l'il Tomi thrown in prison... just like he'd been. He was going to steal the most fabulous gem in Calimshan and I was to take the blame for it!~ /*So Sammy concocts this plan to have l'il Tomi thrown in prison... just like he'd been. He was going to steal the most fabulous gem in Calimshan and I was to take the blame for it!*/
@145 = ~If he could steal it, wouldn't that make him famous?~
@146 = ~This Sammy sounds like a dastardly halfling.~
@147 = ~How could he make you take the blame?~
@148 = ~I didn't say that Sammy was the smartest halfling on the block. In his mind, having me stuck in a Calimshite prison and ravaged daily by burly convict cell-mates was worth almost any price.~
@149 = ~Ahhhh, Sammy. Maybe he still resented my stealing both his lady friends. Hmm... actually, I stole his wife, too. Naaaah, that was years and years before. Anyway, since Sammy wasn't so skilled, he had to get some help. Ended up leveraging himself to a rather nasty elf by the name of Reegar.~ /*Ahhhh, Sammy. Maybe he still resented my stealing both his lady friends. Hmm... actually, I stole his wife, too. Naaaah, that was years and years before.*/
@150 = ~Well, with my reputation, who wouldn't believe him? For one of Sammy's plans, it was right brilliant. He was such an angry, angry little halfling.~
@151 = ~Reegar was good... he was also the meanest rogue in Calimshan, and Sammy had to practically become his servant to get him to agree. Reegar was also a pretty good pal of mine, though Sammy didn't know that. Thing was, I'd already been planning to heist that jewel myself all along. When Reegar tipped me off to Sammy's plan, I laughed so hard I just about peed in my britches.~ /*Reegar was good... he was also the meanest rogue in Calimshan, and Sammy had to practically become his servant to get him to agree. Reegar was also a pretty good pal of mine, though Sammy didn't know that.*/
@152 = ~I'm beginning to feel sorry for this Sammy fellow.~
@153 = ~So what did you do?~
@154 = ~Aye, well, he was a fellow to pity, at times. Once I remember I left Sammy in the Dark Bazaar by accident. He showed up three days later, pitch-white and devoid of hair. Ha ha! Those were the days...~
@155 = ~I did the only thing I could, of course. I made a plan of my own, and went ahead with the heist. Until the night of the heist, I didn't let on that I knew what Sammy was up to. He acted all innocent, of course... didn't say a word to me, even told me to get lost. It was quite a ruse, I tell you, but I saw through it all! He was no friend of mine, after all... he had become my arch-nemesis!~ /*Until the night of the heist, I didn't let on that I knew what Sammy was up to. He acted all innocent, of course... didn't say a word to me, even told me to get lost.*/
@156 = ~Your arch-nemesis?~
@157 = ~It sounds like you were HIS arch-nemesis.~
@158 = ~This is a very dumb story.~
@159 = ~Exactly! Like a cunning serpent, he had hidden himself as my friend! Never would I have suspected simple Sammy, the childhood pal I had de-pantsed in front of the Molikai girl's choir! Still... I'd only wanted to teach Sammy a lesson. What happened to him the night of the heist was quite tragic.~ /*Exactly! Like a cunning serpent, he had hidden himself as my friend! Never would I have suspected simple Sammy, the childhood pal I had de-pantsed in front of the Molikai girl's choir!*/
@160 = ~Oh no!~
@161 = ~Hee hee hee...~
@162 = ~I've heard enough.~
@163 = ~Wha-aat? Why would you think that? Well... there was that one time I told Rok the Crusher that Sammy stole his hammer, and not me, but Sammy forgave me after he healed, I swear! Still... I'd only wanted to teach Sammy a lesson. What happened to him the night of the heist was quite tragic.~ /*Wha-aat? Why would you think that? Well... there was that one time I told Rok the Crusher that Sammy stole his hammer, and not me, but Sammy forgave me after he healed, I swear!*/
@164 = ~Dumb? What's so dumb about it? Friendship! Betrayal! It has all the classic elements I promised! The fact that I was the victim in all this is beside the point. Still... I'd only wanted to teach Sammy a lesson. What happened to him the night of the heist was quite tragic.~ /*Dumb? What's so dumb about it? Friendship! Betrayal! It has all the classic elements I promised! The fact that I was the victim in all this is beside the point.*/
@165 = ~Aye, it's terrible. The one thing I truly regret in my life... I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let's... let's just go on with your quest. I don't want to think about Sammy any longer.~
@166 = ~Aye, laugh if you wish, m'<LADYLORD>, but it's truly awful. The one thing I regret in my life... I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let's... let's just go on with your quest. I don't want to think about Sammy any longer.~
@167 = ~Aye, it's hard to hear. Terrible. The one thing I truly regret in my life... I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let's... let's just go on with your quest. I don't want to think about Sammy any longer.~
@168 = ~Aye... the night of the jewel heist, right? *Sigh* I suppose you've been a fine friend, m'<LADYLORD>. I can tell you about it. The gem we were after was no other than the fabled 'Star of Calimshan'. It's not the most valuable ruby in the land, but certainly one of the more notorious.~ /*The gem we were after was no other than the fabled 'Star of Calimshan'. It's not the most valuable ruby in the land, but certainly one of the more notorious.*/
@169 = ~According to legend, the pashas of Calimshan gifted it to their wives on their wedding night, and the stone glows from within... filled with the tears of their lost innocence. Or so the story goes. My daring plan... and Sammy's... was to pluck this stone from the depths of the royal palace, from the very chambers of the syl-pasha's wife, herself.~ /*According to legend, the pashas of Calimshan gifted it to their wives on their wedding night, and the stone glows from within... filled with the tears of their lost innocence. Or so the story goes.*/
@170 = ~Why steal it if it wasn't valuable?~
@171 = ~What were you going to do to Sammy?~
@172 = ~Isn't that very dangerous for a young thief?~
@173 = ~The ruby's value is more in the fame one would get, m'<LADYLORD>. The syl-pasha would never rest until he captured whoever was responsible fro its theft. At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.~ /*At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.*/
@174 = ~I wasn't actually sure. I was still getting used to the idea that Sammy had turned into my arch-nemesis for no reason at all. At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.~ /*At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.*/
@175 = ~Oh, aye. What would be far worse, however, would be the syl-pasha's reaction. Taking it would be one thing... surviving long enough to enjoy it would be something else. At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.~ /*At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.*/
@176 = ~I remember being impressed at the time that things were going so well... no guards alerted, no problems whatsoever. I thought maybe Sammy's foul luck had finally turned, for once.~
@177 = ~And then?~
@178 = ~Well, of course Sammy tripped over a fold in the carpet and took a spill into a suit of armor. It fell over him into two others and the resulting clatter would have woken Nebuchadnezzar's dead brother-in-law. Poor Reegar turned white as a virgin's dainty bottom when he saw the horde of soldiers charging down the hall. He leapt out the window without first considering we were over the lion pit. Poor fella.~ /*Well, of course Sammy tripped over a fold in the carpet and took a spill into a suit of armor. It fell over him into two others and the resulting clatter would have woken Nebuchadnezzar's dead brother-in-law.*/
@179 = ~What happened to Sammy?~
@180 = ~That's horrible!~
@181 = ~The guards ran right past the pile of armor... didn't even think to look for a small halfling buried under there, lucky for Sammy. Anyway... give ol' Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.~ /*Anyway... give ol' Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.*/
@182 = ~Oh, I suppose. It's not as bad as that time we tried to rob the merchant guild and I knocked over that vat of alchemist's fire and torched all of Sammy's body hair off. Anyway... give ol' Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.~ /*Anyway... give ol' Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.*/
@183 = ~He was surprised to see me, to say the least. I decided to give him a piece of my mind, as I recall. "Why, Sammy," I said, "why did you betray me? I've never done anything to you!"~
@184 = ~Oh, he must have liked that...~
@185 = ~But that's not true!~
@186 = ~Tomi, you're a cruel halfling.~
@187 = ~I never got to hear his response. Oddly, he just turned all purple and his eyes bulged out and he spluttered a lot. Looked rather like some outraged kobold. The guards ran in just then and it was pandemonium. There was fighting and screaming and running... last I remember, I dived into the sea and woke up three days later on freighter bound for Tharsult.~ /*The guards ran in just then and it was pandemonium. There was fighting and screaming and running... last I remember, I dived into the sea and woke up three days later on freighter bound for Tharsult.*/
@188 = ~What do you mean? Oh, I admit... I made one or two mistakes in the past, but Sammy and I were pals! Not anymore, of course, now that Sammy'd turned traitor.~
@189 = ~Want to hear the funny part? For all that Sammy was a terrible thief, he was a wonderful pickpocket. Stole the ruby off me, he did, and I had nothing to show for all that.~
@190 = ~Not sure, exactly. I'd heard he'd ended up on a slave ship and somehow got sold to one of the High Captains in Luskan. Poor sod. Me, I'd like to track down that ruby one of these days. The Star of Calimshan... ahhh, it'd still be worth it, to make me famous.~ /*Not sure, exactly. I'd heard he'd ended up on a slave ship and somehow got sold to one of the High Captains in Luskan. Poor sod.*/
@191 = ~I have a ruby, here. Is this what you're looking for?~
@192 = ~Perhaps we'll find your ruby sometime.~
@193 = ~Just don't let it interfere with your obligation to me.~
@194 = ~By Brandobaris's hairy feet! It is! Where in Faerun did you find that?~
@195 = ~I found it in a wizard's tower, along the South Road.~
@196 = ~Thanks, m'<LADYLORD>! You're quite a friend, yourself! Now let's get on with your quest, shall we?~
@197 = ~Ahhh, no worries, m'<LADYLORD>! We'll find your cultists, sure enough... Sammy can wait.~
@198 = ~Huh. So Sammy did make it up hereabouts, after all. Probably slaved away in some wizard's kitchen until he slipped into a vat of ale and drowned. Ah, well. Thanks for finding it, m'<LADYLORD>... it'll take up a nice spot on my mantle. If I had a mantle, that is. Wish I had something 'side from some pocket lint to pay ya back. All I can offer you is my thanks and friendship in return.~ /*Huh. So Sammy did make it up hereabouts, after all. Probably slaved away in some wizard's kitchen until he slipped into a vat of ale and drowned. Ah, well.*/
@199 = ~Hmm... I'm not sure I want your friendship, considering what happened to Sammy...~
@200 = ~That's fine, Tomi. It's more than enough.~
@201 = ~You have a point there, m'<LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt! By the way, check out that ring I gave you once.~
@202 = ~You have a point there, m'<LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt! By the way, I've got a ring here, take it, maybe you could use it.~
@203 = ~You're a good <MANWOMAN>, m'<LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt! By the way, check out that ring I gave you once.~
@204 = ~You're a good <MANWOMAN>, m'<LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt! By the way, I've got a ring here, take it, maybe you could use it.~
@205 = ~Ha! There's not much more to it. One of these days, I'll find the Star of Calimshan. Maybe find out what happened to Sammy, too... I've decided to forgive him.~
@206 = ~You're all heart, Tomi.~
@207 = ~Ain't that the truth! It takes a special kind of man to have that much forgiveness in his heart. I think Sammy will be pleased.~
@208 = ~Nahhh, this isn't the time, m'<LADYLORD>. We have cultists to find and cut into little cultist-sized bits, don't we?~
@209 = ~Well, if I was a cult, you know where I would hide? Luskan. The City of Sails, home to every pirate, smuggler, lawyer and all-around ne'er-do-well north of Waterdeep. I mean, who would notice a few extra murders in a place like that? Last time I was there, if the pirates weren't chopping people up in the streets, the High Captains were.~ /*Well, if I was a cult, you know where I would hide? Luskan. The City of Sails, home to every pirate, smuggler, lawyer and all-around ne'er-do-well north of Waterdeep.*/
@210 = ~High Captains?~
@211 = ~That's enough information for now.~
@212 = ~Aye. There be five High Captains, ex-pirates all, who rule the city with an iron fist. Why there's five and not just one, I have no idea. Mind you, they don't really rule Luskan. Anyone who knows anything about Luskan knows that the Arcane Brotherhood really runs the show.~ /*Mind you, they don't really rule Luskan. Anyone who knows anything about Luskan knows that the Arcane Brotherhood really runs the show.*/
@213 = ~Tell me about the Arcane Brotherhood.~
@214 = ~Hokey-dokey. You go do your hero thing, then.~
@215 = ~Ahhh, it's just some group of evil wizards bent on dominating the world. You know... the usual wizard stuff. They're led by some guy called the 'Archmage Arcane', I think. If I remember right, they're all bottled up in the Host Tower, which sits just off the coast on a little island. Never come out, very secretive... that sort of thing.~ /*Ahhh, it's just some group of evil wizards bent on dominating the world. You know... the usual wizard stuff. They're led by some guy called the 'Archmage Arcane', I think.*/
@216 = ~Well, Luskan's not a very welcoming place... especially for us demi-humans. It's mostly all just really nasty human folk with no better place to be. If the cult is there, they could be anywhere, I'm guessing. Seems to me that somebody in Luskan would know something, though.~ /*Well, Luskan's not a very welcoming place... especially for us demi-humans. It's mostly all just really nasty human folk with no better place to be.*/
@217 = ~Have you always been a rogue, Tomi?~
@218 = ~I look forward to the continuation of your story.~
@219 = ~Funny you should ask that, m'<LADYLORD>. I was an urchin on the streets of Calimport, first an' foremost... and that's where I learned me street-smarts... but it wasn't always that way. In fact, when I was a tender young lad a kindly human wizard saw great promise in me and took me in. I was his apprentice, in fact, for quite some time.~ /*Funny you should ask that, m'<LADYLORD>. I was an urchin on the streets of Calimport, first an' foremost... and that's where I learned me street-smarts... but it wasn't always that way.*/
@220 = ~That's where I met my best friend Sammy, after all... he was another apprentice. I would have been a full wizard, myself, if things had worked out.~
@221 = ~What went wrong?~
@222 = ~You? A wizard? You must be joking!~
@223 = ~Well, you know... you can take the lad out of the street, but you can't take the street out of the lad. I wasn't much for books and studying and all. That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.~ /*That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.*/
@224 = ~You're making fun of me, now, aren't you, m'<LADYLORD>? Ha ha! It's true, though. When it came to books and studying, I may as well have been a Sahuagin in the desert. That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.~ /*That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.*/
@225 = ~I thought I would make a wonderful thief if I could be invisible and fly around all the time... I just couldn't wait! Halasahr had all these pretty things in his tower, unfortunately.~
@226 = ~So you stole them?~
@227 = ~I'm sure he meant the best for you.~
@228 = ~You're far too impatient, Tomi.~
@229 = ~Of course I stole them! What kind of a rogue do you think I am? Got a good price on the streets, too, even Halasahr beat me black and blue by the time I returned. Once I swiped Halasahr's spellbook and sold that for a pretty price. Boy, was the old man furious! There was a storm brewing around his tower by the time I got back!~ /*Once I swiped Halasahr's spellbook and sold that for a pretty price. Boy, was the old man furious! There was a storm brewing around his tower by the time I got back!*/
@230 = ~Well, you may think so, but ol' Halasahr was quite the taskmaster. One line mispronounced and I'd be black and blue for days! He should have been a fighter with that arm. Once I swiped Halasahr's spellbook and sold that for a pretty price. Boy, was the old man furious! There was a storm brewing around his tower by the time I got back!~ /*Well, you may think so, but ol' Halasahr was quite the taskmaster. One line mispronounced and I'd be black and blue for days!

@231 = ~Now you sound just like him. Oh! And the beatings that man would apply! He wasn't the most patient sort himself, you know. Once I swiped Halasahr's spellbook and sold that for a pretty price.

@232 = ~Of course I had to lie and say that Sammy took the book. Hmmm... come to think of it, that's how Sammy got kicked out of his apprenticeship.~
@233 = ~You got your friend kicked out?~
@234 = ~Well, he wasn't much of a wizard... and ol' Sammy wasn't my friend back then, anyway. I made it up to him by becoming his pal later, once I stopped being an apprentice. Heh... the end of my apprenticeship is quite the story, itself. I should tell you that sometime, m'<LADYLORD>, if you're interested. That would be later, though. Right now we got a city to save, right?~ /*Well, he wasn't much of a wizard... and ol' Sammy wasn't my friend back then, anyway. I made it up to him by becoming his pal later, once I stopped being an apprentice.*/
@235 = ~Was I telling a story, m'<LADYLORD>? Oh, right... about the end of my apprenticeship with Halasahr. Well, wizards are a funny lot, you know. No self-respecting thief would go poking his nose into places where it's sure to get cut off, but wizards run like moths into bonfires. Halasahr was no different. He didn't want me to find out, of course, but I had a way of sneaking around his tower without him knowing... and I saw him summoning demons.~ /*Well, wizards are a funny lot, you know. No self-respecting thief would go poking his nose into places where it's sure to get cut off, but wizards run like moths into bonfires.*/
@236 = ~Demons? So he was an evil man, then.~
@237 = ~Why would he be summoning demons?~
@238 = ~You know what a demon looks like, I take it?~
@239 = ~I don't know about evil. We are talking about Calimshan, here. I knew of two noblemen alone who had a succubus doing their housecleaning. Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.~ /*Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.*/
@240 = ~Why does any wizard summon demons? Power, knowledge, succubus booty? Who can tell? Maybe he needed a chess partner. Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.~ /*Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.*/
@241 = ~Sure. Big, red, bat wings, bad breath, infernal contract. Shoot, that was in the opening paragraph of 'the Apprentice Essentials'. I am from Calimshan, you know. Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.~ /*Sure. Big, red, bat wings, bad breath, infernal contract. Shoot, that was in the opening paragraph of 'the Apprentice Essentials'. I am from Calimshan, you know.*/
@242 = ~So after Halasahr dismissed it and left, I decided I would call up this demon and see just how much riches he could give me. It really didn't seem like such a big thing at the time.~
@243 = ~You consorted with a demon?~
@244 = ~Why would you think a demon could make you rich?~
@245 = ~No! You didn't!!~
@246 = ~Sheesh, you make it sound like we got married and ran off to the Dales to live in bliss. I only summoned it once, m'<LADYLORD>, gosh. So I read a bit of the wizard's book and summon the demon, right? Well... the demon looks all surprised to see me and he just laughs and laughs and laughs. I ask him what's so damn funny, right? He says, "Why you, little one!" He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is 'boy, I am gonna be SO rich!'~ /*I ask him what's so damn funny, right? He says, "Why you, little one!"

@247 = ~Aren't they the ones that give you three wishes? After you rub their bellies or something? I never much paid attention to my studies, you know.

He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is 'boy, I am gonna be SO rich!'*/
@248 = ~Of course I did! I mean... the bottle was just sitting there, looking all lonely. If Halesahr was a responsible wizard he would have locked it away. So I wasn't at fault for anything I did. So I read a bit of the wizard's book and summon the demon, right? Well... the demon looks all surprised to see me and he just laughs and laughs and laughs. I ask him what's so damn funny, right?

He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is 'boy, I am gonna be SO rich!'*/
@249 = ~Well, I shout at him and demand that he make me rich, right? And he laughs again. So I say he better make me powerful, then... figuring that's maybe just as good. So he laughs again! Finally he calms down and he says okay and gives me a magic wand. Says that will give me all the power I need... and 'poof!' he's gone. Boy, that wand got me into so much trouble...~ /*Well, I shout at him and demand that he make me rich, right? And he laughs again. So I say he better make me powerful, then... figuring that's maybe just as good.*/
@250 = ~Why? What did it do?~
@251 = ~Remind me not to give you any magic treasure.~
@252 = ~I just can't believe you some times...~
@253 = ~Heh... I'll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe. Let's just say Halasahr wasn't happy about it. Anyway... I'm sure we've more important things to do. Right, m'<LADYLORD>?~ /*Heh... I'll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe. Let's just say Halasahr wasn't happy about it.*/
@254 = ~Hey! I can handle my magic perfectly well! Well... usually. Well, okay, nevermind. Heh... I'll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe.

@256 = ~Ahhhh, I guess there's no harm in it. It was such a big mess, though, m'<LADYLORD>. If you'll remember, the wee demon had given me a wand, aye? So after he left, I decided that it needed to be tested out. It was exhilirating, m'<LADYLORD>... the power at my disposal! I had my apprentice chores to do, and I decided the wand should do them for me!~
@257 = ~I animated a broom to do my bidding, and it began to clean the floors! I used the wand to make a bucket that never ran short of water! I made the tables walk, the cauldrons dance, the chairs four-step... it was marvelous! I waved my wand and everything came to life!~ /*I animated a broom to do my bidding, and it began to clean the floors! I used the wand to make a bucket that never ran short of water!*/
@258 = ~So what went wrong?~
@259 = ~There's no wand that does that.~
@260 = ~What did the wizard think of this?~
@261 = ~Well... the broom was the first problem. It began cleaning more than the floors. It started sweeping the shelves, knocking Halasahr's components about, breaking things. I couldn't make it stop! In a panic, I hacked the broom apart with an axe... but then both halves became brooms! I kept hacking and hacking... and suddenly the room was filled with brooms! They were breaking everything!~ /*In a panic, I hacked the broom apart with an axe... but then both halves became brooms! I kept hacking and hacking... and suddenly the room was filled with brooms! They were breaking everything!*/
@262 = ~Oh, you think so, do you? When was the last time you summoned up a big demon who gave you a gift, huh? Happens all the time, does it?~
@263 = ~Well, he wasn't around, naturally. Considering the source of the wand, I didn't exactly want to advertise it.~
@264 = ~In my haste, I knocked over the bucket... and suddenly the tower began filling up with water! The table was attacking me... I couldn't do anything! The tower was being destroyed! Chaos! Chaos! Oh, the humanity! And then Halasahr came back...~ /*In my haste, I knocked over the bucket... and suddenly the tower began filling up with water! The table was attacking me... I couldn't do anything! The tower was being destroyed! Chaos! Chaos! Oh, the humanity!*/
@265 = ~I can't imagine he was pleased.~
@266 = ~Did he try to kill you?~
@267 = ~No... no, he wasn't pleased. He looked down at me all mad and disappointed. He was so scary I thought I'd pee my britches. He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.~ /*He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.*/
@268 = ~Well, no... he didn't try to kill me. The way he looked down at me, all disappointed and angry... I thought I'd pee my britches. He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.~ /*He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.*/
@269 = ~The bright news is, I hear Halasahr told some writer about it and the writer thought it was so amusing, he made a play! Think it will be a musical?~
@270 = ~That's horrible! Don't you feel bad at all?~
@271 = ~Well, I would have killed you.~
@272 = ~Just when I think you won't get any stranger...~
@273 = ~You know, I do feel a bit bad about the whole thing. Not for me... I knew I was no wizard. I feel bad for Halasahr. He did treat me pretty good, all things considered. He had a bunch of rare components destroyed that night. Worst of all was these ashes... the ashes of a great warrior. They were for his longevity potion. I've always thought I should try to make it up to him one day... find him those ashes, maybe. Unless he's gone and died of old age.~ /*You know, I do feel a bit bad about the whole thing. Not for me... I knew I was no wizard. I feel bad for Halasahr. He did treat me pretty good, all things considered.*/
@274 = ~I have these ashes of an Uthgardt hero... would they serve?~
@275 = ~We may come across some ashes, who knows?~
@276 = ~Keep your mind on your duty to me.~
@277 = ~I really doubt Halasahr would be happy with that...~
@278 = ~Well... now maybe they would, at that. Let me think. Aye... aye, I think that would serve for Halasahr's longevity potion just fine! Thank you, m'<LADYLORD>. Here... since you're such a friend, let me give you this. It's a powerful ring that I stole from Sammy way back. Maybe you could use it.~ /*Thank you, m'<LADYLORD>. Here... since you're such a friend, let me give you this. It's a powerful ring that I stole from Sammy way back. Maybe you could use it.*/
@279 = ~That's it? A ring?~
@280 = ~Aye, who knows? Either way, I'm happy toodling along after you, m'<LADYLORD>. Lead on!~
@281 = ~Oh, keep your knickers on, already. I said I'd come along with ya, didn't I? Sheesh. Some people's children.~
@282 = ~But you never know, do you? Heck... maybe I could even track my old friend Sammy down one day. Think he'd be happy to see me?~
@283 = ~Aye, it's not a problem, m'<LADYLORD>... least I could do. It's the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep. I'll send these ashes off to Halsahr as soon as I get the chance. Hmmm... I wonder if he'll still accept an apprentice at my age?~ /*Aye, it's not a problem, m'<LADYLORD>... least I could do. It's the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep.*/
@284 = ~You want to become a wizard now?~
@285 = ~Oh... I wouldn't look him up, if I were you.~
@286 = ~You're not going anywhere!~
@287 = ~Well... it's the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep. The rest of the stuff I got rid of long time ago. That should be worth something. I'll send these ashes off to Halsahr as soon as I get the chance. Hmmm... I wonder if he'll still accept an apprentice at my age?~ /*Well... it's the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep. The rest of the stuff I got rid of long time ago. That should be worth something.*/
@288 = ~Sure! Why not? With some magic at hand, I could be the greatest thief that Calimport has ever known! Again! Ha ha! Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!~ /*Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!*/
@289 = ~Oh, why not? You don't think he'd still hold a grudge do you? I could learn from him and become the greatest thief Calimport has ever known! Again! Ha ha! Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!~ /*Oh, why not? You don't think he'd still hold a grudge do you? I could learn from him and become the greatest thief Calimport has ever known! Again! Ha ha!*/
@290 = ~Oh, don't you worry your little head about it, m'<LADYLORD>. I'm not leaving until your quest is good and done. Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!~ /*Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!*/
@291 = ~Well... I've been thinking about it. I'd really like to find those ashes sometime... the ashes of a warrior hero. I owe it to Halasahr, don't you think? Either way, I figure I'll stick by your side so long as you're on your quest. Maybe we'll find the ashes, too. Maybe it's meant to be.~
@292 = ~Maybe later, m'<LADYLORD>. Right now we've got stuff that needs doing, don't we?~
@293 = ~Whoa... I don't know much about these areas, myself. I'm just following you, remember, m'<LADYLORD>? Although I guess I know a bit about the Coldwood...~
@294 = ~Why? What do you know about Coldwood?~
@295 = ~Well, I passed through there a few months back. Had a little gnome for a guide who talked and talked about the places we passed through. Couldn't get the little bugger to shut up, really. Anyway, he mentioned a few ruins in the woods. Really old ones, too. One of them belonged to a wizard who collected strange things... maybe she was fond of words? I don't know.~ /*Anyway, he mentioned a few ruins in the woods. Really old ones, too. One of them belonged to a wizard who collected strange things... maybe she was fond of words? I don't know.*/
@296 = ~More?~
@297 = ~There's some orcs round those parts who serve some great chieftain who calls himself a king. Obould or somethin'. Merciless and nasty fellow. I hear they've been busy attacking merchants and caravans an' the like. Maybe they're mixed up with the cult, an' maybe they know more about them magic words. Worth a shot, I suppose.~ /*I hear they've been busy attacking merchants and caravans an' the like. Maybe they're mixed up with the cult, an' maybe they know more about them magic words. Worth a shot, I suppose.*/
@298 = ~My guide said there's lots of places in the Coldwood which are really old, places where nobody goes anymore. If these Words of Power are old and lost... I don't know, maybe it's the place to look for 'em.~
@299 = ~Huh. So all this is finally gettin' close to the end, is it? You can hear that fat lady clearin' her throat already. Mind if I ask ya a question, m'<LADYLORD>?~ [NWTOMIHD]
@300 = ~What is it, Tomi?~
@301 = ~Make it quick, halfling.~
@302 = ~I don't have time for your nonsense.~
@303 = ~Well... what are your thoughts on death? You know... the permanent kind.~
@304 = ~Are you afraid of dying, Tomi?~
@305 = ~I don't intend to die.~
@306 = ~This is not the time for a philosophical discussion.~
@307 = ~It's not nonsense! It's a, umm... what do ya call it? It's a serious question.~
@308 = ~Well, that's new. Spit it out.~
@309 = ~I said forget it.~
@310 = ~I dunno. I've never given it much thought. There seems to be major potential here for me to wet my breeches over, ya know.~
@311 = ~Are you backing out on me, then?~
@312 = ~Don't worry, Tomi. You're too lucky to die.~
@313 = ~Pull yourself together, already.~
@314 = ~Well that's easy for YOU to say. I'm the sidekick, remember? The sidekicks ALWAYS die.~
@315 = ~Really? Seems like the perfect time, if ya ask me. As a matter of fact, I could sit here and talk about it alllll day...~
@316 = ~Whoa! A bit touchy, ain't we? Somebody steal your oatmeal? I bet it's just nerves... I know what ya mean. I gotta admit, though, I've been lookin' forward to this all day. Let's go teach the lizard bitch to stay dead! Woot!~ /*Whoa! A bit touchy, ain't we? Somebody steal your oatmeal? I bet it's just nerves... I know what ya mean.*/
@317 = ~Back out? Are you kidding? Miss the fight of the century? Miss all that glory and riches, the chance to be adored by halfling lasses everywhere? I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!*/
@318 = ~You know... you're right! I am too lucky to die! It's the Undergallows destiny to be rich and adored by halfling lasses throughout Faerun, after all. I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there!

@319 = ~You know just the thing to say every time, don't ya? You sweet-talker, you. Ha ha! I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there!

@320 = ~You know just the thing to say every time, don't ya? Ahhh, it's the Undergallows charm at work. You want me, it's obvious. But that's okay. I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there!

@321 = ~Ya know, you aren't so bad, yourself. You'll make a fine hero one day, if I don't miss my guess.~
@322 = ~So glad you approve.~
@323 = ~Watch it, or I kill you myself.~
@324 = ~Let's just move on...~
@325 = ~Ya know, you aren't so bad, yourself. You'll make some lad a fine wife some day, I bet.~
@326 = ~I hear ya. Now let's go teach that lizard bitch to stay dead! Woot!~
@327 = ~Eh. Not really, nah. You know what to do, don't ya?~
