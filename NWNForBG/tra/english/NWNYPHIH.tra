@0 = ~Who are you? A better question, perhaps, is what are you doing in the Tower? You don't seem like one of Maugrim's toadies.~ [NWNYPH58]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Who is this Maugrim?~
@3 = ~Stand back! I'll have no tricks out of you!~
@4 = ~NP: You don't know who I am? Well. that definitely means you don't belong to the Brotherhood. It means you're an outsider. It means you're not one of Maugrim's favorites. I would know if your Grace was among Arklem's cronies. In that case, the only question is, how did you manage to get so far into the Tower of Mysteries?~ /*So you aren't one of Maugrim's. I would know if you were one of Arklem's. The only question, then, how did you come to be this deep within the Host Tower?*/
@5 = ~I am an adventurer... exploring.~
@6 = ~I am seeking a way to destroy the cult, and its leader.~
@7 = ~I'm the one asking the questions, here!~
@8 = ~How is it that you know all this?~
@9 = ~NP: Hmmmm. you know nothing about Maugrim..... or you pretend to, but his fanatics are completely inept at it. So you're an outsider. So you're not one of Maugrim's favorites. I would know if Your Grace was among Arklem's cronies. In that case, the only question is, how did you manage to get so far into the Tower of Mysteries?~ /*So you aren't one of Maugrim's. I would know if you were one of Arklem's. The only question, then, how did you come to be this deep within the Host Tower?*/
@10 = ~NP: You certainly don't have to expect a trick from me. If I wanted to hurt you, it would have been done a long time ago, don't you think? Then you're not one of Maugrim's favorites. I would know if your Grace was among Arklem's cronies. In that case, the only question is, how did you manage to get so far into the Tower of Mysteries?~ /*So you aren't one of Maugrim's. I would know if you were one of Arklem's. The only question, then, how did you come to be this deep within the Host Tower?*/
@11 = ~NP: An evasive answer... and it's certainly far from the truth. Or do you really want me to believe that you managed to get past the Tower guards just like that? Well, I suppose it's possible that that idiot Maugrim broke the spells on the bridge... but I doubt it. On the other hand, who am I to question your word?~ /*An evasive answer... and far from the truth, no doubt. Or do you truly expect me to believe that you haplessly wandered past the Tower's wards?*/
@12 = ~NP: A noble cause. You don't look like you'd dare do such a thing. although you somehow managed to get past the guards at the bridge. Maugrim won't be easy to deal with, but I somehow doubt this news will deter you. Well, I'm certainly not going to discourage you.~ /*Maugrim will be no simple task to overcome, but somehow I doubt that will deter you. Don't let me keep you from your task, by all means.*/
@13 = ~NP: Of course. Ask away, <MALEFEMALE>.~ /*By all means. Ask away, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>.*/
@14 = ~Why are you here? Something seems very... odd.~
@15 = ~Tell me who you are.~
@16 = ~What do you know about Maugrim? Where is he?~
@17 = ~What do you know about the Tower?~
@18 = ~Forget it, I'm leaving.~
@19 = ~NP: Well, you can choose from a variety of answers. Omniscience, sacred spells, incredibly high intelligence. take your pick. I don't usually tolerate answering a question with a question, but I guess you'll do it anyway. It's okay... I, you know, have no need to be curious.~ /*Normally I would object to someone answering a question with a question, but I imagine you do that a lot. It's all right... I've no need to pry.*/
@20 = ~NP: I'd love to answer your questions, or do anything else for you... but first I'd like to ask one favor. You see that brazier in the center of the room? There's a spell that keeps me from leaving here. Would you kindly agree to destroy it?~ /*I would be more than willing to answer your questions in full or do whatever else you wish... but first, I would ask a boon of you.*/
@21 = ~How do I know you're telling the truth?~
@22 = ~It's a trick, isn't it? The brazier will explode or something.~
@23 = ~Why would I want to help you?~
@24 = ~All right, I'll do it.~
@25 = ~NP: Forget it. you're staying here.~ /*Forget it. You're staying here.*/
@26 = ~NP: Hmm. You're not missing anything, are you? Well, that's right, <MALEFEMALE>. things are not quite what they seem. The room I'm in is actually a prison. I can't leave here... though perhaps your appearance will give me a chance to escape. See that fryer in the center of the room? There's a spell that keeps me here. Would you kindly agree to destroy it?~ /*This is a prison, this room I am in. I am quite stuck... though perhaps your arrival is an opportunity for me to escape.*/
@27 = ~Technically that's not a question, it's a request. It is rather nice of you to ask, however... my name is Nyphithys. I am pleased to meet you, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>.~
@28 = ~NP: Maugrim is the new Secret Archmage of the Brotherhood, a position he took by force. Arklem, the former Archmage, took the opportunity and fled. Well, you know that, don't you? As for where Maugrim is... I have no idea where he is. I have no idea what goes on outside this room.~ /*You know this, however, do you not? As for where Maugrim is... that I have no idea of. I am unaware of anything beyond the confines of this room.*/
@29 = ~NP: You mean physically? Or do you just want to know what happened and why there are religious fanatics and dead wizards all over the place? If you want to know what's going on here now, well. I can't help you with that. I don't know anything about what's going on outside this room.~ /*If you want to know what is occurring in it now, well... that's the one thing I cannot help you with. I am aware of nothing beyond the confines of this room.*/
@30 = ~NP: You're not the nosy type, I see. That's not so bad... I usually work with mages, they're always insatiable for power and knowledge, but I can adapt to anything. Before you run away, let me ask you a favor, <male/female>. It's a very simple request, believe me. See that brazier in the center of the room? There's a spell in there that keeps me from leaving here. Would you kindly agree to destroy it?~ /*Not the curious type, I see. That's quite all right... I'm more used to working with mages and their insatiable quest for power and knowledge, but I can adapt.*/
@31 = ~NP: Do you think I'd stay in this room for any other reason in my right mind? Or are you just trying to throw me off somehow? I suppose there's nothing I can say to back that up. But you can ask me anything, of course.~ /*Do you believe I would stand here in this room for some other reason? Waiting for the odd chance that you might stumble upon me, perhaps?*/
@32 = ~Why don't you destroy the brazier yourself?~
@33 = ~Why were you imprisoned and not killed?~
@34 = ~Who are you? A wizard of the Brotherhood?~
@35 = ~Prove you're not a cult follower. Tell me of their defenses.~
@36 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@37 = ~NP: Hmm. I think it's just an ordinary brazier that Maugrim put his spell on. You can take a closer look at it yourself. If it explodes, it would be extremely inconvenient for me, because I would be at the scene of the explosion, just like you.~ /*Hmmm. I don't believe it is anything other than a regular brazier that Maugrim anchored his spell to. You are free to investigate it for yourself, however.*/
@38 = ~Oh? Are you saying you would prefer to see me left here, trapped? I have a magic item, here, to offer as reward, if need be.~
@39 = ~I want something now, in advance.~
@40 = ~That does sound good...~
@41 = ~No, that's not enough.~
@42 = ~I'm not talking about a reward.~
@43 = ~That is a relief. Please proceed... I am eager to be away from this cramped little room.~
@44 = ~I see. I do not appreciate being disregarded so, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. Are you sure you will not change your mind?~
@45 = ~Not unless you make me a better offer.~
@46 = ~I am sure.~
@47 = ~I might change my mind.~
@48 = ~NP: I'd do it with great pleasure. if I could reach it. Unfortunately, the spell keeps me away from the brazier. It would be too foolish for Maugrim to set up my prison any other way, don't you think?~ /*I would be perfectly capable of doing so, I assure you... if I could reach it. Unfortunately the spell that restricts my movement falls just short of the brazier.*/
@49 = ~That is... difficult to explain. Killing me would not serve Maugrim's purposes.~
@50 = ~What do you mean?~
@51 = ~A wizard? Me? No... not quite. I am Nyphithys... advisor and assistant to Archmage Arklem, the deposed leader of the Brotherhood.~
@52 = ~Why would Arklem have a non-wizard as an advisor?~
@53 = ~Are you telling me everything?~
@54 = ~So you are evil like the rest of the Brotherhood.~
@55 = ~Why didn't you flee with Arklem, then?~
@56 = ~NP: Defenses? Well, I doubt Maugrim would have had time to put the tower's defenses back in place. If you have the right rune stones, you should be able to move through the halls quite freely. I suspect Maugrim himself will take over Arklem's office. That would be quite in the spirit of the idiot. Look for Valinda Shadowmantle, she may have a rune stone that will help you get to Arklem's study.~ /*Their defenses? Well, I doubt Maugrim has had time to set most of the Tower's wards back up. With the right runestones, I suspect you could move throughout the halls at will.*/
@57 = ~Then what shall it be? Will you destroy the brazier or not? It is a simple enough act.~
@58 = ~NP: And you'll just walk out the door and I'll have nothing to offer if someone shows up here again and can help me? Oh, no. I have a lot more to offer you more than you think, I suppose, if you'd just help me get out of this prison. Well, what do you say?~ /*I can offer you plenty... more than you suspect, I imagine... if you simply help me to free myself from this prison. What do you say?*/
@59 = ~I can offer you plenty... more than you suspect, I imagine... if you simply help me to free myself from this prison. What do you say?~
@60 = ~NP: Greed, huh? Well. there's a lot of things here in the Tower that you'd no doubt like to have, and there's probably no one guarding them right now. I can offer you a lot more. more than you think, I suppose... if you'll just help me get out of this prison. Well, what do you say?~ /*So it's greed, is it? Well... there's all kinds of things you would no doubt like to have right here in the Tower, with no one particularly guarding them.*/
@61 = ~NP: And what's troubling you? What will I do when you set me free? Do I represent good or evil? Honestly, when you release me, I'm going to find Arklem. I doubt you and I will meet again.~ /*So your concern would be what? What I intend to do after you free me? Whether I am a good person or not?*/
@62 = ~That is too bad. I would have enjoyed freedom. As it is, I shall have to be satisfied with a little carnage.~
@63 = ~Then what keeps you from aiding me? Will you destroy the brazier or not? It is a simple enough act.~
@64 = ~Changed my mind again... ha ha!~
@65 = ~I mean that while it would be inconvenient to me, it would not prevent me from searching for Arklem... which Maugrim hopes to prevent.~
@66 = ~Meaning you are not human at all, then.~
@67 = ~Meaning you would be sent back to your home plane? Inconvenient but not permanent.~
@68 = ~I don't understand...~
@69 = ~(sigh) Because I bring him certain advantages, things his wizards could not provide for him.~
@70 = ~His human wizards, you mean.~
@71 = ~Such as?~
@72 = ~About myself? No, not at all. As a matter of fact, I am beginning to grow weary of your questioning. Be quick about it.~
@73 = ~Then you'll get no help from me.~
@74 = ~Evil is a subjective term, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. Unless you mean it in a more primordial sense... in which case, yes, I am evil. Does that disturb you?~
@75 = ~Primordial evil...? Such as a demon?~
@76 = ~Of course it disturbs me!~
@77 = ~No, not really.~
@78 = ~It was I who told Arklem to flee. I am not about to lose an investment of so many years to some fool and his overambitious cult.~
@79 = ~You don't sound like an advisor...~
@80 = ~Now... is that enough? I could tell you more once you free me, I assure you.~
@81 = ~You are amusing yourself, I see. Perhaps I failed to mention that while I couldn't leave this room... it certainly doesn't prevent me from killing you!~
@82 = ~NP: You're not stupid, <MALEFEMALE> <RACE>, that's for sure. But I'm not going to fill in the gaps in your knowledge. You only know what you know. It doesn't make any difference. I'm tired of your questions... now tell me: are you going to destroy the roaster, or not?~ /*A clever <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MALEFEMALE> you are, indeed. I shall not fill in the blanks, however. You know what you know.*/
@83 = ~Very well... I'll destroy it.~
@84 = ~No.~
@85 = ~I've had enough... you die now!~
@86 = ~NP: You ask too many questions, <MALEFEMALE>. I'm not going to fill in all the gaps in your knowledge. You only know what you know. There's no difference. I'm tired of your questions... now tell me: are you going to destroy the roaster or not?~ /*It makes no difference, however. I'll have no more questions from you... tell me now: will you destroy the brazier or not?*/
@87 = ~Then why the questions? I am no psychotic killer. I said I would reward you for freeing me and I shall.~
@88 = ~And if I am not? If I was the influence behind Arklem's rule, what difference would that make to you? I tire of your questions, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>.~
@89 = ~Mmmm... a rather delicious looking <PRO_RACE> creature, is it? What a treat. Please don't tell me you're one of the fools toadying after Maugrim.~ [NWNYPH56]
@90 = ~What is the delay? Surely you cannot tell me you are having difficulty destroying the brazier.~ [NWNYPH55]
@91 = ~I'm not sure I should, actually.~
@92 = ~Forget it... I'm not going to help you.~
@93 = ~I'll do it.~
@94 = ~And why is that? I am asking you to do nothing strenuous. Will you do it or not?~
@95 = ~NP: Then do it. I'm tired of waiting.~ /*Then do so. I tire of waiting.*/
@96 = ~I will not be questioned any further, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>. I am sure you know more than enough... now destroy the brazier before I grow impatient.~ [NWNYPH54]
@97 = ~NP: Nice work. Maugrim will be furious when he finds out that some adventurer freed me from his spell. I can't wait to go after Arklem. It's hard to imagine where he might be hiding in his... condition. Still, we'll get the Tower back in time.~ [NWNYPH50] /*I am eager to be off in search of Arklem. It will be difficult to say where he might have hidden himself in his... condition. Regardless, the Tower will be ours again in time.*/
@98 = ~NP: As for you, <MALEFEMALE>... your work is done. You've had your chance to free me, and the reward is rightfully yours. Take this and go. I hope you won't be in the Master's Tower when I return.~ /*As for you, <PRO_MALEFEMALE>... you did your part. You freed me, and the reward is yours by right. Take this item and go.*/
