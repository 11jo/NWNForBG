@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~Bye bye.~
@4 = ~As you wish. As long as this grove stands I will try to maintain the balance by offering my services to any who ask.~
@5 = ~NP: I'm afraid I can't tell you much. For many days and nights I have not left this grove, and I know nothing about this war in the city. Previously, all my efforts were aimed at preserving the natural harmony in this city, but the war brought chaos and destruction with it. Now I am doing my best to preserve this grove and make it a quiet refuge for anyone who may need it.~ /*I have worked long to preserve nature's balance in this city, but in the chaos and destruction of war all my efforts are focused on preserving this grove as a place of tranquility and refuge for those who need it.*/
@6 = ~May the Earthmother and Treefather give you the strength to maintain balance in these troubled times.~
