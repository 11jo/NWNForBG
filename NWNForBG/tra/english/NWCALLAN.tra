@0 = ~Need a drink? Times is tough, and a body could use a little lubrication to keep it movin'.~
@1 = ~I wish I had clear answers about the zombies in this district.~
@2 = ~NP: I need a drink. What can you offer?~ /*I require temple services. What can you offer?*/
@3 = ~NP: I want to rest. Do you have spare rooms?~ /*I'll take a look at your normal items.*/
@4 = ~I'll manage without it, thanks. Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I don't blame you. Been crazy around these parts. First the plague, then this. We'll all be walking the Warrens before we're through.~
@6 = ~Where are the undead coming from?~
@7 = ~What are the "Warrens?"~
@8 = ~Is anyone fighting back against the undead?~
@9 = ~I'd better get to it. Goodbye.~
@10 = ~NP: Certainly,<SIRMAAM> .~ /*"Of course, <CHARNAME>."*/
@11 = ~Keep safe. The more warm bodies we have, the better.~
@12 = ~NP: Dead people. To be honest, they dont come from a specific location. People who die of pestilence stand again right where death finds them. There is also one near the Great Cemetery in the north. I mean, go figure it out, this place is full of dead people.~ /*The dying. Seriously, they don't seem concentrated anywhere, and people that die of plague seem to rise from where they fall.*/
@13 = ~NP: Sorry. This is a local belief. &quot;Labyrinths of the Damned, leading deep from under the graves to the very doors of Hell.&quot; Its about the crypts under the Great Cemetery. People imagine terrible things because they dont see them. Trivia.~ /*Sorry. Local superstition. "The Warrens of the Damned, burrowing deep beneath the dead to the very doormat of the Hells."*/
@14 = ~NP: Harben Ashensmith is here, and the famous undead hunter, Drake. He won my who can eat the most pickled eggs contest two years in a row. He will deny it, wont even let you ask, but you just think about it when he gets too serious. And Desters Helmites are also somewhere in this area. It seems that they founded a sanctuary here.~ /*Harben Ashensmith is here, and the celebrated undead hunter, Drake. He won my "Eat the Most Pickled Eggs" jamboree, two years running.*/
@15 = ~I am here to serve, though I can't offer much. The greatest tragedy is the interruption of my beer supply.~
@16 = ~They say there's cause for celebration, that the undead are back to their dirt-naps, so to speak. Good on you if you saved the day.~
@17 = ~NP: Farewell.~ /*Farewell*/
@18 = ~NP: Come back whenever you want.~ /*Come to my assistance, if you may.*/
