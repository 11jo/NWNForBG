@0 = ~I heard the Blacklake nobles have a cure for the plague, but they won't share it with us common folk! I hear a lot of things, though.~
@1 = ~I heard the Blacklake nobles were hoarding stuff, but someone went in there and did something about it. Mostly rumor, though.~
@2 = ~I heard the Beggar's Nest is crawling with zombies infected by the plague!~
@3 = ~At least the zombies in the Beggar's Nest have been dealt with. Of course, their corpses probably still carry plague...~
@4 = ~Quit waving your weapon around like a thug! Criminals aren't running things around here; this isn't the Docks district!~
@5 = ~Heard about the prison break in the Peninsula district? As if the plague wasn't bad enough!~
@6 = ~I heard the prison break in the Peninsula district was put down violently. I hope the bodies don't get burned here. There's too many now.~
@7 = ~You must be one of the new city guard. Hopefully you can do something about those zombies in the Beggar's Nest.~
@8 = ~You one of the new city guard? I heard someone new took care of the zombies in the Beggar's Nest. Good job, whoever it was.~
@9 = ~You aren't with those pirates in the Docks, are you? I thought they were only around the Nelanther Isles. Guess I don't know much.~
@10 = ~People like you belong in the Docks district - along with the rest of the thugs and ruffians!~
@11 = ~Sorry cleric, but I can't even begin to think the gods are good while the stink of burning corpses covers everything.~
@12 = ~The militia can't keep order anymore! The guards in the Core don't even care that there was a prison break in the Penisula district.~
@13 = ~Think carrying that weapon will keep the Wailing Death at bay? May as well spit in the Anauroch!~
@14 = ~There's anarchy in the Docks district! I heard criminals have taken over and the city guard are afraid to go in there now.~
@15 = ~I heard the Docks district is quieter now. Maybe I should go there. I really need to get away from the smell of burning flesh.~
@16 = ~Hmph. Keep your magic to yourself around here, <SIRMAAM>. Some blame sorcery for the plague! They might banish mages to the Mere of Dead Men. Maybe.~
