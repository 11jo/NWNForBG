@0 = ~NP:  I don't like it. I don't like it at all. When I wanted to be an archaeologist, I imagined it very differently! Master Ford is messing around with things he doesn't understand. Things like the Source Stone are better left to wizards, not professors and their students!~ /*Master Ford is messing with things he doesn't understand. Things like that Source Stone are best left to wizards, not professors and their students!*/
@1 = ~I need to see the Source Stone.~
@2 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~You'll have to see Master Ford about that. I don't know why anyone would want to see that thing, though. There's something evil about that stone - I can feel it!~
@5 = ~Go ahead and ask your questions. I'll tell you whatever I know.~
@6 = ~Who are you?~
@7 = ~Who is Master Ford and where can I find him?~
@8 = ~What do you know about the Source Stone?~
@9 = ~Where are the Words of Power?~
@10 = ~You should go speak to Master Ford. Maybe you can talk some sense into him and get him to give this all up.~
@11 = ~NP: I am Esmeralda, one of Master Ford's apprentices. He made me prepare a potion of crushed gemstones as if it would help him unlock the secret of the Source Stone. But this stone is not like ordinary gemstones. We have no idea what we're messing with, and I don't like that at all.~ /*I am Esmerelda, one of Master Ford's students. He has me concocting philters of crushed gems, as if he hopes that will give him some insight into the Source Stone.*/
@12 = ~NP: Master Ford is only the most famous archaeologist in all of Neverwinter! He has spent nearly fifty years searching for various items of great historical value! But he's never found anything like this before. I am honored that he chose me to help him uncover the secrets of the Supreme Rock! That's him there, at the passage to the Source Stone.~ /*But he's never unearthed anything like this before. I'm honored he chose me to help him uncover the secrets of the Source Stone! That's him, over there by the door.*/
@13 = ~NP: This stone contains incredible power. It also radiates a strong but gentle heat throughout the city. That's why there is never a winter in Neverwinter. Beyond that, we *know* very little. But Master Ford has some interesting theories. You should talk to him about them in person.~ /*The stone contains immense power and radiates a widespread but gentle warmth throughout the whole city. That's the reason it's never winter in Neverwinter.*/
@14 = ~They're with the Source Stone, of course. Master Ford feels their power is the key to unlocking the secrets within. Perhaps you should speak to him about this.~
