@0 = ~Greetings of the Even-Handed to you. Welcome to the House of Tyr. I am Reverend Judge Oleff Uskar, in service of the Maimed God.~ [NWOLE052]
@1 = ~Hello Oleff. I am <CHARNAME>. Will you answer some questions?~
@2 = ~Hello Oleff. Will you answer some questions?~
@3 = ~Enough chatter. I have questions for you.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~This Tyrran home welcomes your well-mannered address. Ask what you will, and I shall respond as I am able.~
@6 = ~I think I've found a Tyrran artifact. Does it interest you?~
@7 = ~I have a letter from Ophala for you.~
@8 = ~What is your position here?~
@9 = ~What are the tenets of the Tyrran faith?~
@10 = ~I require temple services. What can you offer?~
@11 = ~The tenets of the faith are for the ears of the faithful. I will not parade them out so you can mock them with your brutish manner.~
@12 = ~I am bound by Tyr to serve as long as the cause is just, but mind your tone. Disrespect is not tolerated in this place.~
@13 = ~Tyr guide to you justice.~
@14 = ~By the Even Handed! If you have found an artifact of the Tyrran faith, I must draft you to our cause immediately! Take this letter to show you are in my service. I've Briley guarding a tomb in the East of the Peninsula, but I didn't expect this. We have been searching for the resting places of Neverwinter founder Halueth Never and his companions. We hoped such a discovery would buoy the spirits of our people in this dark time. I will offer a reward, of course.~ /*By the Even Handed! If you have found an artifact of the Tyrran faith, I must draft you to our cause immediately! Take this letter to show you are in my service. I've Briley guarding a tomb in the East of the Peninsula, but I didn't expect this.*/
@15 = ~Describe the recovery of Jacob's blessed quill from the evil Gilles.~
@16 = ~I'm sorry, it was a joke.~
@17 = ~What? Let me see that. Oh, yes, of course. Please, just keep your voice down, and I'll get you what you need.~
@18 = ~We administer to the plague sufferers. Previously we were working on artifact recovery, which may be even more important now.~
@19 = ~There are many aspects to the worship of Tyr. He is the Blind Overlord, the Even-Handed. He is the guardian and governor of justice. The clergy are charged to reveal the truth, punish the guilty, right the wrong, and to always be true and just in their actions. We serve as judges, juries and, should the situation require it, executioners. Justice through benevolent force and armed vigilance.~ /*We serve as judges, juries and, should the situation require it, executioners. Justice through benevolent force and armed vigilance.*/
@20 = ~That might sound harsh to some people.~
@21 = ~Temple services are available from Aribeth. She has stepped in to assist us because... well, we have suffered our own losses to the plague.~
@22 = ~What?! He looted our fallen even as they gasped their last? I cannot imagine a more despicable act! Such disregard! This item is not really an artifact, but I consider it valuable nonetheless. You are truly a friend of Tyr, risking yourself as you have. Take 500 gold as reward. It is the least we can do. Your efforts are appreciated. A light has been cast on Halueth Never and his life, but there is still more to find.~ /*This item is not really an artifact, but I consider it valuable nonetheless. You are truly a friend of Tyr, risking yourself as you have. Take 500 gold as reward. It is the least we can do.*/
@23 = ~Do not taunt us. The followers of Tyr do not brook such mischief at the best of times.~
@24 = ~Oh dear... you seem to have contracted some form of sickness. You are lucky that it doesn't appear to be the plague, but I cannot certify you as disease-free until you rid yourself of it. I would you suggest you go at once to Aribeth. She will be able to cure this affliction.~ /*Oh dear... you seem to have contracted some form of sickness. You are lucky that it doesn't appear to be the plague, but I cannot certify you as disease-free until you rid yourself of it.*/
@25 = ~Let's see... hmmm... yes, I do believe you are plague free. Here is the document you need. Ophala should have no objection to your... patronage.~
@26 = ~Why do you consort with a sinful operation?~
@27 = ~You might understand the significance of it, being a cleric yourself. Am I wrong? I can usually spot devout inclinations.~
@28 = ~Certainly you will understand the importance of it. You walk with the gait of a paladin; we need that kind of dedication.~
@29 = ~You are a monk, are you not? I do not know your precise spiritual bent, but you may understand the importance of what I require.~
@30 = ~It is really a matter that would only concern someone more spiritually minded, and I don't think you are the type. No offense meant.~
@31 = ~I might still be able to help.~
@32 = ~The law is unyielding, but true justice is also merciful when circumstances dictate. That can be hard to remember in times of crisis.~
@33 = ~There are further artifacts of his travels. In the weeks before the plague, we uncovered the tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade. She traveled widely with Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter! This was a great discovery, and gave clues to the whereabouts of the founder's resting place. That would have been a great discovery indeed! The plague undoubtedly complicated things. It is very unfortunate, because pursuing these tombs becomes all the more important with the city in crisis, as it is.~
@34 = ~People are scared, and the lack of progress on a cure has diminished their hopes. A find like this would buoy their spirits. There is also a chance that powerful artifacts could be found alongside Halueth Never's remains, though I would not rest my hopes upon it.~ /*There is also a chance that powerful artifacts could be found alongside Halueth Never's remains, though I would not rest my hopes upon it.*/
@35 = ~I will help you find these tombs.~
@36 = ~I have no interest in helping.~
@37 = ~I welcome your aid in this matter. You couldn't have arrived at a more fortuitous time. Here, take this letter with my seal. It signifies that you act with my sanction. Take it to Briley in the Peninsula district and he will aid you. He guards the one tomb already found. It is in the basement of a house in the east side of the Peninsula district. Return to me if you find anything and I will reward you.~ /*It signifies that you act with my sanction. Take it to Briley in the Peninsula district and he will aid you. He guards the one tomb already found.*/

@39 = ~That is unfortunate, and I understand how you might be reluctant. If you change your mind, just speak to me again.~
@40 = ~What? But... look, Ophala has friends in very high places. The Moonstone Mask would operate without my help. I just provide a service.~
@41 = ~Gold. I want gold to keep quiet about you.~
@42 = ~Is that all? Just gold? Listen, you! If I pay, I will never acknowledge this complaint again! Is that understood!? I knew this would bite me in the ass one day. Very well. Here. 500 gold. Never speak of it again! I know I won't!~ /*Is that all? Just gold? Listen, you! If I pay, I will never acknowledge this complaint again! Is that understood!?*/
@43 = ~In the weeks before the plague, we uncovered the tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade. She traveled widely with Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter! This was a great discovery, and gave clues to the whereabouts of the founder's resting place. That would have been a great discovery indeed.~ /*In the weeks before the plague, we uncovered the tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade. She traveled widely with Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter!*/
@44 = ~The plague undoubtedly complicated things.~
@45 = ~Your efforts were likely wasted when the plague hit.~
@46 = ~A waste of time, even before the plague hit.~
@47 = ~Perhaps I was too quick to judge. You seem sincere enough. You may be able to understand why this is so important.~
@48 = ~No, while I appreciate your offer, this would best be left to someone more inclined to understand the needs of the church.~
@49 = ~Yes, it did. It is very unfortunate, because pursuing these tombs becomes all the more important with the city in crisis, as it is.~
@50 = ~Contrary to your ignorant opinion, there are very valid reasons to pursue these tombs, especially now that the plague has ravaged the city.~
@51 = ~What do you know about Halueth Never?~
@52 = ~He was the founder of Neverwinter. Actually, not much is known about him, really. He's become a bit of a legendary figure. He reportedly fortified a fledgling Neverwinter against the Illusk barbarians, deflecting their wrath to Luskan and setting the tone for our uneasy relations with that city. Knowing the details of his life could be very beneficial to the city. The people need to know they have a history of defeating adversity.~ /*He reportedly fortified a fledgling Neverwinter against the Illusk barbarians, deflecting their wrath to Luskan and setting the tone for our uneasy relations with that city.*/
@53 = ~Greetings to you again, <CHARNAME>. It is good to see you return to this house of Tyr.~ [NWOLE053]

@55 = ~I hope there has been some progress with the search for Halueth Never's tomb. It would raise the spirits of the city.~
@56 = ~I have an artifact from one of the tombs.~
@57 = ~Go over what is needed again.~
@58 = ~I need temple services.~
@59 = ~I must apologize, however, if my mood seems somber. I have received word that... that the followers of Talona have laid claim to the artifacts in the tombs we were searching. There are no more artifacts for you to find... they have been delivered into the hands of evil. I cannot fathom what has made this possible. Needless to say, you are no longer needed for this task. I am sorry...~ /*I must apologize, however, if my mood seems somber. I have received word that... that the followers of Talona have laid claim to the artifacts in the tombs we were searching.*/
@60 = ~You do? Wonderful. Please, tell me what it is that you have found.~
@61 = ~Describe the recovery of the Ancient Chronicles of Never.~
@62 = ~Describe the recovery of Halueth Never's rusted armor.~
@63 = ~Describe the recovery of the ancient Holy Symbol of Tyr.~
@64 = ~Describe the recovery of Jacob's blessed quill from the evil Gilles.~
@65 = ~In the weeks before the plague, we uncovered the tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade. She traveled widely with Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter! This was a great discovery, and gave clues to the whereabouts of the founder's resting place. That would have been a great discovery indeed. Yes, it did. It is very unfortunate, because pursuing these tombs becomes all the more important with the city in crisis, as it is.~ /*In the weeks before the plague, we uncovered the tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade. She traveled widely with Halueth Never, founder of Neverwinter!*/
@66 = ~An excellent find! Neverwinter will benefit from learning about its auspicious origins. Perhaps we can find historical precedent for the plague as well.~
@67 = ~His very armor! And the location of his tomb! Who would have thought it was just beneath the surface, amidst so many others? It speaks of his desire to be known as just another Neverwintan. Despite his greatness, he never forgot his home.~ /*It speaks of his desire to be known as just another Neverwintan. Despite his greatness, he never forgot his home.*/
@68 = ~We have not seen the like of these in many many years. It brings new light to the wisdom of Halueth Never and his companions.~
@69 = ~What?! He looted our fallen even as they gasped their last? I cannot imagine a more despicable act! Such disregard! This item is not really an artifact, but I consider it valuable nonetheless. You are truly a friend of Tyr, risking yourself as you have. Take 500 gold as reward. It is the least we can do.~ /*This item is not really an artifact, but I consider it valuable nonetheless. You are truly a friend of Tyr, risking yourself as you have. Take 500 gold as reward. It is the least we can do.*/
@70 = ~As I said, you are to be rewarded. Here, take this 200 gold. It's not much, but there is more to come. Well, I had hoped to give more, but disturbing news has reached me. There were others searching for the tombs as well and... some of what we sought now rests in evil hands. I don't understand how this could have happened, but representatives of Talona have begin taunting us in a most unfriendly fashion... flaunting their theft in our faces.~ /*Well, I had hoped to give more, but disturbing news has reached me. There were others searching for the tombs as well and... some of what we sought now rests in evil hands.*/
@71 = ~You have retrieved more than what we could have hoped for. A grand triad of artifacts, more than worthy of Never's legacy. We will guard well these items and the tombs they were found in. Take this amulet, and go with the blessing of Tyr.~ /*We will guard well these items and the tombs they were found in. Take this amulet, and go with the blessing of Tyr.*/

@73 = ~Your efforts are appreciated. A light has been cast on Halueth Never and his life, but there is still more to find. There are further artifacts of his travels. Return to me if you find them. I shall reward you fairly, plus more when they are all recovered.~ /*There are further artifacts of his travels. Return to me if you find them. I shall reward you fairly, plus more when they are all recovered.*/
@74 = ~You'll understand if I forgo further reward, won't you? We will need our resources to try and puzzle out what happened in this search.~

@76 = ~You have done much, and have even found the final resting place of Halueth Never, but what we have so far suggests there is more. There are further artifacts of his travels. Return to me if you find them. I shall reward you fairly, plus more when they are all recovered.~ /*There are further artifacts of his travels. Return to me if you find them. I shall reward you fairly, plus more when they are all recovered.*/
@77 = ~Greetings. Are you with <CHARNAME>? I am curious as to how the search for Halueth Never's tomb is going.~ [NWOLE054]
@78 = ~I am thoroughly disgusted by the nature of people, and refuse to assist you. You may blame the actions of a small number for my mood. It is despicable... imagine, our holy relics that we sought... in the hands of evil! We were searching for the ancient tombs... but now there is little point.~ [NWOLE051] /*It is despicable... imagine, our holy relics that we sought... in the hands of evil! We were searching for the ancient tombs... but now there is little point.*/
@79 = ~Forgive me. You are still investigating the plague, and I must be thankful for that.~
@80 = ~I welcome the return of this item, but it is a shining spot in an otherwise bleak day. It does little to improve my true mood. Here. Take some gold. It would seem that the treasure is all some people care about.~ /*I welcome the return of this item, but it is a shining spot in an otherwise bleak day. It does little to improve my true mood.*/
@81 = ~The plague snaps at the heart of Neverwinter, but we have a history. We shall fight with the newly detailed fury of Halueth Never. Thank you for your assistance, . You were invaluable.~ [NWOLE050] /*The plague snaps at the heart of Neverwinter, but we have a history. We shall fight with the newly detailed fury of Halueth Never.*/
@82 = ~That beast looted our fallen even as they breathed their last? Despicable! You have done a great service by bringing him to task! You are a great friend of Tyr, and will be remembered as such. Here, an additional 500 gold. It is the least we can do. Unfortunately, it is very near the most we can do as well. Still, I hope it is sufficient. Thank you, <CHARNAME>. Thank you.~ /*That beast looted our fallen even as they breathed their last? Despicable! You have done a great service by bringing him to task!*/
