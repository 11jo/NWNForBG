@0 = ~Ye may not be of me own clan, but yer a dwarf right enough - I figure ye must be all right. My name is Hodd, leader of me clan.~ [HODD055]
@1 = ~Is there somethin' I can help ye with?~
@2 = ~Why are the dryads at war with you?~
@3 = ~What do you make of this amulet?~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~NP: All right, dwarf. It's your turn to die.~ /*All right dwarf. Now it's your turn to die.*/
@6 = ~I think I will go now. Farewell.~
@7 = ~NP: You can't stop these leaf blowers! They're crazy, I'm telling you! Attacking as soon as they see me and my boys with their magic! Well, somewhere in my heart I don't think we should blame the dryads alone. I don't tell my boys this, but sometimes things get, uh. weird. It's like a dream or a nightmare.~ /*And yet in me heart I wonder if the dryads are the only ones to blame. I don't speak of it with me kin but sometimes things are... strange. Like I be havin' a dream... or a nightmare.*/
@8 = ~NP: Yeah, it's a nice little thing. And it looks, uh. familiar. Like I've seen it before. You see the inscription on the back there? It's an ancient language. although I think I can make out the words: "The wood and the forge have joined together to bring down the Overlord."~ /*Ye see the fancy writin' on the back? An old and ancient tongue... yet I can figure out the words: "Tree and forge united, to overthrow the Master."*/
@9 = ~So be it. The wisdom of me and my clan is yours for the takin', though I don't know much beyond this endless war with them damn immortal tree huggers!~
@10 = ~Immortal? What are you talking about?~
@11 = ~What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?~
@12 = ~Then ye'll taste me battle hammer before ye finish me off!~
@13 = ~Aye, and good luck to ye. Mind yerself as ye never know where the dryads might be lurkin'!~
@14 = ~In me visions I see dryads slain and their trees chopped down by me own kin's axes. Aye, 'tis enough to make me wonder if we dwarves have ever fallen under the same strange madness as the tree huggers.~
@15 = ~Have you always been at war with the dryads?~
@16 = ~This amulet was forged to hold great magic, but ye see how it be cracked now? Whatever magic it once had is long gone.~
@17 = ~Can you do anything to fix it?~
@18 = ~The amulet be repaired, right enough, and finely forged. But there be no magic in it save the magic of a great craftsman. Its original powers be no more.~
@19 = ~Can you make it magic?~
@20 = ~The amulet brings strange thoughts into me head. It... it stirs up dreams of ages past. Aye, I can see it now: a time when dryad and dwarf were allies against a brutal Master.~
@21 = ~Tell me more about this vision.~
@22 = ~NP: And never will the war end as long as the dead keep coming back. Dryads are reborn after every death, and my people come back again and again. I can't count how many times I've died from the spells of those damned dryads, and every time I've come back here, all healthy and ready to fight. Over and over again.~ /*The spells of the dryads have ended me own life too many times to count, yet every time I reappear here risen, healed and ready to battle and die all over again.*/
@23 = ~That's horrible!~
@24 = ~You are immortal! You get to live forever.~
@25 = ~NP: A snow globe? What a load of crap! The world is the world, as it is, as it is. Nothing can be done about it. And in this world, there's a war going on. An endless war with the tree-huggers and their stupid magic!~ /*Snow globe? Ach, yer talking daft! The world is the world, right enough. There be nothing more to it than that.*/
@26 = ~NP: No, I... I think it was different once, a long time ago. although now all I can remember is the carnage. But sometimes I have this strange dream that dwarves and dryads once fought side by side. There was a time when my clan and the leaf-lovers served the same Master, as if they were slaves to him.~ /*Nay, I... I think once it were different, long ago... though it be hard to recall naught but bloodshed. Yet there be strange images hauntin' me dreams of dwarf and dryad standin' shoulder to shoulder.*/
@27 = ~NP: Yeah, well, I guess I can patch a crack. There's nothing to do, I'll just use a spell to fix it. Stand aside, now we'll invoke magic... Well, the amulet seems to be intact again, but it lacks the magic for full power.~ /*Aye, I suppose I could repair the crack. It be simple enough for me to cast a mending spell on it for ye. Stand back while I work me magic.*/
@28 = ~NP: Well, yes, my clan knows the secrets of magic, but it is only the magic of fire, forge, hammer and anvil. This amulet was forged to hold the power of earth and wood. The dryads have that power, that's for sure. They could make one for you. But they're crazy. You can't even talk to them, they'll attack you. When they see you, they'll attack you. I'm afraid I won't say any more about that amulet.~ /*The dryads have such power, right enough. They could craft it for ye. But the tree huggers be crazed. Ye be a fool if ye try to speak to them as they'll attack ye on sight.*/
@29 = ~NP: I see it. a creature. Cold as the winter chill. A master. And I also see-- oh, it's a little foggy. I see an amulet. Yes, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to kill the Overlord and free us from this existence. Yes, now I remember! Dwarves and Dryads united against a common enemy and-- nah, everything disappears. The Overlord was too powerful. the amulet cracked, the magic was lost, and-- Ð¸...~ /*I see a... beast. Cold as heartless winter. The Master. And I see... ach, 'tis all unclear... I see... the amulet. Aye, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to slay the Master and free us from this existence.*/
@30 = ~NP: There are no cowards in my clan, but endless war won't please anyone. We suffer so much from this dryad magic every time we die, our souls are tormented. I don't know how we got to this point. Life is wrong and unnatural, but we don't know any other way. War, death, rebirth. We can't escape it.~ /*I canna' say how we came to be like this. This life be wrong and... unnatural, but we know no other way. War, death, rebirth... There be no escape for us.*/
@31 = ~But the memories be dark as shadows in the heart of a mine. Maybe me thoughts is not even real. Aye, it truly seems my kin has always been at war with the dryads.~
@32 = ~Ach, the vision be gone. It as if some foul magic has plucked the very memories from me mind. I canna' even see the face of the Master anymore.~
@33 = ~Maybe I could free you from this Master.~
@34 = ~NP: We seek no release but death. Maybe if you kill the Overlord, my clan will find peace... or maybe that lord is long dead. I'm starting to forget. Nah, magic's too strong. The memories that the amulet had awakened are gone: the Overlord, the amulet... No, that's all I have to say.~ /*The only release we seek is death. Maybe, if ye could slay the Master my clan could find peace... but could be the Master already be dead. Even now I begin to forget...*/
@35 = ~Me name be Hodd, leader of this dwarven clan. We don't see yer kind 'round here much. But at least you ain't attackin' us on sight like them crazed dryads!~ [HODD056]
@36 = ~Aye, me an' me clan bid ye greetings once more.~ [HODD054]
