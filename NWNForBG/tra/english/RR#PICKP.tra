@0 = ~MT: Uh? Hey, you! Are you trying to get into my pocket?~ /*Sorry, could you repeat that one more time?*/
@1 = ~MT: \[Intelligence\] - I am shocked by the groundlessness of your accusations. I have been anywhere but near you, and I have a whole group of witnesses who will confirm this.~ [Интеллект\] /*Of course I know that Xanos. You both have lived up to my expectations and more. I have information that changes much, however.*/
@2 = ~MT: \[Wisdom\] - Think with your head before making such unfounded statements. I was in a hurry and probably caught you walking by. But no one got hurt.~ [Мудрость\] /*No, it's better if I don't say anything. There's a rule about the Gauntlet. I forget what it is, though, because nobody talks about it.*/
@3 = ~MT: \[Charisma\] - I assure you, this is not my doing. But I saw a wrapped silhouette passing by. Could this be the real culprit?~ [Харизма\] /*That said... this plague is not her doing, though we are quite happy to accept tribute from people trying to appease her anyway.*/
@4 = ~MT: \[Knowledge\] - On the contrary. I was fascinated by this thing that fell out of your pocket and just wanted to take a closer look at it before returning it to you.~ [Знания\] /*The high-backed throne looms out of the shadows, drawing your attention. Something in the design of it fills your heart with dread.*/
@5 = ~MT: \[Reputation\] - Hmm, I'll kindly remind you that you're talking to an honorable citizen. Your wallet was dangling from your belt and about to fall. I just wanted to correct him and warn you.~ [Репутация\] /*I knew we could count on you to repeat your success in this district. I had heard good things about you.*/
@6 = ~MT: \[Reputation\] - Maybe you shouldn't make me angry, huh? Shut your mouth and get out of here while you can.~ [Репутация\] /*"Ummm... maybe we should lets sleeping dragons lie, boss? You not thinks so?"*/
@7 = ~MT: (Trying to run away)~ /*Always run*/
@8 = ~MT: What audacity! And again you're trying to rob me!~ /*How often will you help me?*/
@9 = ~MT: This is the last straw! I won't be robbed by the likes of you!~ /*I am not a mule! I refuse to carry everything!*/
@10 = ~MT: Hmm... This time you'll get off with just a warning. This time...~ /*I thought maybe you'd sweeten your offer...*/
@11 = ~MT: However, from now on, I will keep a closer eye on you!~ /*Lore Examine the panel more closely.*/
@12 = ~MT: Ba! I'll close my eyes this time too, but don't try it again!~ /*Ugh! Okay, Me lead you, but yous don't get in way!*/
@13 = ~MT: Great! But remember well, this is the last warning!~ /*Fine. Take the gem, but give us the child.*/
@14 = ~MT: Run wherever you want, thief! But this dirty theft will soon be known!~ /*If you gots stuff to say, saying it now!*/
@15 = ~MT: This is it! No more apologies!~ /*More Spells*/
@16 = ~MT: This time I will report this brazen robbery attempt! Now get out of my sight!~ /*You are an evil wretch who does not deserve the services of Tyr! Get out of my sight!*/
@17 = ~MT: Again, yes, thief? You don't have it! These pitiful attempts at theft must be cut down.~ /*You again, is it? Have you changed your mind about entering the prison for me?*/
