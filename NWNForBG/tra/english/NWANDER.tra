@0 = ~NP: Hello, sir. Do you need anything? Is there something you want to ask me?~ [NWEND052] /*Hello, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. Is there something the matter? Did you have something to ask of me?*/
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~I spoke with Neurik. He said I should see you.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~NP: Yes, please. It's probably Black Wolf questions again, I think. And what do you want to hear?~ /*Oh. He said it was okay to tell you about the Black Wolf, I guess? Do you want to hear about that, then?*/
@6 = ~NP: Tell me again about your encounter with this beast.~ /*Tell me 'bout caves again.*/
@7 = ~NP: Where is Black Wolf Cave?~ /*Where was the Black Wolf's cave again?*/
@8 = ~Do you know where the others might be?~
@9 = ~What can you tell me of Alhelor?~
@10 = ~I hope you enjoy your time in Port Llast. Goodbye.~
@11 = ~NP: May the gods bless you, sir!~ /*Nature's blessing!*/
@12 = ~NP: My name is Ender, sir. I help Elhelor here when he needs it.~ /*My name is Ander, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I help Alhelor here when he has need of it.*/
@13 = ~NP: He sells merchandise for werewolf hunters. Ever since my encounter with the werewolf, I've decided to dedicate my life to fighting these horrible creatures. But I can't fight them, so I'm helping Elhelor, so it's a good thing.~ /*I know it sounds silly. I... met a werewolf myself, though, and if Alhelor's goods can help fight them, then I'm proud to help him.*/
@14 = ~What's this about a werewolf?~
@15 = ~You don't remember me? Oh, maybe not... my name is Ander and I help Alhelor sell his werewolf remedies.~
@16 = ~Werewolf remedies?~
@17 = ~NP: Я... I know Elchelor likes it, but I shouldn't talk about it, I'm sorry. But you can ask Newrick about this monster if you want.~ /*I... I know Alhelor likes to, but I really shouldn't talk about it, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I'm sorry. You could ask Neurik about the beast, though, if you wanted.*/
@18 = ~Why can't you talk about it?~
@19 = ~Who is this Neurik?~
@20 = ~NP: Я... I guess it's okay if we talk about it, since Newrick said it was okay. He said I should try to forget. stop thinking about it all the time. I don't know. I try. Sometimes I feel kind of normal, and then... All I could see were these eyes looking out of the cave, and it was like I knew something was wrong - total panic. Anyway...~ /*I... I suppose there's no harm in talking about it, if Neurik says it's okay. He said that I should try to forget about it... stop thinking about it so much. I don't know. I try. Sometimes I feel kind of normal, and then -*/
@21 = ~NP: Karatis was a werewolf hunter, and he came to hunt the Black Wolf! The one we called the werewolf of Port Llast. Karathis needed some help, so I and a few of my friends volunteered: Bran, Geth, and Urth. We didn't think the wolf was real at all, and Karathis was paying well. Together we, uh. we went hunting for the Black Wolf. We found the wolf's tracks and followed them to the cave. While we were setting up camp, Karatis went there. It's right next to Luskan, this cave. in the mountains east of the Green Gryphon.~ /*Karathis wanted some help, so me and some friends volunteered: Bran, Geth, and Urth. We didn't think there was any real wolf, anyway, and Karathis' coin was good. Together, we... began the hunt for the Black Wolf.*/

@23 = ~Not long after we set up camp, Karathis came out but as a werewolf. I was so scared! I can still see his face so clearly... I couldn't help but run. We all ran. I'm the only one that... got away. The rest are probably beasts now, too. Or dead.~
@24 = ~NP: Why did Karatis enter the cave alone?~ /*Why didn't you go into it?*/
@25 = ~Is... is this about my encounter with the Black Wolf? I really shouldn't talk about it, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I'm sorry. You could ask Neurik about the beast, I'm sure. Uh... unless you want something else?~
@26 = ~I know it sounds silly. I... met a werewolf myself, though, and if Alhelor's goods can help fight them, then I'm proud to help him.~
@27 = ~Tell me about your encounter with the werewolf.~
@28 = ~Oh. He said it was okay to tell you about the Black Wolf, I guess? Do you want to hear about that, then?~
@29 = ~Yes, tell me.~
@30 = ~No, thanks.~
@31 = ~Well... it's not that I can't. Neurik says I shouldn't talk about it if I want to... to stop thinking about it. If he said it was okay, though, I guess I could...~
@32 = ~He is the priest at the temple of Tyr. He knows a lot about the Black Wolf. Well... he knows a lot about everything, really.~
@33 = ~He was too worried about us, and he thought it was his duty. I don't think I could have gone in alone, or even with him. I don't think I could ever go back to that cave, either.~
@34 = ~Why did Karathis need your help then?~
@35 = ~Are you sure the beast was Karathis?~
@36 = ~The only thing I can think is something he said right after I got back from the cave. It wasn't bad, just seemed out of place.~
@37 = ~What did he say?~
@38 = ~He said he would keep me safe from werewolves so long as I helped him to sell his stuff. I don't think it means anything, though.~
@39 = ~NP: He was afraid Black Wolf would try to escape. He wanted us to stop him from escaping. and we didn't know what to do when he went in there and came out a beast. I'm sorry if, uh. you don't need anything else, do you?~ /*He was afraid that the Black Wolf would try to escape. He wanted us to keep it from running away... we didn't know what to do when he went in and came out a beast...*/
@40 = ~NP: I - I think so. He was dressed like Karatis, and even had a similar appearance to him. He looked like he was in pain, and also confusion.... I don't know if I'll ever be able to forget that vision as long as I live...~ /*I - I think it was. It was dressed up like Karathis, and even looked like him in the face. He looks like he was in pain, and confused...*/
@41 = ~It was a cave just outside of Luskan, in the hills east of the Green Griffon.~
@42 = ~You mean Urth, Bran and Geth? I know places that they liked to go before - I haven't been able to look yet... I want to, but I... can't.~
@43 = ~You know where Urth could be?~
@44 = ~How about Bran? Where would he go?~
@45 = ~Maybe you can tell me where to look for Geth?~
@46 = ~What about Sir Karathis? Where would he be?~
@47 = ~His family might know. I want to ask them myself, but... I'm too ashamed to speak to them. I don't know what happened to Urth, and I think they likely hate me. If you want to ask them about Urth, they live on the south side of town. Just... don't say anything about me.~ /*His family might know. I want to ask them myself, but... I'm too ashamed to speak to them. I don't know what happened to Urth, and I think they likely hate me.*/
@48 = ~Bran liked the mysteriousness of Charwood. I wouldn't be surprised if he's there now. If you find him, tell him I said hello... that I'm still thinkin' about him.~
@49 = ~Geth was the one that talked me into doing this... he always dragged me out to the Neverwinter Wood and we'd pretend we were heroes. Maybe he went there.~
@50 = ~I guess you could look at that werewolf's den? I don't really know. He wasn't from around here, so he might have left for anywhere.~
@51 = ~You've got to go and kill that Black Wolf, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Please, before he hurts anyone else!~
@52 = ~NP: Remind me again where the Black Wolf Cave is?~ /*Where was the Black Wolf's cave again?*/
@53 = ~NP: Where's Elchelor now?~ /*"Where is the Hero now?"*/
@54 = ~NP: Could you sell me something from Elchelor's shop?~ /*Now can you show me what happened here?*/
@55 = ~If you're looking for Alhelor, he went home to get some rest. Maybe I could answer a question for you?~ [NWEND051]
@56 = ~Who is Alhelor?~
@57 = ~Ander... Alhelor is really the Black Wolf.~
@58 = ~Tell me where this Alhelor lives.~
@59 = ~NP: That's too bad, I was gonna buy some gear from him.~ /*Where can I buy some equipment?*/
@60 = ~My name is Ander, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I help Alhelor here when he has need of it.~
@61 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. He's a peddler... he's usually here, but he said he was tired and went home early. He lives near the pond of water at the town's center. It's a fairly small house. Modest, you know? Maybe you can stop in tomorrow? We sell the best collection of werewolf remedies around. Well, we're the only ones selling stuff like that... but we're the best!~ /*Oh, I'm sorry. He's a peddler... he's usually here, but he said he was tired and went home early. He lives near the pond of water at the town's center. It's a fairly small house. Modest, you know?*/
@62 = ~NP: He lives in the northeast part of town. He's got a little house, humble, you know. Elhelor can usually be found here, but he said he was tired.~ /*Oh. He lives near the pond of water at the town's center. It's a fairly small house. Modest, you know? Alhelor's usually here, but he said he was tired.*/
@63 = ~NP: W-what? That can't be true. Is this some kind of joke, sir?~ /*Wh-what? That can't be right. Are you joking with me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/
@64 = ~I'm not joking, Ander. I wanted to warn you.~
@65 = ~I know it sounds strange, but I will get to the bottom of this.~
@66 = ~Just tell me if you've seen him since he left.~
@67 = ~I... that's so... I don't doubt your word, though. Alhelor was always a bit odd, somehow. I just never suspected... what a fool I've been! Thank you for telling me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll definitely watch out for him. I haven't seen Alhelor since he went back to his home by the pond. If you hurry, you can catch him there and kill him once and for all!~ /*Thank you for telling me, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll definitely watch out for him. I haven't seen Alhelor since he went back to his home by the pond. If you hurry, you can catch him there and kill him once and for all!*/
@68 = ~NP: Elhelor's gone home, it's a small house in the northeast of town. Please end this beast, I'm afraid.~ /*Check the northeast of town, a fella named Ballard.*/
@69 = ~NP: Could you sell me some of his merchandise?~ /*Why didn't you just poison his food?*/
@70 = ~NP: I'll do it, goodbye.~ /*I will do this for you.*/
@71 = ~NP: It's finally over. Elhelor is dead, but I know I'll still have trouble falling asleep at night. Did you want something from me?~ [NWEND050] /*It's finally over. Neurik says that Alhelor is dead, but I know I'll still have trouble falling asleep at night. Did you want me for something?*/
@72 = ~NP: Trouble sleeping? I think that's a new one.~ /*Neurik? Alhelor? Sleeping troubles? Did I miss something?*/
@73 = ~What do you plan on doing now?~
@74 = ~Oh, I'm sorry. I thought... oh, nevermind. It's a long story and it's all wrapped up now. Needless to say, we won't have to worry about werewolves any more around here now that Alhelor's gone.~
@75 = ~I don't know. I'm a bit confused. Angry, too. I can't believe Alhelor tricked us all like that! I thought he really wanted to help kill werewolves. I feel so stupid. Worse, now I've got nothing to do... my friends are all dead, and I can't help Alhelor run his shop anymore, obviously. (sigh)~ /*I don't know. I'm a bit confused. Angry, too. I can't believe Alhelor tricked us all like that! I thought he really wanted to help kill werewolves.*/
@76 = ~Maybe you should open your own shop?~
@77 = ~NP: I think you should leave.~ /*I think you should move on, then.*/
@78 = ~NP: You must have saved up money while you were helping Elchelor?~ /*You must have made some money helping Alhelor, no?*/
@79 = ~Yes, you're pretty useless, all right.~
@80 = ~Open my own shop...? I... I suppose I could. Alhelor must still have some of his supplies somewhere. Yes... yes, maybe I will!~
@81 = ~NP: Okay, give it a shot.~ /*Okays, me go.*/
@82 = ~Here... 100 gold to help you out.~
@83 = ~You mean leave Port Llast? I... I guess you're right. Maybe I should, there's nothing for me here...~
@84 = ~NP: You can't even find your way out of town!~ /*Are you kidding? You couldn't find your way out of town!*/
@85 = ~Just... just a little bit. I helped him mostly for the experience.~
@86 = ~Good. Hand over the coin, then, and be quick about it.~
@87 = ~NP: I... I thought... I'm sorry... I... I should probably go...~ /*Ex-excuse me... maybe I should... maybe I should go...*/
@88 = ~NP: Thank you! Thank you, sir. you've been so helpful!~ /*Thank you! Thank you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>... you've been a great help!*/
@89 = ~A... hundred gold? That's so generous of you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I... I can't thank you enough for your help. Bless you!~
@90 = ~What? You're... you're robbing me? Is there nobody decent in this world? F-fine! T-take it! Take it all!~
@91 = ~NP: Elhelor has instructed me to replace him, here are all his wares, take your pick.~ /*There's no replacement for family but you look like a friendly face...*/
@92 = ~NP: He went home for a little break.~ /*I need to sit down, just for a bit.*/
