@0 = ~Oh, stop waving that about, will you? I won't be intimidated.~
@1 = ~The guards let more <PRO_RACE> kind into Blacklake, did they?~
@2 = ~NP: Oh, get away. You must be spreading the plague.~ /*Oh, do go away. I'll not catch the plague from just any old <PRO_RACE> type, no sir.*/
@3 = ~Err... no, no, I have nothing against Meldanen. No need to ask me twice.~
@4 = ~Well, I say good riddance! That Meldanen was a nuisance to us all!~
@5 = ~I knew that Formosa girl was going to get herself into trouble with all that talk about the sorcerer. Tsk.~
@6 = ~What does she want, anyway? To give all of the sorcerer's wealth to the poor? Ludicrous!~
@7 = ~You don't think that Formosa actually had something to do with the sorcerer's death, do you? No, no, that's too silly...~
@8 = ~I hear the sorcerer had all sorts of evil creatures in his home. I think it's high time someone killed him!~
@9 = ~So... ahhh... Formosa is dead, is she? Err... good job, <PRO_SIRMAAM>...~
@10 = ~I don't wish to end up like Formosa. No, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, not me.~
@11 = ~I can't believe how she's going on about the sorcerer! She'll get us all killed!~
@12 = ~Meldanen dead! Have you heard? Unbelieveable!~
@13 = ~Formosa dead! Shocking!!~
@14 = ~Take a word of advice: ignore Formosa and her ranting. She'll just get us all into trouble, she will.~
@15 = ~Oh dear... this is just all going to bring the plague down upon us, isn't it?~
@16 = ~The Wailing Death has claimed so many lives. It's such a waste.~
