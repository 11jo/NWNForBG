@0 = ~<CHARNAME> - I am not surprised to see you here. You have become quite the thorn in Maugrim's side. Though he would never admit it, I believe you have impressed him with your accomplishments.~ [NWARI533]
@1 = ~I, however, am not too proud to admit my respect for you. You have thwarted us at almost every turn, <CHARNAME>. Yet in the end Morag's will cannot be denied.~ [NWARI534]
@2 = ~Neverwinter shall not fall to your army, Aribeth!~
@3 = ~If you surrender I will let you live.~
@4 = ~The time for words is past, Aribeth. Defend yourself!~
@5 = ~Time to die, traitor!~
@6 = ~You have already lost, <CHARNAME>. My troops control the city; soon even Castle Never will fall. The streets will run red with the blood of Neverwinter's children.~ [NWARI535]
@7 = ~I was about to make you the same offer, <CHARNAME> - though I suspect Maugrim would rather sacrifice you to his new Queen.~ [NWARI536]
@8 = ~So be it. We shall settle this with blood!~ [NWARI491]
@9 = ~Morag is a voracious mistress - it seems there are never enough dead to satisfy her hunger.~ [NWARI537]
@10 = ~Is that why you kill the innocent of Neverwinter?~
@11 = ~You dare call these people innocent? The citizens of Neverwinter screamed for Fenthick's death - and Lord Nasher gave it to them!~ [NWARI538]
@12 = ~His blood is on their hands, <CHARNAME>. We are all guilty here, and we are all deserving of death.~ [NWARI539]
@13 = ~Is that why you destroyed Neverwinter? Out of a perverted sense of justice?~
@14 = ~Justice? There is no such thing. I came here for vengeance. But I am not responsible for Neverwinter's fall.~ [NWARI540]
@15 = ~My position at the head of the armies only hastened the inevitable end, <CHARNAME>. Neverwinter was doomed as soon as Maugrim unleashed the Wailing Death.~ [NWARI541]
@16 = ~Can you not feel it in the air? An evil cloud covers the city - the shadow of Morag. The Queen of the Old Ones has awakened, and none shall survive her coming.~ [NWARI542]
@17 = ~Morag is just using you, Aribeth! She'll kill you as soon as you've served her purpose.~
@18 = ~I am no blind fool like Maugrim. I know Morag will betray me. In fact, I'm counting on it. I deserve death for what I have done.~ [NWARI543]
@19 = ~But when I die I will have the satisfaction of knowing Neverwinter was made to pay for what happened to Fenthick!~ [NWARI544]
@20 = ~There is nothing more to say, <CHARNAME>. It is too late for words. We must settle this in blood.~ [NWARI545]
@21 = ~You have come far since our first meeting, <CHARNAME>. I can no longer stand against you.~ [NWARI546]
@22 = ~Had Morag foreseen how powerful you would become, perhaps she would have chosen you to be her champion instead of turning her lidless eye in my direction.~ [NWARI547]
@23 = ~I would never bow down to the Queen of the Old Ones!~
@24 = ~If she had I wouldn't quit in the middle of a fight!~
@25 = ~Put up your sword and die with honor!~
@26 = ~Answer my questions and I might let you live!~
@27 = ~I... I suppose that is true. You have the strength of your convictions, something I lost long ago.~ [NWARI548]
@28 = ~Tell me, <CHARNAME> - how can you go on, knowing you fight for a city that is doomed to fall when the Old Ones return?~ [NWARI549]
@29 = ~I still believe Neverwinter can be saved.~
@30 = ~I am the one who will ask the questions, Aribeth.~
@31 = ~Die, traitor! Die!~
@32 = ~Honor? I learned long ago there is no such thing. Honor is but a myth. Death, vengeance and despair - these are real.~ [NWARI591]
@33 = ~Let me live? You can do no such thing, <CHARNAME>. You serve Neverwinter, you have no choice but to end my existence. Death might actually be a blessing for me, in any case. I grow so very weary with this life.~ [NWARI593] /*Let me live? You can do no such thing, <CHARNAME>. You serve Neverwinter, you have no choice but to end my existence.*/
@34 = ~NP: I've seen the future in my dreams. Neverwinter will disappear in an all-consuming blaze when the Ancients are reborn. It's inevitable.~ [NWARI550] /*I have seen the future in my dreams, <CHARNAME>. Neverwinter will vanish in a blaze of flame when the Old Ones are reborn - it is inevitable.*/
@35 = ~There is still hope.~
@36 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@37 = ~The only thing inevitable is your death!~
@38 = ~I am at your mercy, <CHARNAME>. Ask your questions and I will answer them.~ [NWARI552]
@39 = ~Where are Maugrim and the Word of Power?~
@40 = ~Tell me about Morag.~
@41 = ~How did you come to this, Aribeth? Surely there is more to it than Fenthick's death.~
@42 = ~I cannot let you live after what you have done.~
@43 = ~Come then, <CHARNAME> - deliver me to the fate I have brought upon myself.~ [NWARI545]
@44 = ~Hope? All hope within my heart perished with Fenthick. He was taken from me, the light of my life, and I was left alone in the empty darkness.~ [NWARI551]
@45 = ~You're just stalling! Time to die, Aribeth!~
@46 = ~NP: Maugrim has the Word of Power in his room. The door can be opened with only a key. We knew you would come, <CHARNAME>. That's why I'm here instead of leading the Luscan army. I was supposed to protect Maugrim from you. But that, like everything else, I failed.~ [NWARI553] /*Maugrim has the Word of Power in his room - through the door to the east. We knew you were coming, <CHARNAME>. That is why I am here rather than leading Luskan's army.*/
@47 = ~What can I tell you of the Queen of the Old Ones that you do not already know? She is ancient and cruel, powerful and cunning.~ [NWARI555]
@48 = ~Is the execution of my lover not justification enough for what I have become? They say I betrayed Neverwinter, but Neverwinter betrayed Fenthick first!~ [NWARI558]
@49 = ~I know this, <CHARNAME>. And yet, I would speak with you before you end my life. So you might understand why I did what I did.~ [NWARI590]
@50 = ~Even now her spectre has descended upon the city, inflaming the spirits of the Luskan army and drowning Neverwinter's defenders in hopeless despair.~ [NWARI556]
@51 = ~With Fenthick's death I lost more than a lover! He was a devoted servant of both Tyr and Neverwinter, and I saw how his devotion was repaid!~ [NWARI559]
@52 = ~The world we know will be consumed in the flames of Morag's return, until only the bitter ashes of sorrow and death remain.~ [NWARI557]
@53 = ~How could I believe in a god who allowed such an atrocity? How could I serve a city so mercilessly cruel? When Fenthick was executed I lost my lover, my faith, my loyalty - everything I believed in crumbled around me!~ [NWARI560]
@54 = ~It sounds like you're trying to justify what you did.~
@55 = ~You were angry and you sought revenge. You acted like a child!~
@56 = ~You're right - Neverwinter brought this upon itself.~
@57 = ~I... I am simply telling you what happened, <CHARNAME>. How I... how I came to break my vows and betray all that I stood for.~ [NWARI561]
@58 = ~It is not too late, Aribeth. There is still a chance to make things right.~
@59 = ~You can never make up for the evil you have done, Aribeth.~
@60 = ~Perhaps... perhaps you are right. Perhaps, had I acted differently... but it is too late for me now, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI587]
@61 = ~Fenthick's death set in motion events that could not be stopped. In the end Morag will awaken the Old Ones and we are all doomed.~ [NWARI588]
@62 = ~Look around you, <CHARNAME>. Look at the death and destruction I have brought to Neverwinter. I can never make up for this.~ [NWARI562]
@63 = ~And I have been too long under Morag's power. The Queen has a... a hold on me. I could not stand with you against her, even if... even if I wanted to. I cannot help the city.~ [NWARI563]
@64 = ~Your knowledge of the Luskan forces could save hundreds of lives.~
@65 = ~It's too dangerous to let you live. You must die, Aribeth!~
@66 = ~I have chosen a path of hatred and bloody vengeance, and from this path there is no escape. It is too late for me. It is too late for us all.~ [NWARI589]
@67 = ~I could bring my information to Lord Nasher and Aarin Gend, true. But it would not be enough to turn the tide of the battle. Morag's power will bring victory to the Luskan troops.~ [NWARI564]
@68 = ~Perhaps a few hundred lives could be saved, though the city would still fall. But what will that avail me? Lord Nasher would still have me executed for what I have done.~ [NWARI565]
@69 = ~Lord Nasher has promised me he would be lenient if you surrendered to him.~
@70 = ~You would do this to save the people of Neverwinter, not to save yourself.~
@71 = ~Do you think I am a fool, <CHARNAME>? I know Lord Nasher too well to believe such tripe!~ [NWARI566]
@72 = ~I should sacrifice myself for the sake of the people who demanded Fenthick's blood? Do you really believe me capable of so selfless an act, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI567]
@73 = ~Once I would have gladly sacrificed myself for this city. But I have changed, <CHARNAME>. I am no longer the Aribeth you knew. Now I walk a different path.~ [NWARI568]
@74 = ~The woman who gave me this ring would not have said such a thing.~
@75 = ~Look inside yourself, Aribeth. You may discover you have not changed as much as you think.~
@76 = ~You cannot undo what you have done. But you can change the path you are on.~
@77 = ~You... you kept my ring? After my betrayal? After all the death and misery I have brought to you and the city? But... but why?~ [NWARI569]
@78 = ~To remember you as you once were, Aribeth. And in the hopes you would one day remember yourself.~
@79 = ~There... there is a part of me that still weeps when I see the destruction of Neverwinter. Perhaps... perhaps you are right, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI586]
@80 = ~You are wasting your time, <CHARNAME>. I am beyond your power to save.~ [NWARI585]
@81 = ~Your words are... wise, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps... perhaps I can set aside my hatred.~ [NWARI573]
@82 = ~I... I am not who I once was, <CHARNAME>. I... I cannot... it would not be possible... I cannot go back. Not after what I have done.~ [NWARI570]
@83 = ~Then go forward. Leave your hate and vengeance behind.~
@84 = ~Remember who you are, Aribeth. Look into your heart.~
@85 = ~If I... if I turn myself over to Lord Nasher for execution... Many lives may yet be saved. At least... at least then my own death would have some meaning.~ [NWARI574]
@86 = ~But you... you will have to trust me in this, <CHARNAME>. Maugrim waits for you behind this door, you must face him now - time is of the essence.~ [NWARI575]
@87 = ~But I dare not accompany you, for fear I will fall once again under Morag's spell. Do you trust me enough to let me go, if I vow to surrender myself to Lord Nasher? Can you take that risk?~ [NWARI576]
@88 = ~I trust you to do what is right, Aribeth.~
@89 = ~Then... I shall leave Maugrim to you, and I... I shall deliver myself to Lord Nasher and tell him what I know of the Luskan troop movements.~ [NWARI577]
@90 = ~If we are lucky, my information may help some of Neverwinter's citizens escape with their lives. And I... I will submit to Lord Nasher's judgment, whatever the consequences may be.~ [NWARI578]
@91 = ~I am grateful to you for this, <CHARNAME>- this chance to... to do what is right. I wanted you to know that before I go, in case... in case Lord Nasher has me executed before you return.~ [NWARI579]
@92 = ~Go to meet your fate with honor, Lady Aribeth.~
@93 = ~Nasher may be more merciful than you think.~
@94 = ~This is madness! Flee this place, Aribeth - escape with your life!~
@95 = ~Join with me, Aribeth - together we can defeat Maugrim and Morag!~
@96 = ~What was I thinking? I can't trust you - you're a traitor!~
@97 = ~Lady Aribeth? It has been a long time since anyone called me that. Thank you, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI580]
@98 = ~Your words are kind, <CHARNAME>, but I am ready for whatever awaits.~ [NWARI581]
@99 = ~NP: If I run away, it means I haven't learned my lesson. I'm willing to accept the consequences of my actions, whatever they may be.~ [NWARI582] /*No, <CHARNAME>. If I run away it will mean I have learned nothing. I am ready to accept the consequences of what I have done - whatever those consequences may be.*/
@100 = ~No! I... I dare not. I have served Morag for too long. She had a... a hold over me. I am afraid if I must face her or Maugrim I might once again fall under her sway.~ [NWARI583]
@101 = ~NP: I, uh. I should go to Lord Nasher while I'm still determined. You'll have to fight Maugrim without me. Farewell, <CHARNAME>, and good luck to you. Take this amulet, it will remove the magical protection from the stairs and door to get to where Maugrim is hiding.~ [NWARI584] /*I... I must go to Lord Nasher now, while my resolve is still strong. You must face Maugrim without me. Goodbye, <CHARNAME> - and good luck.*/
@102 = ~It is good to see you again, <CHARNAME>. When I surrendered to Lord Nasher I was certain my execution would be swift.~ [NWARI493]
@103 = ~But it seems Lord Nasher has chosen to let me live... for now, at least. I am glad, if for no other reason than it gives me a chance to see you again.~ [NWARI494]
@104 = ~How are feeling, Aribeth?~
@105 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@106 = ~I have no wish to talk to traitors!~
@107 = ~I must be on my way.~
@108 = ~I am at peace, <CHARNAME> - for the first time since Fenthick's death. And I have you to thank. You saved me.~ [NWARI496]
@109 = ~Saved you? But you're to be executed.~
@110 = ~I am glad you have found peace, Aribeth.~
@111 = ~I have already given most of my information to Aarin Gend and Lord Nasher - Luskan battle plans and the location of their troops. But I will try to help you however I can.~ [NWARI520]
@112 = ~I want to know about Morag and the Old Ones.~
@113 = ~Tell me about the Source Stone.~
@114 = ~What do you know about the Words of Power?~
@115 = ~I... I suppose I should not be surprised by your anger. I make no effort to defend my actions, though I thought you, of all people, might not judge me so harshly.~ [NWARI517]
@116 = ~NP: I understand. You still have a lot of work to do. I wish you luck, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI519] /*I understand. There is still much that must be done if Morag is to be defeated. I wish you luck, <CHARNAME>.*/
@117 = ~NP: If fate favors us, we can continue this conversation after Morag is killed.~ [NWARI505] /*You just says if you seen him since he go.*/
@118 = ~The Old Ones are an ancient and evil race distantly related to the lizardmen of our own time. Morag was their queen during the height of their empire.~ [NWARI521]
@119 = ~The Source Stone is a great gem located in long forgotten chambers beneath Castle Never. Within this gem is an entire other world, a realm where Morag and her people await the time of the awakening.~ [NWARI524]
@120 = ~As you know, there were four Words of Power. At first, Maugrim seemed to believe we would need to possess all four Words to awaken Morag.~ [NWARI526]
@121 = ~I hope... I hope you will one day set aside your hate, as I have set aside mine. Perhaps then we can speak as we once did.~ [NWARI518]
@122 = ~But the world changed and the North became a frozen waste, and Morag placed her people in a magical stasis within the Source Stone to await the time of their awakening.~ [NWARI522]
@123 = ~I know the Words of Power were somehow connected with raising Morag and her people from their slumber, but beyond this there is little I can tell you.~ [NWARI525]
@124 = ~However, as Morag's power grew she sent Maugrim a vision of a ritual that could begin the awakening with only one of the Words.~ [NWARI527]
@125 = ~More than this I cannot say. When I served Morag I cared little for the reasons behind the attack on Neverwinter. I only cared about revenge. But I am finally free of that burden.~ [NWARI523]
@126 = ~But the ritual was only partially successful. Morag was awakened - but she was still trapped within the Source Stone.~ [NWARI528]
@127 = ~In time Morag's power will grow until she is able to release herself and her people from the Source Stone, but for now she is trapped inside. I wish I could tell you more, but that is all I know.~ [NWARI529]
@128 = ~I no longer fear my fate, <CHARNAME>. When Fenthick... when Fenthick was executed I thought I had lost everything. But now I see this is not true.~ [NWARI497]
@129 = ~I have you, <CHARNAME>. You were there when I was in my darkest hour, you were there when I needed you - but I was too blind to see.~ [NWARI498]
@130 = ~But you never gave up on me. I have found myself again, <CHARNAME>. And I finally see how... how special you are to me.~ [NWARI499]
@131 = ~You are special to me as well, Aribeth.~
@132 = ~I care for you too, Aribeth - but I can never forgive you for what you have done.~
@133 = ~They say it is better to have loved and lost than not to have loved at all. I never used to believe that, <CHARNAME>.. until now.~ [NWARI500]
@134 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME> - you have every right to feel that way. I only wanted to tell you the truth that is within my own heart.~ [NWARI507]
@135 = ~I loved Fenthick with all my heart, and his memory will always be dear to me. But that does not mean I can never love another. Perhaps in time we might... if things had been different...~ [NWARI501]
@136 = ~NP: No, Aribeth, don't do this to me. Not when I know I'm about to lose you.~ /*No, Aribeth - don't do this to me. It isn't fair to tell me this. Not now, when I know I will soon lose you.*/
@137 = ~But things aren't different. You are a prisoner sentenced to execution.~
@138 = ~You have done more for me than you can ever know, and for this I will always have special feelings for you.~ [NWARI508]
@139 = ~But I see this makes you uncomfortable, so we shall speak of this no more. Is there something else I might do for you?~ [NWARI509]
@140 = ~Lord Nasher has not passed judgment on me yet. I am content with whatever fate awaits, but in his eyes I see hope that I might live.~ [NWARI502]
@141 = ~Should Neverwinter survive, he may chose another sentence for me. I may yet be given a chance to make some small amends for what I have done. There is yet hope for me... and for us.~ [NWARI503]
@142 = ~Forgive me for speaking so frankly about this, <CHARNAME>. My heart could not stay silent, but I should not have burdened you with this - not while you still must face Morag.~ [NWARI504]
@143 = ~Please, Aribeth - I wish to speak more of this.~
@144 = ~Your words are no burden to me, Aribeth. In truth, they lighten the load I carry.~
@145 = ~You are right, Aribeth - I must concentrate on the task at hand.~
@146 = ~If fate is kind, perhaps we will be able to continue this once Morag is slain. But while she lives we must set our own feelings aside for the greater good.~ [NWARI505]
@147 = ~Perhaps if I had learned this lesson long ago, tragedy could have been averted. Forgive me, but I will speak of my feelings for you no more. You must concentrate on the task at hand.~ [NWARI506]
