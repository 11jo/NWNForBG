@0 = ~MT: Я не возражаю.~ /*Don't mind if I do.*/
@1 = ~Since the defense called the accused to the stand, I claim my right to cross-examine this killer. I will keep this brief, much like poor Griff's life. Rolgan, you are an Uthgardt warrior?~
@2 = ~And you earned this honor and respect on the battlefield, with the edge of your blade. What would happen to your precious honor if people found out you had gambled away everything you owned?~
@3 = ~But you thought if Griff were to die, you could recover those heirlooms before anyone found out. Too bad his friends caught you in the act, killer! Wait, nevermind, don't answer. I withdraw the question. I wouldn't want to prejudice the jury.~
@4 = ~I shall move on to my closing arguments. This will be short, since the Uthgardt is so obviously guilty. Rolgan owed Griff money. Two witnesses saw Rolgan kill Griff. What could be more simple?~
@5 = ~Do your duty, members of the jury. Find Rolgan guilty of murder, and let justice be done. Such is the will of Tyr. If it pleases the court, the prosecution rests.~
@6 = ~Hmph. Hardly a convincing argument...~
@7 = ~We know Griff was a violent man who hated the Uthgardt. He probably started the fight himself.~
@8 = ~Because he was drunk, Rolgan is clearly not responsible for his actions.~
@9 = ~Griff spiked Rolgan's drink, making Rolgan more prone to act irrationally.~
@10 = ~Griff cheated at cards, and when he saw Rolgan he attacked him out of fear Rolgan had found out.~
@11 = ~MT: Семейные ценности, которые забрал Грифф, являлись религиозными артефактами для Племени Черного Льва.~ /*The heirlooms Griff had taken were valuable religious artifacts of great value to the Black Lion tribe.*/
@12 = ~Rolgan is here because he is an Uthgardt, an outsider. Don't let your racist prejudices judge him.~
@13 = ~The defense rests its case.~
@14 = ~Luckily there are no witnesses to disprove this claim!~
@15 = ~An excuse, not a defense.~
@16 = ~Sure, blame the victim!~
@17 = ~MT: Какая абсурдная теория заговора! В следующий раз вы обвините в убийстве Гриффа!~ /*A preposterous conspiracy theory! Next you'll blame the Night Masks for Griff's murder!*/
@18 = ~That gave Rolgan the motive for the killing but it hardly justifies murder!~
@19 = ~Oh, sure, no one but an Uthgardt has ever been accused of a crime by these courts! I guess the execution of Fenthick was all a dream, because we don't arrest anyone but the Uthgardt!~
@20 = ~But... this is impossible! I never lose! I'm Igland the Swift Sword! I'm the greatest prosecutor who ever lived! The jury must have been bribed! I demand an appeal! This is an outrage!~
@21 = ~Yes! In this corner, still undefeated, the greatest prosecutor of all time... Me! Ha-ha-ha-ha!~
