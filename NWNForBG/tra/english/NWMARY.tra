@0 = ~Yes? What brings you here?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I'll answer a question or two... provided you don't take too long.~
@4 = ~I'm curious about some recent events...~
@5 = ~Anything interesting going on in these parts?~
@6 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@7 = ~NP: Yes Yes,<DAYNIGHT> at the end, and I have a lot to do.~ /*Yes, yes. My <DAYNIGHTALL> chores are beckoning.*/
@8 = ~You're not here regarding Pete and the wolves, are you?~
@9 = ~Yes, the wolves. What can you tell me about them?~
@10 = ~Actually I'm hunting down a cult...~
@11 = ~How many of you live here?~
@12 = ~NP: I would like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@13 = ~Other than Peter and the wolves, there's not much to say, really. What might you have in mind?~
@14 = ~Tell me about the wolves, then.~
@15 = ~I'd be interested in work, if you know of anything.~
@16 = ~Are there any other places you think I should stop by, here?~
@17 = ~NP: Very good, just don't forget that<DAYNIGHT> already ending, and I have a lot to do.~ /*Very well but don't keep me too long from my <DAYNIGHTALL> chores.*/
@18 = ~NP: Where does the north road lead?~ /*Where does the west road lead?*/
@19 = ~Where does the east road lead?~
@20 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@21 = ~They moved in a few weeks ago and have been a terror ever since. My husband, Pete, he's too busy fretting about the cattle to sleep!~
@22 = ~Cattle cost money. How bad are the finances?~
@23 = ~Maybe I can help. Know anything else about it?~
@24 = ~NP: There are no more problems with wolves, they will no longer bother you.~ /*Very well, I will no longer travel in stealth mode.*/
@25 = ~A cult? Goodness me, what would you expect an old farmwife to know of that? We're good hard-working folk out here. No foolish cult would get far with us! Do you have more questions?~ /*A cult? Goodness me, what would you expect an old farmwife to know of that? We're good hard-working folk out here. No foolish cult would get far with us!*/
@26 = ~NP: What did you say about wolves?~ /*What you do, Fenthick?*/
@27 = ~Oh it's a small house sure enough, but it's home. Pete built it before we married and our darling Constance grew up in it and is with us still.~
@28 = ~How is Constance?~
@29 = ~What do you want to know?~
@30 = ~Pete says the big one, the she-wolf... her name is Silverback. He says he knows this 'cause... Oh I shouldn't say, you'll think him daft!~
@31 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@32 = ~A helpful hand is aways appreciated around here. You should talk to Pete. No doubt he's out there protecting the herd.~
@33 = ~NP: Tell me about wolves.~ /*Tell me about the docks.*/
@34 = ~Maybe by Ingo's place. His wife and I were so close before her passing. Something of him died with her, though. He's lost his spark. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*Maybe by Ingo's place. His wife and I were so close before her passing. Something of him died with her, though. He's lost his spark.*/
@35 = ~West? That's the road we take to Port Llast on market days. It's a long trip, though, and we usually spend the night with Pete's cousins in town.~
@36 = ~Ooh, the east road leads past Ingo's fields and into the Charwood. Just ask Ingo, it's not a place meant for the living to tread...~
@37 = ~We're all farmers here, not merchants or tradesfolk. Nearest shop's probably all the way back to Port Llast.~
@38 = ~NP: So it does not matter. For the most part, we have enough of our own supplies, but some things you can’t buy anywhere except in the city ... Well, for now we have enough cows, but I’m even afraid to think what will happen if the wolves cut everyone! We will be left with nothing!~ /*We still have enough of a herd to scrape by but imagine if the wolves had taken them all! We'd be left with nothing!*/
@39 = ~You'd best talk to my husband Pete. He's probably out watching the herd as we speak.~
@40 = ~NP: Oh thank you kind<RACE> , otherwise my husband has already completely worn out, guarding the herd. Now our life will return to its former track. Is there anything else you would like to ask?~ /*But we're getting off the topic. You were busy disapproving, as I recall. Something else you wanted, then, darling?*/
@41 = ~NP: So far, she's not smart enough for a woman... but she'll get better. She is a good girl. I used to be hot-tempered when I was younger too, you know... Was there anything else you wanted to know?~ /*Not wise enough to be a woman yet... but she'll get there. She means well enough. I was a young spitfire in my day too, you know...*/
@42 = ~Well he says he's heard her talking on the wind, telling stories to her cubs. A wolf who speaks Common... Pete's always had an imagination! If you ask me, he's just so caught up in protecting the herd that he's made the she-wolf into something more than she is. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*Pete's always had an imagination! If you ask me, he's just so caught up in protecting the herd that he's made the she-wolf into something more than she is.*/
@43 = ~You again, is it?~
@44 = ~Yes, I still have questions...~
@45 = ~Well, now, I don't have all day to be interrupted. There's bread in the oven, you know.~
@46 = ~NP: What an honor to have you in my house! Is there something you want to ask?~ /*Why fancy having a good <PRO_LADYLORD> like you in my own house!*/
@47 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
