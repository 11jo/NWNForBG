@0 = ~What, you trapped out here too? Ain't it just like the working stiffs to get the worst of everything. It's rough, isn't it. See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There's not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I'd be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.~ /*See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There's not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I'd be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.*/
@1 = ~Can't do squat with all the thieves everywhere. I don't know what's got into them, but it's made the Docks district unlivable. I can't go home for all the muggers.~
@2 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~Maybe somethings me can do?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Ah, I don't know anything you can't learn from better talkers than me. I ain't had time to see anything except them thieves nipping at my heels as I ran. I just want to get back to work, but until someone kicks some heads in the Docks district, I'm stuck out here. That's all there is to it.~ /*Ah, I don't know anything you can't learn from better talkers than me. I ain't had time to see anything except them thieves nipping at my heels as I ran.*/
@6 = ~I ain't looking for charity. I just want to be able to get back in the docks. Someone needs to get in there and raise hell. I swear, if my back was in better shape, I'd be in there, but I can't take on an army of thieves. No way.~ /*I ain't looking for charity. I just want to be able to get back in the docks. Someone needs to get in there and raise hell.*/
@7 = ~Bye then. Guess I'll just wait here. Nothing I can do. Why doesn't someone step up and be a damn hero?~
@8 = ~You one of those damned thieves? I wouldn't put it past them to come out here and start the same crap in the City Core that put me out of the Docks. See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There's not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I'd be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.~ /*See, I just want to go back to work in the Docks district. There's not much to do under the quarantine, but at least I'd be away from the stink of the corpse-fires.*/
@9 = ~I hate this. Someone should lay down the law.~
@10 = ~Glad that somebody was willing to take those thieves to the woodshed. I gotta thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get back to work in there.~
