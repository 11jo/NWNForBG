@0 = ~This better be good. I've got a fine drink going and that waitress is makin' eyes much prettier than yers.~ 
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose. Make it quick, though. I have ever so many places to be. Yeah, right.~
@4 = ~Where can I go to get some action?~
@5 = ~Aribeth tolerates mercenaries when Neverwinter has a standing militia?~
@6 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@7 = ~Get on, then. I've drinking to get to.~
@8 = ~But you know all this. I see you've got a pass for the Gauntlet in the Board Laid Bare tavern already. It's in the Blacklake district.~
@9 = ~Now, we speak the same language. There is one place... Hmm... Yes, you are good with weapons. Just don't talk about it. You don't need everyone to know. It's a club for fighting. We call it the Gauntlet. If you want action, that's where you go. I can sell you a pass, if you want. 250 gold.~ 
@10 = ~Here's my 50 gold.~
@11 = ~I don't have that much.~ 
@12 = ~No, thanks.~
@13 = ~Now, we speak the same language. There is one place... Hmm... I was gonna say the Gauntlet, but you got the fourth round medal on you right now! That's it for you, friend. You're at the top.~
@14 = ~I don't know. This place is pretty much just for weapon fighting. No fancy stuff, just straight out brawling.~
@15 = ~You can tell me. I'm up for it.~
@16 = ~Come now, there shouldn't be secrets among <RACE> kind.~
@17 = ~Tell me or I will get violent!~
@18 = ~Watch your mouth, friend. It hasn't gone unnoticed that when a few of the city guards died, she hired outsiders like you instead of coming here. Just because we work for the highest bidder, doesn't mean we wouldn't put it on the line for this city.~ 
@19 = ~I know a sword can't stop it, and that makes me worthless right now. No one is hiring, except the odd noble trying to prevent looting.~
@20 = ~And here's your pass. Don't say where you got it, although I doubt they'll ask. Nobody talks about the Gauntlet, but people show up anyway. The Board Laid Bare tavern is in the Blacklake district. Give the pass to the bartender. Good luck. You'll need it.~
@21 = ~No, it's better if I don't say anything. There's a rule about the Gauntlet. I forget what it is, though, because nobody talks about it.~
@22 = ~Would I be a mercenary if I scared that easy? Right. Just back away, friend. You don't want trouble here.~
@23 = ~Here there, friend. I suppose I got time to chat. Trade o' Blades ain't very busy today, and I'm gettin' nowhere with this waitress.~
@24 = ~What does you want, ha? Come on, you don't interrupt a Trade of Blades merc without good reason.~
