@0 = ~Ye may not be of me own clan, but yer a dwarf right enough - I figure ye must be all right. My name is Hodd, leader of me clan.~ [NWHOD055]
@1 = ~Is there somethin' I can help ye with?~
@2 = ~Why are the dryads at war with you?~
@3 = ~What do you make of this amulet?~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~All right dwarf. Now it's your turn to die.~ 
@6 = ~I think I will go now. Farewell.~
@7 = ~The leaf lovers canna' be reasoned with! They're mad, I tell ye! They attack us on sight, unleashing their fey magic upon me and me kin! And yet in me heart I wonder if the dryads are the only ones to blame. I don't speak of it with me kin but sometimes things are... strange. Like I be havin' a dream... or a nightmare.~ 
@8 = ~Aye, 'tis a pretty thing indeed. And it looks... familiar. As if it were known to me long ago. Ye see the fancy writin' on the back? An old and ancient tongue... yet I can figure out the words: "Tree and forge united, to overthrow the Master."~ 
@9 = ~So be it. The wisdom of me and my clan is yours for the takin', though I don't know much beyond this endless war with them damn immortal tree huggers!~
@10 = ~Immortal? What are you talking about?~
@11 = ~What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?~
@12 = ~Then ye'll taste me battle hammer before ye finish me off!~
@13 = ~Aye, and good luck to ye. Mind yerself as ye never know where the dryads might be lurkin'!~
@14 = ~In me visions I see dryads slain and their trees chopped down by me own kin's axes. Aye, 'tis enough to make me wonder if we dwarves have ever fallen under the same strange madness as the tree huggers.~
@15 = ~Have you always been at war with the dryads?~
@16 = ~This amulet was forged to hold great magic, but ye see how it be cracked now? Whatever magic it once had is long gone.~
@17 = ~Can you do anything to fix it?~
@18 = ~The amulet be repaired, right enough, and finely forged. But there be no magic in it save the magic of a great craftsman. Its original powers be no more.~
@19 = ~Can you make it magic?~
@20 = ~The amulet brings strange thoughts into me head. It... it stirs up dreams of ages past. Aye, I can see it now: a time when dryad and dwarf were allies against a brutal Master.~
@21 = ~Tell me more about this vision.~
@22 = ~Ye can never end a war when the dead keep coming back. The dryads are reborn after every death, just as me own kin come back time after time. The spells of the dryads have ended me own life too many times to count, yet every time I reappear here risen, healed and ready to battle and die all over again.~ 
@23 = ~That's horrible!~
@24 = ~You are immortal! You get to live forever.~
@25 = ~Snow globe? Ach, yer talking daft! The world is the world, right enough. There be nothing more to it than that. And the way of the world is war. A never-ending war with the tree huggers and their fell magic!~
@26 = ~Nay, I... I think once it were different, long ago... though it be hard to recall naught but bloodshed. Yet there be strange images hauntin' me dreams of dwarf and dryad standin' shoulder to shoulder. I see another time when my kin and the leaf lovers both served a terrible Master, slaves to a faceless shadow of evil.~ 
@27 = ~Aye, I suppose I could repair the crack. It be simple enough for me to cast a mending spell on it for ye. Stand back while I work me magic. There, the amulet be whole again, though it still be lacking the magic to make it a true artifact.~ 
@28 = ~Me clan know the secrets of magic, aye, but only the power of fire, forge, hammer and anvil. This amulet be forged to hold the power of tree and earth. The dryads have such power, right enough. They could craft it for ye. But the tree huggers be crazed. Ye be a fool if ye try to speak to them as they'll attack ye on sight. That be all I can tell ye about yer amulet, I'm afraid.~ 
@29 = ~I see a... beast. Cold as heartless winter. The Master. And I see... ach, 'tis all unclear... I see... the amulet. Aye, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to slay the Master and free us from this existence. Aye, now I recall! Dwarves and dryads united against a commmon foe and... nay, 'tis fading... the Master was too strong... the amulet cracked, its magic was lost and... and...~
@30 = ~Me kin be no cowards, but a never ending war be a terrible fate. The tortures and agonies of the dryad's magic be visited upon our souls with every death and rebirth. I canna' say how we came to be like this. This life be wrong and... unnatural, but we know no other way. War, death, rebirth... There be no escape for us.~ 
@31 = ~But the memories be dark as shadows in the heart of a mine. Maybe me thoughts is not even real. Aye, it truly seems my kin has always been at war with the dryads.~
@32 = ~Ach, the vision be gone. It as if some foul magic has plucked the very memories from me mind. I canna' even see the face of the Master anymore.~
@33 = ~Maybe I could free you from this Master.~
@34 = ~The only release we seek is death. Maybe, if ye could slay the Master my clan could find peace... but could be the Master already be dead. Even now I begin to forget... Nay, the magic is too strong. The memories yer amulet awoke in me mind be gone: the Master, the amulet... there is nothing left I can tell ye.~ 
@35 = ~Me name be Hodd, leader of this dwarven clan. We don't see yer kind 'round here much. But at least you ain't attackin' us on sight like them crazed dryads!~ [NWHOD056]
@36 = ~Aye, me an' me clan bid ye greetings once more.~ [NWHOD054]
