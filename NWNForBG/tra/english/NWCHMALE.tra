@0 = ~A well observed day to ye, friend. Charwood does not see many visitors of your refined appearance. Or at all, actually.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I will answer, though I find your words very... I guess I find your speech very modern. The Mayor would probably help you better than I.~
@4 = ~What can you tell me about Charwood?~
@5 = ~I seek the cult that prolonged the Neverwinter plague.~
@6 = ~NP: Maybe you've heard some strange rumors?~ /*Maybe you hear about odd stuff or rumors?*/
@7 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time... and another...~
@8 = ~Oh, I'm sure there is little that I could tell you. It's a simple place, really... It has too many stories as it is...~
@9 = ~Charwood seems pretty isolated. Who protects you?~
@10 = ~Who are the important people in town?~
@11 = ~Do you have shops? Merchants?~
@12 = ~NP: I don't know anything about it... Neverwinter, you say? It seems like just yesterday I was told that this elf, Halueth Never, founded it. I apologize, but I know nothing of any sect. We live a very secluded life... I mean, we prefer to be on our own.~ /*I'm sorry, I haven't heard of any cult. We are kept isolated... Well, what I mean to say is that we prefer to keep to ourselves.*/
@13 = ~Where are your guards? Perhaps they know?~
@14 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@15 = ~NP: We know nothing. News from outside can bring change, and here things must stay as they are or the end will come. Я... I can't talk about it. You should talk to Mayor Mobley. He'll listen to all your stories. You have so many. just like Quintus. It's things like this that bring about change.~ /*We don't hear of anything. Outside news could bring change, and things must stay like this or everything ends. I... I can't talk about this.*/
@16 = ~Where can I find the Mayor?~
@17 = ~Who is Quint?~
@18 = ~NP: Well, I think you're talking about Castle Jareg. Lords Carlat and Quintus Jareg founded this settlement, and rule it, making it safe for all of us. Please go tell your stories to the Mayor. There is no need to talk about what goes on in Jareg Castle. It could lead to change, and no one wants that here.~ /*Please, you should tell your story to the Mayor. What goes on in Castle Jhareg is not to be spoken of. It might bring change, and nobody wants that.*/
@19 = ~Are you afraid of the Lords Jhareg?~
@20 = ~Who's Karlat?~
@21 = ~Look, listening to people's stories is Mayor Mobley's job, now. He's got answers for every question... even the tricky ones that Quint likes to pose...~
@22 = ~Tell me more about Charwood.~
@23 = ~NP: Hmm? Oh, no. We don't have any trade. Very rarely, as a quid pro quo. No one here trades anything but stories, and even then.... That's too bad. look elsewhere. There's this market town, they built it nearby not too long ago..... Port Llast, I think?~ /*Hmm? Oh, no. No commerce at all, really. Just the occasional barter for service. No one trades anything here but stories and even then...*/
@24 = ~Just formed? Port Llast is years old.~
@25 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@26 = ~NP: We don't need guards... except the one standing at the castle gates, of course. The Jareg Lords keep us safe. We're all here because of the Jareg Lords. But you should not speak of Jareg affairs. It could cause change. It could bring about the end.~ /*The Lords Jhareg are why we are here. But you should not speak of Jhareg business. It might bring change. It might end things.*/
@27 = ~You should be talking to Mayor Mobley. I can't say any more. People tell too many stories. People want too many things. Like that Quint.~
@28 = ~What does the gate guard protect you from?~
@29 = ~Why, he's in the town hall, like he... like he always is... Never leaving... never living... just this endless sleep...~
@30 = ~NP: Don't talk to him! He's insane! He'll destroy everything, everything! And lock you in here like he's locked us all in here. He-- He-- Я... I'm sorry, but I don't remember what we talked about at all. Isn't that weird? I don't remember a thing.~ /*Do not speak of him! He's mad! He will destroy everything, everything! And he'll trap you here like all of us... He... He will...*/
@31 = ~You don't understand. The telling of tales will lead only to trouble - Just ask Quint! Please, go talk to Mayor Mobley.~
@32 = ~NP: Я... No, it was wrong. it was-- I don't know how long ago it was. It's not right. Wait... there was something. Stopped. frozen. It was a great story! Everything was going well until he brought it to an end..... and we all continued to live happily ever after... even after that... forever...~ /*Stopped... frozen... It was a good story! Everything was going well until he brought it to an end... we all continue to live happily ever after... forever...*/
@33 = ~The guard? At the castle gate? I... I don't remember... He's new here... Mayor Mobley hired him... He protects us from... from change...~
@34 = ~I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go off like that. I'm just confused. Anyway, I'm sure you'll find what you need in Port Llast.~
@35 = ~Hello there. I hope a good thought has brought you our way? Charwood has not seen a new face is a very long time.~
@36 = ~What you talking about? You just see me earlier.~
@37 = ~NP: I don't doubt myself. Until you and I got to talking, I'd never met a newcomer. There's no doubt about it. no doubt about it. Time flows slowly here. it's almost stopped. He stopped it. stopped death. But... But it was too late for the-- for the children.~ /*Time moves slowly here... almost stops... He stopped it... stopped all the dying... But... But it was too late for the... for the children...*/
@38 = ~I'm sorry... I lost my thoughts for a moment there. It's a pleasure to meet you.~
