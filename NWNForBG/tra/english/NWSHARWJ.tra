@3 = ~Talk? About what, <CHARNAME>?~
@4 = ~I'd like to know more about you.~
@5 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@6 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@7 = ~Do you have any advice you can give me about my mission?~
@8 = ~As you wish. We should probably continue with your mission in any case.~
@9 = ~You'd like to know more about me, would you? All right, <CHARNAME>, I'm game for a little chit-chat. I want to ask you something, first, however. Why are you on this mission of yours? Why work for Aribeth at all? Did she bat her pretty elven eyelashes at you, or is there some other force at work here that I'm unaware of?~ /*Why are you on this mission of yours? Why work for Aribeth at all? Did she bat her pretty elven eyelashes at you, or is there some other force at work here that I'm unaware of?*/
@10 = ~Why do you want to know? I asked first.~
@11 = ~I cannot idly stand by while people suffer and die.~
@12 = ~In times of darkness great heroes must do great deeds. It is how legends are forged.~
@13 = ~Aribeth has promised me gold and riches if I can help her in this.~
@14 = ~So you did. I expect to be answered first before I say anything. Does that bother you?~
@15 = ~I suppose that is a fair motivation. I feel the same, to tell the truth, although I desire more out of all this than just mere success.~
@16 = ~Now you are are talking my language, <CHARNAME>. Making a name for ourselves by doing great things is what being an adventurer is truly all about, isn't it?~
@17 = ~Is that all there is to it? Wealth and power? Are you sure? There are many other ways to become rich other than performing great deeds, you know. Surely you must have chosen this way for some reason.~
@18 = ~I desire fame above all else. I want to walk the path that others haven't, to make my own legend rather than recount others'. I want to be thrilled and awed by my life, and when I look back on it to regret nothing. This may seem shallow to you. I have my reasons, however, and I ask no one's approval. What do you think, then, <CHARNAME>? Do I have a chance at those things, traveling with you?~ /*I desire fame above all else. I want to walk the path that others haven't, to make my own legend rather than recount others'. I want to be thrilled and awed by my life, and when I look back on it to regret nothing.*/
@19 = ~Absolutely, Sharwyn. Stick with me and you'll be famous.~
@20 = ~Forget about that. We have more important matters to attend to.~
@21 = ~Who knows what might happen, Sharwyn?~
@22 = ~Promises, promises. I'll admit that there's something about your future that holds great possibility, however. We'll see where it leads.~
@23 = ~You are the one who asked, <CHARNAME>. No matter how you might disapprove of what I think, however, your mission holds great possibility for me.~
@24 = ~True enough. Adventure can lead to death or obscurity... one can never tell for sure.~
@25 = ~Far better to make the attempt, I think. Far better, even, to perform great deeds and remain unknown than to not even try at all. I know where the 'normal' path leads, believe me... the path of the expected, the path that everyone else wants you to lead. Down that path lies oblivion.~ /*I know where the 'normal' path leads, believe me... the path of the expected, the path that everyone else wants you to lead. Down that path lies oblivion.*/
@26 = ~Oblivion? What are you talking about?~
@27 = ~No need to be so melodramatic about it.~
@28 = ~I agree.~
@29 = ~Death, <CHARNAME>... or as good as it, anyway. There are many ways to die that don't leave a corpse.~
@30 = ~I do not exaggerate, <CHARNAME>. I know what I speak of well enough. There are many ways to die that don't leave a corpse... whether you agree with me or not.~
@31 = ~You do? Yes, I'd expect your life is just about as far from normal as one can walk, isn't it? You understand whereof I speak.~
@32 = ~If you wish, I'll tell you a tale, sometime... about my family, and how I became what I am today. You'll probably be bored to tears, as I'm certainly not the stuff of legends yet... but it's up to you.~ /*If you wish, I'll tell you a tale, sometime... about my family, and how I became what I am today.*/
@33 = ~Tell me now.~
@34 = ~Sure, another time.~
@35 = ~I don't want to hear your stories, I'm sure.~
@36 = ~No... I'm not in the mood to tell you that tale just yet. Of legends and fairy tales, certainly... but I only tell stories about myself when I'm ready. I'm sure there's plenty to keep us busy, correct? Lead on, <CHARNAME>.~ /*No... I'm not in the mood to tell you that tale just yet. Of legends and fairy tales, certainly... but I only tell stories about myself when I'm ready.*/
@37 = ~Fair enough. Let's get back to your escapade, shall we?~
@38 = ~Well, that's entirely up to you. We need not speak at all, if you don't wish to, correct?~
@39 = ~I suppose I did offer to tell you about my family, didn't I? Very well then, <CHARNAME>, I'll tell you. By my family, I actually mean my mother. She's the only true family I've ever known. I never met my father... he and my mother parted ways before I was born.~ /*By my family, I actually mean my mother. She's the only true family I've ever known. I never met my father... he and my mother parted ways before I was born.*/
@40 = ~Mother was an adventurer, you see... a mage, in fact, of some skill. This is what other people have told me, however, as Mother would never discuss it. She left that life behind, along with my father, to marry a man of wealth.~
@41 = ~Why would she do that?~
@42 = ~You don't sound as if you approve.~
@43 = ~She had sense, obviously.~
@44 = ~As I said, Mother wouldn't discuss it. She had far more important considerations, after all, than any adventuring 'nonsense'. My mother wanted wealth. She wanted to live a life of fine jewelry, of carriage rides and a fine mansion in Blacklake. Her husband was a means to an end. She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money. Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn't care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.~ /*She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money. Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn't care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.*/
@45 = ~Perhaps not now, but I didn't know any better then. My mother considered her past 'nonsense', as she had much more important things to think about. My mother wanted wealth. She wanted to live a life of fine jewelry, of carriage rides and a fine mansion in Blacklake. Her husband was a means to an end. She left behind her magic and, instead, spent her life spending money.

Far more money than my step-father could ever afford. She didn't care a whit for his complaints so long as he kept providing her coin.*/
@46 = ~Oh, yes, certainly she did. My mother was preoccupied with her common sense, and considered only one thing truly important. My mother wanted wealth.

@47 = ~When he died unexpectedly, she was devastated. Not because he was gone, but because he left behind a mountain of debts. She was terrified at the thought of being poor.~
@48 = ~What about you? Were you saddened by his death?~
@49 = ~She sounds like a terrible woman.~
@50 = ~So she returned to her magic?~
@51 = ~I never really knew him, to be honest. My mother kept me quite distant, shuttled from one private school to another. She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.~ /*She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.*/
@52 = ~Terrible? Maybe so. Once you've entered that life of luxury and idleness, however, it's hard to believe that anything exists outside of it. She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.~ /*She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.*/
@53 = ~Certainly not. My mother had left that behind, after all. Once you've lived a life of luxury, it is difficult to believe that anything exists beyond it anymore. She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.~ /*She formed a desperate plan. Although she rarely saw me when I was a child, now she had need of me... I was a comely young woman, and she would see me wed to a wealthy bachelor.*/
@54 = ~Not for my benefit, of course, but for her own. I was so meek and accustomed to being ruled by her, I couldn't even conceive of an objection. My mother had her eye on the young Lord Farthingdon. He would never stoop to marry poor nobility, however... not unless he desired me. I would have to seduce him.~ /*My mother had her eye on the young Lord Farthingdon. He would never stoop to marry poor nobility, however... not unless he desired me. I would have to seduce him.*/
@55 = ~I had intended to. I went to Lord Farthingdon's estate to attend a party being held in his honor, my mother meaning us to meet. When we arrived, I was awestruck at the size of the hall. There were so many people dancing I could barely take it all in... and the music was so beautiful. I stepped onto the floor and approached the man my mother pointed out. I was very nervous, but the man was handsome and kind and witty. I fell in love with him immediately.~ /*When we arrived, I was awestruck at the size of the hall. There were so many people dancing I could barely take it all in... and the music was so beautiful.*/
@56 = ~My mother grabbed me away from him angrily not long later. I had mistaken her directions... it was not Lord Farthingdon I had danced with, after all. It was far too late for my heart, however.~
@57 = ~You must have felt foolish.~
@58 = ~I take it your mother wasn't happy about that?~
@59 = ~Who was this man, then?~
@60 = ~My mother thought I should have, obviously. She scolded me soundly. I was in complete bliss, however. I couldn't stop thinking about that man.~
@61 = ~She was furious, naturally, since I never got to meet Lord Farthingdon. She was even worse when it was discovered who I had met.~
@62 = ~His name was Dannen... a penniless apprentice bard in the service of Lord Farthingdon. I was utterly in love with him. My mother told me to forget all about him. I couldn't, however, despite the possibility that we might lose everything.~ /*His name was Dannen... a penniless apprentice bard in the service of Lord Farthingdon. I was utterly in love with him.*/
@63 = ~That was selfish of you.~
@64 = ~Love can do that.~
@65 = ~Then what happened?~
@66 = ~You sound like my mother. Our fate rested on my shoulders, she said... it was all on me, and I had a duty to attend to.~
@67 = ~I was young and blind and hopeless. I fell for the first man who showed interest in me... not that my mother intended for that to stop us.~
@68 = ~I had a choice, obviously. Take the path I was expected to and seduce Lord Farthingdon. Or run off with the penniless bard. I should have done one or the other. As it turned out, I made a mess of everything. Being a young fool, I suppose that could be expected. I'll tell you what happened sometime later, perhaps. Let's just continue on with what you were doing, shall we?~ /*I had a choice, obviously. Take the path I was expected to and seduce Lord Farthingdon. Or run off with the penniless bard.*/
@69 = ~You want to hear the rest of the tale about my ill-fated affair, do you? I suppose there's no harm in it. I should have run off with Dannen... or turned him aside completely. I did neither, as I was unwilling to disobey my mother. Instead, I seduced Lord Farthingdon as she wished... and loved my bard in secret.~ /*I should have run off with Dannen... or turned him aside completely. I did neither, as I was unwilling to disobey my mother. Instead, I seduced Lord Farthingdon as she wished... and loved my bard in secret.*/
@70 = ~Dannen was kind to me. He enthralled me with his music and I adored him. Lord Farthingdon, on the other hand, was merely lustful and possessive... and my mother was overjoyed.~
@71 = ~This couldn't have gone on long.~
@72 = ~Why didn't you simply make a decision?~
@73 = ~People act like idiots when they're in love.~
@74 = ~No, that's true. These things are bound to come to a bad end, of course, and I wish I had known that. As the date of my marriage to Lord Farthingdon grew closer, he began to suspect that something was amiss. I spent far too much time away from him and in Dannen's arms. It was all my mother could do to convince him that I was true to his love... and it was she who finally discovered me in the arms of my bard.~ /*As the date of my marriage to Lord Farthingdon grew closer, he began to suspect that something was amiss. I spent far too much time away from him and in Dannen's arms.*/
@75 = ~So did she have Dannen killed?~
@76 = ~NP: Well, did you kill your mother?~ /*So you killed her?*/
@77 = ~An unpleasant scene, I would bet.~
@78 = ~It was easier by far to give everyone what they wished. Lord Farthingdon wished a wife, my mother wished me to get married, and Dannen loved me.

@79 = ~They do. In fact, I would be willing to wager that the most heinous crimes have been committed in the name of love.

@80 = ~She had the guards chase him away, but they weren't able to kill him. That didn't stop me from loving him, either. Mother turned on me then, and forbade me to see Dannen ever again. I was to marry Lord Farthingdon and that was all there was to it. I refused, at first. I loved Dannen and nothing else mattered. So she begged me... that proud woman got on her knees with tears in her eyes and begged me not to abandon her to poverty.~ /*I refused, at first. I loved Dannen and nothing else mattered. So she begged me... that proud woman got on her knees with tears in her eyes and begged me not to abandon her to poverty.*/
@81 = ~Of course not. She was still my mother, after all. She sent the guards after Dannen, but he escaped... and to her chagrin, I still loved him.

@83 = ~I could do as I was expected: save my mother and marry a man whom I did not love... or I could run off into the unknown with Dannen.~
@84 = ~You chose Dannen?~
@85 = ~You chose Lord Farthingdon?~
@86 = ~I struggled with the decision, for I had never had to make up my own mind... but the thought of that dreary life with Lord Farthingdon frightened me so. I chose Dannen. Lord Farthingdon was outraged. He tried to have Dannen and me executed, and we were forced to flee with not a copper between us.~ /*I struggled with the decision, for I had never had to make up my own mind... but the thought of that dreary life with Lord Farthingdon frightened me so. I chose Dannen.*/
@87 = ~My mother was crushed. She was turned out from noble society as she feared, and lost everything to repay my step-father's debt.~
@88 = ~What did you do then?~
@89 = ~How could you do that to your mother?~
@90 = ~You did the only thing you could.~
@91 = ~I fled from Neverwinter with Dannen and we traveled far, and he taught me how to become a bard in my own right. I did not return home for many years... until recently, in fact. It was an odd feeling to discover that Lord Farthingdon had lost his own fortune years ago and both he and his household were now dead from the plague. That was the fate that had awaited me. And my mother... I have only been to see her once since my return.~ /*It was an odd feeling to discover that Lord Farthingdon had lost his own fortune years ago and both he and his household were now dead from the plague.

@95 = ~She has lived all these years as a poor seamstress, it seems, bitter and blaming me for the poor luck which had befallen her. We said little to each other, as she ordered me out of her leaky cottage. I did find out one thing, however: she is dying.

@119 = ~Plenty. It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist than actually try to help.

We would camp off the roads and I would listen in awe as Dannen told me the old legends by the firelight.

@150 = ~Well... Dannen was positive that our long months of playing in taverns had caught someone's attention, that we were being rewarded. He was overjoyed. Myself, I was hesitant. I was not so sure of our abilities, so questioning the motives behind the invitation was far easier.~ /*Well... Dannen was positive that our long months of playing in taverns had caught someone's attention, that we were being rewarded. He was overjoyed.*/
@151 = ~I urged Dannen to ignore the invitation, but naturally he would have none of it. It was the beginning of the end for us, really, though I did not know it. Perhaps it is a story I shall tell you some time.~
@152 = ~No, tell me the rest now.~
@153 = ~I'll hold you to that promise.~
@154 = ~Why would I want to hear about your sad breakup with Dannen?~
@155 = ~No, I've had enough of that story for now. I'm not in the mood, <CHARNAME>. Come, let us adventure more. It will lift my spirits some, I think.~ /*No, I've had enough of that story for now. I'm not in the mood, <CHARNAME>.*/
@156 = ~I didn't promise anything. Perhaps I'll tell you about it... perhaps not. We shall see. Come, let us adventure more. It will lift my spirits some, I think.~ /*I didn't promise anything. Perhaps I'll tell you about it... perhaps not. We shall see.*/
@157 = ~The tale is a bit unusual... our love did not end in the usual way, I'd wager. Though you need not hear it at all, I care not. Come, let us adventure more. It will lift my spirits some, I think.~ /*The tale is a bit unusual... our love did not end in the usual way, I'd wager. Though you need not hear it at all, I care not.*/
@158 = ~Hmm... I had just mentioned the invitation from Athkatla, hadn't I? Yes, that's right. We went, though I had a sense of foreboding the entire way. The City of Coin lived up to its name. It was a golden, bustling place that rivalled even the great Waterdeep. The palace we arrived at was larger than any building I had ever seen.~ /*The City of Coin lived up to its name. It was a golden, bustling place that rivalled even the great Waterdeep. The palace we arrived at was larger than any building I had ever seen.*/
@159 = ~Dannen assured me that we would find our fortune there, and for a while I thought he might be right. We were to play before the fabulously wealthy Lord and Lady Onaris, and all seemed well.~
@160 = ~What went wrong, then?~
@161 = ~Athkatla is a dangerous place, I hear.~
@162 = ~How did this Lord and Lady even know of you?~
@163 = ~Nothing went wrong, at first. Dannen and I were pampered and prepared for our performance, and it went off without any problems. We sang in a great hall before several hundred nobles. It still takes my breath away to think about it... and the applause for our duet was thunderous. I remember being exhilarated and pleased, as Dannen was. It was then that the Lord and Lady Onaris came to greet us in person.~ /*We sang in a great hall before several hundred nobles. It still takes my breath away to think about it... and the applause for our duet was thunderous.*/
@164 = ~Perhaps, though we were nowhere near its worst sections. We were welcomed into a world of wealth and luxury, with everything we desired delivered by eager slaves.~
@165 = ~That was my question, certainly, and not one that anybody seemed able to answer. The slaves doted on us, yet simply stared blankly when asked anything.~
@166 = ~Lord Onaris was a fat and simple man who seemed bored. The Lady, however... she was an exotic beauty. Violet eyes, elfin features, an astounding gown; every man watched as she passed.~
@167 = ~Uh-oh, that does sound bad...~
@168 = ~Did you ask why they invited you?~
@169 = ~NP: You're not a hobgoblin either, Sherwin.~ /*You're not exactly a hobgoblin, Sharwyn.*/
@170 = ~I would have hoped not. I would have hoped that love meant something, but Dannen didn't fail to notice her charms, that was certain.~
@171 = ~Of course I asked why we were invited. Lady Onaris ignored me and fawned over Dannen, saying how she had spotted him in a lovely tavern in Beregost and had wanted to meet him. I had been in Beregost, too, of course... but I was completely ignored. She cooed over Dannen and he was flushed with pleasure at the attention. He agreed readily to a year-long contract to perform.~ /*Of course I asked why we were invited. Lady Onaris ignored me and fawned over Dannen, saying how she had spotted him in a lovely tavern in Beregost and had wanted to meet him.*/
@172 = ~Next to Lady Onaris, I might as well have been the homeliest hobgoblin you can imagine. She had a presence... and Dannen noticed it, too.~
@173 = ~Of course I was not happy about it. Dannen calmed me later and assured me there was nothing to worry about. Nothing could have been further from the truth.~
@174 = ~Oldest story in the book.~
@175 = ~He left you for the Lady, then?~
@176 = ~Why did you stand for it?~
@177 = ~Perhaps. Perhaps not. I fought for Dannen, but things weren't as they seemed. That is a tale I'll continue at another time, however. I tire of thinking about Dannen, <CHARNAME>. Let's do something else.~ /*That is a tale I'll continue at another time, however. I tire of thinking about Dannen, <CHARNAME>. Let's do something else.*/
@178 = ~Not right away. I fought for him... I thought our love would endure. Things weren't exactly as they seemed, however. That is a tale I'll continue at another time, however.

@180 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. I had already told you we'd met the Lady Onaris, correct? That she'd fawned all over Dannen, but he'd assured me there was nothing to fear? Well, we were bound by contract now to perform... so we did. We did so well, too. It was not long before we the toast of Athkatla, praised by the Lord and Lady Onaris at every turn.~ /*Well, we were bound by contract now to perform... so we did. We did so well, too. It was not long before we the toast of Athkatla, praised by the Lord and Lady Onaris at every turn.*/
@181 = ~Nobles showered us with attention and gifts at every turn. Everyone wanted us to perform for them next. I was a bit dazzled by it all... but also concerned. Lady Onaris continued to lavish attention on Dannen. She called him to private performances... without me... and he was spellbound, despite my efforts to distract him.~ /*Nobles showered us with attention and gifts at every turn. Everyone wanted us to perform for them next. I was a bit dazzled by it all... but also concerned.*/
@182 = ~Why didn't you leave him?~
@183 = ~Were they having an affair?~
@184 = ~You should have challenged her!~
@185 = ~Leave him? I couldn't conceive of such a thing. He was my world... and the longer I spent without him, the lonelier I felt. Desperate and angry, I accused Dannen of succumbing to her lust. He denied it, denied it angrily... and I believed him. Almost. After one of our largest concerts, I followed Dannen as he left the stage. I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.~ /*After one of our largest concerts, I followed Dannen as he left the stage. I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.*/
@186 = ~I prayed that it was not so. I suspected, but could prove nothing. The servants were too good at misdirecting me, subtly keeping me from interrupting their 'privacy'.

@187 = ~I couldn't even find them, to tell the truth. The palace was a maze, and the servants too adept at subtly keeping me from locating their mistress. I did try, futilely. Desperate and angry, I accused Dannen of succumbing to her lust. He denied it, denied it angrily... and I believed him. Almost.

I used what magic I knew to disguise myself, avoiding the servants and keeping pace with him.*/
@188 = ~I felt terribly guilty for the deception, hoping against hope that my suspicions were for naught. Of course I was disappointed. I watched invisibly as Dannen made his rendezvous with Lady Onaris, laying fevered kisses upon her and saying how every minute they were apart was excrutiating to him.~ /*I watched invisibly as Dannen made his rendezvous with Lady Onaris, laying fevered kisses upon her and saying how every minute they were apart was excrutiating to him.*/
@189 = ~I would have killed him, if I were you.~
@190 = ~You should have left.~
@191 = ~Why did they bother to keep it secret from you?~
@192 = ~It crossed my mind, as I stood there. I also thought of killing her. I also thought of killing myself. I was betrayed, bewildered and heart-broken all at once. In my shock, I must have dropped my spell, for the Lady Onaris spotted me. She did not care... she only laughed lightly and pointed me out to Dannen. He merely looked at me and smiled. I merely stood there dumbfounded as Dannen called me a foolish little girl. Pathetic, even. Not only did he prefer Lady Onaris... but he had *never* loved me.~ /*I merely stood there dumbfounded as Dannen called me a foolish little girl. Pathetic, even. Not only did he prefer Lady Onaris... but he had *never* loved me.*/
@193 = ~You are right. If I had had any sense, I would have left. I was young and in love, however... and that leaves no room for sense.

@194 = ~I fled, their mocking laughter ringing in my ears. I fled them, I fled Athkatla... and I have never been back.~
@195 = ~That's horrible, Sharwyn.~
@196 = ~You should have taken revenge. I would have.~
@197 = ~So he cheated on you. Why be so dramatic?~
@198 = ~I would never treat you like that, Sharwyn.~
@199 = ~Yes, I was devastated. I had left the security of my family to make Dannen my world, and it had crumbled around me. As I said, however, things were not as they seemed.~
@200 = ~I was young, a fool and in love. I should have known better, obviously. As I said, however, things were not as they seemed.~
@201 = ~Hah! Were I as cynical as I am now... or as you are... things would never have reached that point to begin with. I was a fool. As I said before, however, everything was not as it seemed.~
@202 = ~I... that is, I... th-thank you, <CHARNAME>. I don't know what to say. While your intentions are... are sweet, I doubt that would be the case. As I said, not everything was as it seemed.~ /*While your intentions are... are sweet, I doubt that would be the case. As I said, not everything was as it seemed.*/
@203 = ~I found out much later that Lady Onaris's beauty was the result of an enchantment... a glamer. She had spellbound Dannen in the literal sense. I have also discovered that a lock of nymph's hair will break her spell. Dannen will be released... and her glamour will end. She will revert to her natural appearance: old and fat, so I hear.~ /*I have also discovered that a lock of nymph's hair will break her spell. Dannen will be released... and her glamour will end. She will revert to her natural appearance: old and fat, so I hear.*/
@204 = ~Are you sure Dannen is still with her?~
@205 = ~Would you take him back, now that you know?~
@206 = ~What will that prove?~
@207 = ~Yes, so the story goes, at any rate. He has been a famous bard in Athkatla for years, and she is still his patron. A fairy tale that will end one day.~
@208 = ~No. The hurt was too real, even if the glamour wasn't. At some level, I would always blame him for... not being strong enough. It doesn't matter.~
@209 = ~Dannen wasn't strong enough to resist the spell... I will always blame him for that, a little. I would like to free him. Then he can decide for himself whether to stay with her... based on the truth, not an illusion.~
@210 = ~Everyone should be allowed their little illusions, perhaps. I admit that it would give me some small satisfaction to remove her spell once and for all. All it will take is finding that nymph's hair. One day, perhaps, I shall discover some.~ /*Everyone should be allowed their little illusions, perhaps. I admit that it would give me some small satisfaction to remove her spell once and for all.*/
@211 = ~I believe I have a lock of nymph's hair, here.~
@212 = ~We'll find you some nymph's hair, Sharwyn.~
@213 = ~Just don't get preoccupied with it.~
@214 = ~Are you sure revenge will be so satisfying?~
@215 = ~That is nymph's hair isn't it? You are a marvel, <CHARNAME>. Dannen will be freed and Lady Onaris revealed for the fat old woman she is. Or is that what I want? I have been looking forward to this for some time, but I fail to feel any excitement over it.~ /*That is nymph's hair isn't it? You are a marvel, <CHARNAME>. Dannen will be freed and Lady Onaris revealed for the fat old woman she is.*/
@216 = ~Perhaps you should just let it be, then.~
@217 = ~Dannen should be free from the spell, at least, no?~
@218 = ~Lady Onaris hurt you. She deserves to be revealed for what she is.~
@219 = ~You don't need Dannen anymore, I guess.~
@220 = ~I believe you, <CHARNAME>. It doesn't matter... we have more important things to do, here.~

I can think of a few places where chances might be greater of finding them, however.*/

@235 = ~That's enough information for now.~

At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.

One, of course, is Hanali Celanil... goddess of love and the gold elves. One is Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of the sky and the winged avariel. The third is Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of dreams and the moon elves. Tamorlyn readily agreed to perform the tasks, of course. That, however, I'll tell you another time... seeing as you interrupted and all.~ /*One, of course, is Hanali Celanil... goddess of love and the gold elves. One is Aerdrie Faenya, goddess of the sky and the winged avariel. The third is Sehanine Moonbow, goddess of dreams and the moon elves.*/
@278 = ~Oh, come on! Tell me now!~
@279 = ~NP: Okay, let's go.~ /*Is okay, I guess.*/
@280 = ~Ha ha! To be honest, <CHARNAME>, I've forgotten how part of the story goes. Let's just keep moving... I'll remember the rest eventually.~
@281 = ~Good enough. I can tell the rest of the tale when we get a chance, later.~
@282 = ~Fair enough. I think I remember how the rest of it goes, now. I told you that Tamorlyn had agreed to do a task for each of the Triune, correct? The first task was for Aerdrie Faenya. He was to retrieve the feather of the largest phoenix to fly the skies of the deep southern lands. For many long years Tamorlyn would scour the highest peaks of Turmish and Chondath, following the legends of the great birds, yet never spotting them.~ /*Fair enough. I think I remember how the rest of it goes, now. I told you that Tamorlyn had agreed to do a task for each of the Triune, correct?*/
@283 = ~A century of harship would pass before finally Tamorlyn would return to that northern mountain, ragged but triumphantly holding the pinion feather of a great phoenix. For Sehanine Moonbow he would seek out remnants of each of our three moons that had fallen to the ground in a blaze of fire. Another century he would spend in search of them... long-buried, long-forgotten and scattered. Finally, with tears in his eyes, he returned with the three rock shards in his hands.~ /*Another century he would spend in search of them... long-buried, long-forgotten and scattered. Finally, with tears in his eyes, he returned with the three rock shards in his hands.*/
@284 = ~For Hanali Celanil he would seek the golden heart of a dragon dead of simple age... one of the rarest things someone could seek. He wailed at the thought but was determined. For centuries he wandered, following rumor after rumor, until finally he came into the northern lands when he heard of a wizened wyrm breathing his last. Tamorlyn spent many years finding the creature and then befriending him, singing to the aged dragon as he weakened slowly through the decades.~ /*For Hanali Celanil he would seek the golden heart of a dragon dead of simple age... one of the rarest things someone could seek. He wailed at the thought but was determined.*/
@285 = ~When at last the great beast passed, Tamorlyn was saddened... but also overjoyed that at last his quest was at an end. Before Tamorlyn could return to the goddess, however, he was found by one of his own people. He was told the sad news that his beloved wife and children had died of a terrible illness during his absence. Torn by the news, Tamorlyn wept and railed with anger at the goddess who had kept him from his family for so long. She did not answer.~ /*Before Tamorlyn could return to the goddess, however, he was found by one of his own people. He was told the sad news that his beloved wife and children had died of a terrible illness during his absence.*/
@286 = ~Tamorlyn poured his grief and his pain and his loss into a song. Since he could not sing of love, he would sing of this... sing of all that he had missed. And this is what he sang to the goddess. And finally Hanali Celanil came, with tears flowing from her golden eyes. "You understand at last the meaning of love, child," she said. "As I promised, you shall be rewarded." With that, she lifted Tamorlyn up through the gates of Arvandor to join his wife and children, to spend eternity with them in paradise. And that is the end.~ /*And finally Hanali Celanil came, with tears flowing from her golden eyes. "You understand at last the meaning of love, child," she said. "As I promised, you shall be rewarded."*/
@287 = ~That is a beautiful story...~
@288 = ~What? She killed him? That is utter crap.~
@289 = ~Do you believe that about love?~
@290 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I'm glad you enjoyed it.~
@291 = ~Why did you tell me that story, by the way?~
@292 = ~You don't think it's true, do you?~
@293 = ~There's always a critic, isn't there? I'm surprised you could sit through the whole thing... if you even listened to it all.~
@294 = ~I... I don't know. I think love is different for everyone. You have to decide for yourself what you love most, what it means to you.~
@295 = ~What about you?~
@296 = ~Well... I don't know how much of that legend might be true, but I know there's some truth to it. There really was an elven bard named Tamorlyn... and he really did die in this region. Supposedly, he actually did write a song before he died... or so the rumors say. He was one of the greatest bards that ever lived, that song would have to be a masterpiece.~ /*Well... I don't know how much of that legend might be true, but I know there's some truth to it. There really was an elven bard named Tamorlyn... and he really did die in this region.*/
@297 = ~I don't know, <CHARNAME>. To tell it true, I don't know. Love and I... have never gotten along very well. Maybe in the future, who knows? But I don't want to think about that just yet. I hope you understand.~ /*Maybe in the future, who knows? But I don't want to think about that just yet. I hope you understand.*/
@298 = ~To get my hands on it... to have a chance to sing it, to bring it to the world. That would be everything, <CHARNAME>.~
@299 = ~What about this? Is this the song you're talking about?~
@300 = ~Maybe we'll find it. Who knows?~
@301 = ~It's probably just a myth, Sharwyn.~
@302 = ~It... it's written in elven, and... and the notes are... oh my! That... that's Tamorlyn's signature! This is it, this is it, <CHARNAME>! How did you ever find it?! It... it's lovely. He truly was a master. I... I almost thought it was a fairy tale, that it couldn't be true, but it is, isn't it?~ /*It... it's written in elven, and... and the notes are... oh my! That... that's Tamorlyn's signature! This is it, this is it, <CHARNAME>! How did you ever find it?!*/
@303 = ~What are you going to do with it?~
@304 = ~Sometimes even fairy tales are true, I guess.~
@305 = ~It's just a song, Sharwyn.~
@306 = ~That's true. Who knows if it would still be in good condition, even... but I can always dream. That's what being a bard is all about.~
@307 = ~You're probably right. I won't keep my hopes up, but you never know.~
@308 = ~I'm not sure. I want to sing it... I want to spread it just like Tamorlyn intended it to be, I think. Perhaps I'll sing it to the elves, first, who knows? I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>. I... I hope my friendship will be enough...~ /*I'm not sure. I want to sing it... I want to spread it just like Tamorlyn intended it to be, I think. Perhaps I'll sing it to the elves, first, who knows?*/
@309 = ~Your friendship is repayment enough, Sharwyn.~
@310 = ~Sounds like I'm getting the short end of the deal.~
@311 = ~You're not going anywhere, are you?~
@312 = ~I was hoping for something more than friendship...~
@313 = ~Yes, I suppose sometimes they are. Oh... I can't wait to sing this to a proper audience, to spread it just as Tamorlyn intended it to be. I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>. I... I hope my friendship will be enough...~ /*Yes, I suppose sometimes they are. Oh... I can't wait to sing this to a proper audience, to spread it just as Tamorlyn intended it to be.*/
@314 = ~It's not just a song, <CHARNAME>. It's much more than that! I can't wait to sing it... to spread it's word just as Tamorlyn intended. I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>. I... I hope my friendship will be enough...~ /*I'm not sure how I can ever repay you for this gift, <CHARNAME>. I... I hope my friendship will be enough...*/
@315 = ~NP: Thank you,<CHARNAME> . Know that I'm not going to run from you... the song can wait. Your mission is more important. Let's go and get it over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I want you to know that I've no intention of running out on you... the song can wait. Your mission comes first.*/
@316 = ~NP: Then I will repay you otherwise<CHARNAME> . I'm not going anywhere... I'll help you until the very end, I promise. Let's go and get this over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*Then I'll repay you some other way, <CHARNAME>. I'm not going anywhere... I'll continue to help you to the end, I promise.*/
@317 = ~NP: No, of course not. The song will wait... I will help you complete your task until the very end, I promise. Let's go and get it over with, find the Words of Power. We are waiting for the epilogue of your beautiful story, and accept this belt from me.~ /*No, of course not. The song can wait... I'll help you in your mission until the end, I promise.*/
@318 = ~You do? I... I would like that, <CHARNAME>. I know there are more important things to do right now, but once this is all over... I'd like that very much. The song can wait... I'll stand by your side until this is over, and once it is... well, we'll see what happens then. I do adore you, <CHARNAME>... I want you to know that. Let's go and end this, then, and find your Words of Power. The end of our great tale awaits us!~ /*The song can wait... I'll stand by your side until this is over, and once it is... well, we'll see what happens then. I do adore you, <CHARNAME>... I want you to know that.*/
@319 = ~My tale's done, <CHARNAME>. As I said, though, there's supposedly some truth to it... wouldn't it be wonderful to actually find Tamorlyn's lost song?~
@320 = ~Perhaps later, <CHARNAME>, but now isn't the time. We must hurry if we're to find the Words of Power.~
@321 = ~All I can really offer, <CHARNAME>, is an old legend I heard once a long time ago. South of Fort Ilkard there's supposed to be some ancient ruins... older than any settlement in the northlands by far, so the tales say. It was supposedly once the home of a 'creator race' that predates even the elves, if you can imagine that. I've never heard of anyone returning from it, though, so it could be anything.~ /*It was supposedly once the home of a 'creator race' that predates even the elves, if you can imagine that. I've never heard of anyone returning from it, though, so it could be anything.*/
@322 = ~Do you know any more about it?~
@323 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@324 = ~Well, the magic power in the area is supposed to be incredible. There are stone monoliths which are too dangerous even to approach. That's all unreliable information, however, I know. The only way to tell for sure would be to investigate.~ /*Well, the magic power in the area is supposed to be incredible. There are stone monoliths which are too dangerous even to approach.*/
@325 = ~So the end draws near, does it? I suppose all tales must end sooner or later. Any regrets, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWSHARSY]
@326 = ~A few, perhaps.~
@327 = ~No. No regrets.~
@328 = ~I regret we've never kissed. Does that count?~
@329 = ~Only that I brought your loud mouth along.~
@330 = ~Truly? Perhaps you will forget them once this is finally over. All of Faerun will celebrate you as a true hero after this. You know that, don't you?~
@331 = ~I'm doing this because it's right, not to be a hero.~
@332 = ~Don't be a fool. I do this because the money is good.~
@333 = ~Nothing wrong with being a hero, I suppose.~
@334 = ~I won't be the only hero, Sharwyn.~
@335 = ~I didn't think so. After all... when this is finally over all of Faerun will celebrate you as a true hero. You know that, don't you?~
@336 = ~I don't know. Maybe. I suspect I could be talked into it... especially since both our deaths could literally be around the next corner.~
@337 = ~Hah! Say what you like, <CHARNAME>... my own legend is being written right alongside yours, whether you like it or not. I'm glad to play my part. But I needn't speak more and ruffle your feathers. Let's finish this tale as it should be finished. Shall we?~ /*Hah! Say what you like, <CHARNAME>... my own legend is being written right alongside yours, whether you like it or not. I'm glad to play my part.*/
@338 = ~You know, that's what I like about you. I'll have to make sure your tale is penned properly. I'm sure I won't be the only bard eager to write of your legend.~
@339 = ~I'll just be happy if things go back to normal after this.~
@340 = ~I don't think I'm a legend...~
@341 = ~They can write what they like, so long as I get the royalties.~
@342 = ~Bah. It's a foolish business.~
@343 = ~I didn't suggest that all heroes are altruistic paladins... but that's how they end up somehow, isn't it? I wonder how bards will write your legend?~
@344 = ~Indeed. You will have earned your place, I think. They will be writing of your legend for an age to come, <CHARNAME>.~
@345 = ~That's kind of you to say, <CHARNAME>. Regardless, you will be the one the bards write of when they tell your legend.~
@346 = ~I doubt things will ever be truly normal for you again, <CHARNAME>. I envy you. As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky. Of course... that doesn't mean we need part ways, necessarily. I've grown rather fond of our pairing. I'd enjoy continuing our travels, if you would.~ /*As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky.*/
@347 = ~So would I, Sharwyn.~
@348 = ~Who knows what will happen?~
@349 = ~Ha! You're on your own after this.~
@350 = ~Aren't you being a bit premature?~
@351 = ~NP: Ha! You can deny if you want<CHARNAME> but your fate is predetermined. I doubt that anything can return to normal for you now,<CHARNAME> . I envy you. As for me... I should probably thank you for getting me this far. If I survive, perhaps in the future I will be able to find my great adventure. If I'm lucky. Of course... that doesn't mean we have to break up. I really like our union. I would love to continue traveling with you, if you don't mind.~ /*As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky.*/
@352 = ~Well said. I'll have to remember to quote you on that one. As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky. Of course... that doesn't mean we need part ways, necessarily. I've grown rather fond of our pairing. I'd enjoy continuing our travels, if you would.~ /*As for me... I suppose I've you to thank for taking me this far. If I live, I think I'll have my own great tale to find in the years to come. If I'm lucky.*/
@353 = ~Good. Of course... we've one tale to finish, first, before we start writing the next, don't we? Lead away, then, <CHARNAME>... let's finish this like it was meant to be.~ /*Good. Of course... we've one tale to finish, first, before we start writing the next, don't we?*/
@354 = ~True enough. I suppose we've one tale to finish, first, before I start writing the next, anyway. Lead away, then, <CHARNAME>... let's finish this like it was meant to be.~ /*True enough. I suppose we've one tale to finish, first, before I start writing the next, anyway.*/
@355 = ~I suppose that's how it has to be. Too bad. At any rate... we've one tale to finish before I go writing the next. Lead away, then, <CHARNAME>... let's finish this like it was meant to be.~ /*I suppose that's how it has to be. Too bad. At any rate... we've one tale to finish before I go writing the next.*/
@356 = ~It's not as if you'll be lacking for company should we succeed, <CHARNAME>. You'll be a hero throughout Faerun with women falling at your feet. You know that, don't you?~
