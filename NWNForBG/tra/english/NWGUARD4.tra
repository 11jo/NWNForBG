@0 = ~Hail, good <SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Docks have always been dangerous but now we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders. I assume you have proper quarantine clearance to enter the District? I don't wish to delay you amidst the stink of the corpse-fires any longer than I have to.~ 
@1 = ~Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.~
@2 = ~What kind of clearance do I need?~
@3 = ~Why do I need clearance?~
@4 = ~Sorry, no.~
@5 = ~Aye, there was word she'd be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?~
@6 = ~Could you answer some questions about the Docks district?~
@7 = ~I've got some general questions that need answers...~
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~We're under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you'll have to remain in the Core.~
@10 = ~Look, the Wailing Death isn't a joke. I don't even want to think of the number of dead. I heard Lord Nasher has even come down with it. We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.~ 
@11 = ~Then don't waste my time.~
@12 = ~I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.~
@13 = ~Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~What do you know of the Wailing Death?~
@15 = ~Are you familiar with Lady Aribeth?~
@16 = ~Be careful. There's plenty of danger afoot.~
@17 = ~Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages. He had the symbol of Helm, god of all us guard-folk, gripped tightly in his frozen palm. We buried him with it that way... to honor him.~ 
@18 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@19 = ~Do you know anything else about what happened that night?~
@20 = ~Too little to cure it, too much to live without fear. Our only hope is to find those Waterdhavian creatures. Without them, every last one of us is dead.~
@21 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?~
@22 = ~I'm interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.~
@23 = ~Can't say I know her as well as Abbot Fenthick, har har! But, aye, she has been a pillar of this community since she was knighted.~
@24 = ~Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?~
@25 = ~Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?~
@26 = ~The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@27 = ~I have some questions about the Docks district.~ 
@28 = ~The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@29 = ~You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@30 = ~Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@31 = ~If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know... Might there be something else you need?~ 
@32 = ~I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@33 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
@34 = ~Is there any way I can help out in there?~
@35 = ~How bad is it in there?~
@36 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Docks district?~
@37 = ~Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?~
@38 = ~I don't know if there's much left to do. There was some trouble with a pirate group, but that's all over with. It's quiet now.~
@39 = ~Well, you can report in to the Gate Guard on the other side. Maybe he'll know something about the... uh, I probably shouldn't be talking about that.~
@40 = ~Look, I'm here to help, remember?~
@41 = ~Actually, it's pretty quiet now. There was some trouble with the Bloodsailors, but that's all over with. I don't know much about what happened, but it's done. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ 
@42 = ~It's pretty bad - I certainly wouldn't go in unequipped. I'd hide any valuables if I were you, too. In fact, it's safe to say the criminals have all but taken over the entire district. We guards do our best, but we just don't have the numbers.~
@43 = ~Well, the biggest landmark is the Seedy Tavern up against the north wall, run by old Jim Seedy. The Golden Apple Inn is a little southwest of it. If it's a store you're looking for, mind you, Twenty-in-a-Quiver is the best the district's got and it's just a little southeast of ol' Seedy. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ 
@44 = ~I suppose you're right... Apparently there's been increasing activity from the Bloodsailors, a local pirate's guild. What they're up to is anybody's guess but it's something big... If you want to know more about it, I suggest you talk to the Dockside Gate Guard. He'll have the latest information, whatever it may be. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ 
@45 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Peninsula district?~
@46 = ~Hail, good <SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Peninsula is a dangerous place and we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders, but you may pass.~
@47 = ~Hail, good <SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Peninsula was a dangerous area, but now there is nothing to do there. The jailbreak is already sorted out, as far as I know.~
