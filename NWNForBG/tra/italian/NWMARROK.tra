@0 = ~Well now, you might know your way around a fine weapon or two, eh? What can Marrok do for you?~
@1 = ~What exactly is it you do here?~
@2 = ~I want you to make an item for me.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~I'm a weapon and armor smith, of sorts. I take component items and combine them with magic items to make even more powerful magic items. Not a bad little gig, if you can get it.~
@5 = ~What kinds of things would 'component' items be?~
@6 = ~I'm not interested right now.~
@7 = ~Okay, I see there's some stuff on my anvil. Let me take a look and see what I can construct for you.~
@8 = ~Just place one component item and one magical weapon or one suit of magic armor on the forge and I'll help you out. But if the forge isn't full - like now - I can't really do my thing, can I?~
@9 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time.~
@10 = ~Well, I need stuff like Adamantine and Ironwood and Ritellium and Dragon Blood and Fairy Dust (SPIT!!) and Holy Water and Gargoyle Skulls and... and... Adamantine... Then I take a magic version of the item you want made, and combine the things to make something different.~
@11 = ~Do you have examples? Give me some idea of what you need.~
@12 = ~Where can I get some of these components?~
@13 = ~Is the item guaranteed to be powerful?~
@14 = ~Hey, I'm not trying to pressure you. I've got enough business as it is. Anything else I can do for you?~
@15 = ~Look, you've already got a copy of my recipe book, so what more do you want? Just read the damn thing.~
@16 = ~Eh, I suppose. I don't like tipping my hand all that much, but I can't sell it if you don't know about it. Here, take a copy of this book. It's got all you need to know.~
@17 = ~That ain't my concern. If you're the adventuring sort, you can go try and take them from monsters. I think you can get some from merchants, though.~
@18 = ~Eh, no. See, If your weapon or armor is really powerful already, you should keep it. Just give me your low-level magic items. I can't guarantee that your fancy item won't get worse.~
@19 = ~Let's see... you have a ritellium and a suit of magical armor. I could build you a Chromatic Armor - a fine suit of armor if I do say so myself. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 7000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~
@20 = ~Here is your 7000 gold.~
@21 = ~I cannot afford this item.~
@22 = ~Nevermind, I don't want you to make the item.~
@23 = ~What is that? Some special holy water? Powerful stuff. I could combine it with your suit of magical armor and make you a Scales of Truth suit. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~
@24 = ~Here is your 6000 gold.~ 
@25 = ~Hmmm... I could combine that gargoyle skull and your suit of magical armor into a top of the line suit of Whitebone Armor. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 5000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@26 = ~Here is your 5000 gold.~ 
@27 = ~That adamantite could be worked into that magic battleaxe to make a Sentinel. Fine weapon. Mighty fine weapon. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 5500 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@28 = ~Here is your 5500 gold.~ 
@29 = ~This will work. I can combine your adamantite with your magic halberd to make a Stonefire Great Axe. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~
@30 = ~Dragon blood is powerful stuff. If I remember right I could combine it with that magic hand axe and make an Dragon Horror Axe. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 8000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~
@31 = ~Here is your 8000 gold.~

@33 = ~Here is your 4000 gold.~ 
@34 = ~Interesting. Ironwood would graft quite nicely to that magical mace to make a solid Ironwood Mace. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 5000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@35 = ~You know, that ritellium could be added to your magic light hammer to make a Storm Hammer. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 7000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~
@36 = ~I could work that ironwood into your magic flail to make a Foundation Flail. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~
@37 = ~Aha - jackpot! I can use your special holy water and your magic mace to create a Mace of Disruption! But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@38 = ~Look at that - fairy dust! I could combine it with your magic morning star to construct a Drone Morning Star. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6500 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@39 = ~Here is your 6500 gold.~ 
@40 = ~Okay - I can take your adamantite and your magic war hammer make you a Rune Hammer. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6500 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@41 = ~Ah... there's real potential here. Your adamantite and your magic greatsword will make a Harbinger Kin Greatsword. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@42 = ~Okay, here's something. I can use your adamantite and your magic katana to make a Sword Saint Katana. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~

@47 = ~Huh. Dragon blood. Not going to ask where you got that, but I can use it to turn that magic halberd into a Ravager Halberd. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 5500 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@48 = ~Hmmm... that fairy dust will work into your magic spear. I could make a Fey Spear, if you want. But this job isn't cheap. It will cost 6000 gold pieces for me to make this for you. Payment in advance, of course.~ 
@49 = ~Always a pleasure doing business with a fine <MANWOMAN> such as yourself. Stand back - you don't want to catch a hammer in the head.~
@50 = ~Fair enough - but this isn't a charity I'm running. If you don't have the gold, you don't get the item.~ 
@51 = ~Fair enough - a customer always has the right to change <HISHER> mind.~
@52 = ~There you go, <SIRMAAM>. Quick as you please and the job is done. You can pick the item up from my forge.~
@53 = ~By the hells, Durga be letting the worst rabble in here! What you want from Marrok, what, what!?~
@54 = ~No, no, no, you sneak in here! You are no fighter type, I can see that plain! Get you gone from here! MY WORK IS NOT FOR AMATEURS!~
