@0 = ~Greetings, and welcome to this small house of Helm. Do you seek a blessing in this troubled time?~
@1 = ~I welcome the offer, thank you.~
@2 = ~NP: Bless, but I doubt it will be of any use.~ /*Go ahead, though I doubt it shall do any good.*/
@3 = ~You will forgive me if I do not indulge, thank you.~
@4 = ~I am not interested in your hollow blessings.~
@5 = ~Can you offer basic temple services?~
@6 = ~NP: This is a balm for the soul. You will feel the goodness of it, as will any thirsty heart, I assure you. Now tell me what really brought you here? I feel a heavy burden on your soul.~ /*And now, what has truly brought you to this place? You have a great weight upon you.*/
@7 = ~Do you know who is creating the zombies?~
@8 = ~Will people be safe if I bring them here?~
@9 = ~Have your blessings had an effect on the progress of the plague?~
@10 = ~Goodbye.~
@11 = ~No, I can see that you are possessed of another purpose. What can I do for you?~
@12 = ~I have temple services, if you require.~
@13 = ~NP: From what I understand, this is one of Waterdeep's creations... yan-ti. Such terrible creatures. I cannot say why it did so. Ultimately, it doesn't matter. She's dead and the zombies don't threaten anyone anymore. Of course, people will still come here. The plague is not yet over.~ /*Ultimately, it doesn't matter. She is dead and the zombie threat is over. Of course, people should still come here. The plague still rages.*/
@14 = ~NP: Zombie? I know little besides the fact that their heinous attacks on the city destroy the hope of all the inhabitants of Neverwinter. However, if you find the culprit, tell him that he helped the city, even if he wanted to destroy it.~ /*The zombies? I know little except that their disrespectful attack upon the city degrades the hopes of all Neverwintans.*/
@15 = ~NP: Well, as far as I understand, the Beggar's Nest is no longer threatened by the undead, so you can safely go outside. Of course, I still salute anyone who yearns to know Helm's word. The plague still threatens us. We are far from safe.~ /*Of course, I still welcome all that would seek the word of Helm. The plague still rages. We are far from true safety.*/
@16 = ~NP: Absolutely. This is a refuge from the undead. They cannot enter here because of the good power of my blessings. I personally see to the safety of all who come here and serve everyone without distinction. We care about everyone equally.~ /*I will see to the safety of all who enter, and will administer to them indiscriminately. All will be treated equally.*/
@17 = ~Is this the only haven? People could fortify elsewhere.~
@18 = ~NP: Not yet, but hope is strong. Each blessing relieves the soul, even if it cannot prevent the destruction of the body. The Great Cemetery is now literally everywhere, but we do not give up. Hope will save this city. You will see.~ /*Not as yet, but hope is powerful. Each blessing eases the mind, even if unable to prevent destruction of the body.*/
@19 = ~As you will, but these doors are open should you need. All are welcome to receive the blessing.~
@20 = ~NP: ABOUT! I offer hope. Some prefer to crowd into the vile Silver Serpent Inn, but I can't call that place a safe haven. Only here can people receive the necessary blessings. Only here we understand that there is a plague.~ /*Bah! I offer hope. Some huddle in the filth of the Silver Serpent tavern, but that doesn't make it a sanctuary.*/
@21 = ~More have come seeking shelter, I see. Do you wish to receive the blessing I offer?~
