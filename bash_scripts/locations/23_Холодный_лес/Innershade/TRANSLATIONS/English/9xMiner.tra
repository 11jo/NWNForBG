@0    = ~Are you new to the Innershade? Well, if you're looking for a job, sorry, but the mines are closed because of the events that happened some time ago. You should ask Strongheart, or someone else. Maybe Eva, the blacksmith, can find some work for you.~
@1    = ~I'm not some kind of new villager or anything, but would you elaborate about these 'events' you mentioned?~
@2    = ~I'm not looking for just any work. I'm looking for a trade. Are there any in this village?~
@3    = ~Who are you?~
@4    = ~My mistake. I will leave now. Bye!~
@5    = ~Ah, it's you again. Sorry, I didn't notice you. I was doing some push-ups to stay in good condition, since I work in the mines... which are forbidden by Patric for now. You know... the 'events' that happened... Anyway, may I help you?~
@6    = ~Yes, you may. Tell me something about those 'events' you mentioned.~
@7    = ~Probably. I'm looking for merchants. Are there any in this village?~
@8    = ~Just a question: who are you?~
@9    = ~No. Goodbye.~
@10   = ~You see, I'm not sure if I should. However, I'll tell you what you can do.~
@11   = ~Go to Patric the Dawnmaster. He is a kind of guardian, or mayor, of the Innershade. He'll be able to tell you some details. You'll find him in a narrow tower southwest of my house. Do you have any other questions?~
@12   = ~Do you think this Patric could find some kind of work for me?~
@13   = ~Yes. I'm looking for merchants. Are there any in this village?~
@14   = ~Indeed. Who are you?~
@15   = ~I see... I'll leave now. Bye!~
@16   = ~Yes. Talk to Eva, but watch out: she's a bit of a moody person. Especially when she's talking with a man. I'll never forget when she kicked me in my crotch, and my wife thought that I was cheating on her, since my... injury forced me into a little rest from making love. Watch out. She's unpredictable. You'll find her home to the west of here.~
@17   = ~Thanks. Who are you, by the way?~
@18   = ~Ok, I'm leaving, then.~
@19   = ~What did you say about those 'events' that happened lately? Tell me.~
@20   = ~I am Chardon and I'm the main miner of Innershade. Well, now I'm the only one, because of those damned things that happened.~
@21   = ~Mhm. I'm looking for merchants. Are there any in this village?~
@22   = ~I see. I have to go.~
@23   = ~What happened lately? Tell me something. I may be be able to help.~
@24   = ~Good <DAYNIGHT> to you, then!~
@25   = ~Maybe. If you're an adventurer, maybe you'll be able to help with the mines, but it may be something serious. People died. Now that must be something. Before you decide to help, think about it carefully. You may well become the next victim.~
@26   = ~I will, but now I'd like to ask you about something else.~
@27   = ~Thanks for help. Now I have to go. Goodbye.~
@28   = ~Well, ask then. If I know the answer, I'll tell you.~
@29   = ~Are there any merchants in this village?~
@30   = ~Who are you, mister...?~
@31   = ~I changed my mind. I have no questions. Goodbye.~
@32   = ~Thank you for solving our problems. I will tell my friends about what you did. Now I'll have to look for some new men to work in the mines. Thank you again.~
@33   = ~Hello, my friend. Hope you are doing well. I think I need a bath. The work under the surface is quite hard.~
