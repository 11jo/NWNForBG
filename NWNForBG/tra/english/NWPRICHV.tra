@0 = ~Look, I don't mean to be rude - arguing with Captain Mung is draining. So you'll excuse me if I can't talk, all right? I've got supplies to move.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~What's going on between you and that other guy?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~What does it matter to you, huh? Ahh... I'm sorry. The name's Prichev - and I'm a little pressed for time right now if you can't tell. Hey, I don't mean to be burdening you with my troubles, but... well, I sure could use an ear. And who knows - maybe you can help?~ /*Hey, I don't mean to be burdening you with my troubles, but... well, I sure could use an ear. And who knows - maybe you can help?*/
@5 = ~Go on. I want to hear this.~
@6 = ~Sorry - this doesn't sound interesting. Goodbye.~
@7 = ~I've got two shipments - one going to Waterdeep, and one to Neverwinter. The Waterdhavian shipment is worth more, but the Neverwintan package is for relief - put together by the citizens of Port Llast. Good Captain Mung's only got room for one shipment. Of course, he wants the money from the valuable shipment - but the people of Neverwinter *need* this relief shipment.~ /*Good Captain Mung's only got room for one shipment. Of course, he wants the money from the valuable shipment - but the people of Neverwinter *need* this relief shipment.*/
@8 = ~I'll speak with the captain about taking the Neverwintan shipment.~
@9 = ~Isn't there some compromise that can be worked out?~
@10 = ~I spoke with the captain.~
@11 = ~NP: Yes. Good luck. I'll try once again to persuade this greedy pig to do something for people.~ /*Yes. Goodbye. Now, back to trying to convince a money-hungry pig to do something charitable.*/
@12 = ~I understand. This really isn't your business anyhow. I apologize for attempting to pull you into it.~
@13 = ~Thank you. I won't hold you to any promises, but if you can get him to change his mind, well... it would be the right thing.~
@14 = ~I wish there was, but really - this is black and white. The people of Port Llast have worked hard to help Neverwinter. I want that effort to be carried out.~
@15 = ~Yes, and what did he say? Will he take the Neverwintan shipment after all? To think of those desperate souls. Please tell me you talked some sense into him.~
@16 = ~NP: Not yet. I will talk to him again.~ /*Nevermind. I'll talk to him again.*/
@17 = ~I agree with him. You should give him the Waterdhavian shipment.~
@18 = ~I know I might seem tense, but - it is the situation that does this to me. Please, speak to him. I trust you will do well.~
@19 = ~Are you serious? Do you not understand what the situation is? Port Llast has come together to help Neverwinter's citizens - that shipment needs to be made. This will help their lives immensely. I understand the value of money, but it's not everything, you understand. This is for the good!~ /*Are you serious? Do you not understand what the situation is? Port Llast has come together to help Neverwinter's citizens - that shipment needs to be made.*/
@20 = ~I understand now. I'll speak with him.~
@21 = ~That's easy for you to say. You get paid either way.~
@22 = ~Perhaps some gold would change your mind?~
@23 = ~I don't care for your arguments or accusations. I'm not thinking business - I'm thinking aid. If you cannot help me, leave this matter alone. Now, is there something else? I have a shipment to get to Neverwinter, and apparently no boat to take it there. If you'll excuse me?~ /*Now, is there something else? I have a shipment to get to Neverwinter, and apparently no boat to take it there. If you'll excuse me?*/
@24 = ~Surely you can find a better use of your gold than ensuring another's profit? Take your bribes elsewhere, won't you? Now, is there something else? I have a shipment to get to Neverwinter, and apparently no boat to take it there. If you'll excuse me?~ /*Surely you can find a better use of your gold than ensuring another's profit? Take your bribes elsewhere, won't you?*/
@25 = ~Did you want to talk about something else? I'm sorry if I seem distracted - I just can't get over the argument I'm having with Captain Mung.~
@26 = ~NP: Tell me again, what happened to that guy?~ /*What's going on between you and that other guy?*/
@27 = ~I agree with him. You should give him the Waterdhavian shipment.~
@28 = ~Look, I saw you speaking with Captain Mung. I'm sure he told you some lies about me. At least let me tell you my side before you proclaim anything, will you?~
@29 = ~Listen, how about you give the captain the Waterdhavian shipment?~
@30 = ~NP: I don't even know what happened, but I finally have some goods going to Neverwinter now. Let me thank you, here is 400 gold.~ /*I don't even know what happened, but I got a bunch of goods that are making their way out to Neverwinter now. Let me thank you for it with this.*/
@31 = ~NP: Thanks, that's enough.~ /*I suppose it will have to do.*/
@32 = ~That's not a thank you. But a little more would be.~
@33 = ~You can give me more, or I can go talk to the captain again.~
@34 = ~NP: I won't take the money, helping Neverwinter is the right thing to do.~ /*Thank you. Helping Neverwinter was the right thing.*/
@35 = ~NP: Thank you for your concern,<SIRMAAM> . Now I'll take care of shipping, goodbye.~ /*Thank you for your concern, <SIRMAAM>. My name is Jaheel. What is your name?*/
@36 = ~Yes, I suppose it would. You have done well, and I am in good spirits. Fine, take this extra gold to go with my thanks.~
@37 = ~Port Llast has spent much already, just to prepare these goods. To ask more would be too much. I must ask you to withdraw your request.~
@38 = ~NP: Open up or I'll go talk to the captain again.~ /*You can give me more, or I can go talk to the captain again.*/
@39 = ~I should have known better than to think this could be done out of kindness. Profit is always the reasoning behind things, isn't it? Here, take this money. At least I can be contented in the knowledge that the shipment will make it to Neverwinter.~ /*I should have known better than to think this could be done out of kindness. Profit is always the reasoning behind things, isn't it?*/
@40 = ~And this day, this act of kindness - ah, my faith in humanity is strong. Thank you, kind <SIRMAAM>. Thank you.~
@41 = ~NP: What?! I should have learned not to trust you. Because of you, the goods Neverwinter needs will not get into the city.~ /*What?! I should have known I couldn't trust you. Things get a little too risky for you, and suddenly the agreed-upon price isn't good enough.*/
@42 = ~Well, in the end, it's been a good day. Port Llast came together, and we got some aid out to Neverwinter. Good people do exist, after all.~
