@0 = ~I'm warning you - If you be lookin' for our boy Urth, he ain't here.~
@1 = ~Get out of here, you dirty scoundrel.~
@2 = ~You've done the three of us a fine favor, <GIRLBOY>, and I'd like you to have somethin' that's been in our family awhile. A chest of 300 gold. 'Twas my inheritance but I've been too scared to spend it. Now's as good a time to be rid of it as any.~ 
@3 = ~That's more than enough. May the gods bless you.~
@4 = ~Actually, I could use another 100 gold.~
@5 = ~Nice try. Give me everything you've got or your precious boy gets it.~
@6 = ~May the winds be ever at your back, my friend.~
@7 = ~Of course, good <CHARNAME>. It's not easy being an adventurer, as Urth learned almost too late.~
@8 = ~Of what use are your deeds if we all starve over the winter? I'm sorry, that's too much for me to give.~
@9 = ~Okay, actually 500 gold pieces is quite enough.~ 
@10 = ~Why, may the weather rot you, <CHARNAME>! We'll starve the winter, rest assured, but here be your devil's gold.~ 
@11 = ~Aye, this has become a happy home again.~
@12 = ~You heard the missus. Now move on.~
@13 = ~They're rickety an' - an' it's a danger to climb them, you hear?~
