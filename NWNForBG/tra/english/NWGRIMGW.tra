@0 = ~I know you. You were hired by Aribeth to search for the Waterdhavian creatures.~ [NWGRIM51] 
@1 = ~Who are you? How do you know about my assignment?~ 
@2 = ~I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.~ 
@3 = ~I am Grimgnaw, a priest of the Order of the Long Death. The grisly account of the Academy is no great secret, <CHARNAME>. Not to those who seek such things out.~ 
@4 = ~You seem a little bit creepy, Grimgnaw.~ 
@5 = ~What kind of skills does a priest of the Order of the Long Death possess?~ 
@6 = ~What's a priest of the Long Death order doing in Neverwinter?~
@7 = ~You are welcome to return should you have need of my skills, <CHARNAME>. If not, we shall meet again at our final end, when the Silent Lord claims us all.~
@8 = ~Many find the members of my Order unsettling, for we embrace Death in all its incarnations. Yet in times like these, my skills are in great demand.~
@9 = ~Much like the members of your own Order, a priest of the Long Death learns the skill to serve the will of the master.~
@10 = ~I am a disciple of torment and a messenger of Death, the Silent Lord. I bring the absolution of pain and anguish to my enemies to prepare them for a brutal - and purifying - end. In truth my skills are not so different from any soldier or hired blade, though I embrace the beauty and perfection of my enemy's death with a zeal others often lack.~
@11 = ~There is a foul taint upon this city. Death - true, permanent death - is perfect in its absolute finality. Pain, suffering, anguish, torture: these are the tools that prepare us for my master's soothing embrace. But this plague is unnatural, it's victims never pass to embrace of the Silent Lord. The Wailing Death is a blight upon the world that must be ended. So far I have uncovered no answers on my own that might help end this epidemic, though I am eager to search the Beggar's Nest.~ 
@12 = ~What's in the Beggar's Nest?~
@13 = ~I have heard rumors that in that blighted district zombies walk the streets. Few things are so reviled by my order as the abomination of the undead. It would be reasonable to imagine there is some connection between the undead and the unnatural end of those who succumb to the Wailing Death.~ 
@14 = ~Why haven't you investigated the Beggar's Nest yourself?~
@15 = ~I'm looking for a good mercenary to help me in my mission.~
@16 = ~Alone I am not likely to survive the dangers of the district, and throwing my life away is a foolish way to serve the Silent Lord. My death will come in its appointed time.~
@17 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some hired help to assist me on my mission.~
@18 = ~I'll be going now.~
@19 = ~The priests and priests of the Order of the Dying Death rarely join those who are not members of their order, but I can smell my master's mark on you. A storm of blood is raging around you, torment and death follow your arrival... Yet there are many whom death will follow in this city - many who are willing to pay for my services. My fee to join your cause is 850 gold.~ 
@20 = ~Here's your 850 gold. Welcome aboard, Grimgnaw.~ 
@21 = ~How about 650 and the promise of lots and lots of killing?~
@22 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@23 = ~I foresee a future of brutal and savage slaughter at your side, <CHARNAME>. My Order will be pleased. My hands will bring death to your enemies, and all my skills are ready for your orders.~ 
@24 = ~I foresee a future of brutal, savage slaughter at your side, <CHARNAME>. Very well, I will join you for 650. My hands will bring death to your enemies, and all my skills are ready for your orders.~ 
@25 = ~There are many who can offer me the chance to revel in the joys of killing and death - and they will pay far more for my services. My offer stands at 850.~
@26 = ~Then I am afraid we cannot work together, though I have no doubt you will be an instrument of destruction and an agent of Death even without me at your side.~
@27 = ~You are back, <CHARNAME>. The blood from those slaughtered at the Academy may be washed away, but I still recognize the mark of Death upon you.~ [NWGRIM52]
@28 = ~Who are you? How do you know about the Academy?~
@29 = ~I want to ask you some questions about Neverwinter.~
@30 = ~There is little I can tell you about the city. I came expecting to find the pureness of suffering and the beautiful anguish of death. Instead I discovered the plague is a foul abomination. It robs Death of its rightful claim and denies its victims the cold embrace of the Silent Lord. So far I have uncovered no answers on my own that might help end this epidemic, though I am eager to search the Beggar's Nest.~ 
@31 = ~We meet again, <CHARNAME>. I taste a storm of slaughter on the air; I'm not surprised to find you here at the center of the whirlwind.~ [NWGRIM53]
@32 = ~What are you doing here, Grimgnaw?~ 
@33 = ~You again? Are you following me like some kind of pathetic lost puppy?~
@34 = ~Goodbye.~
@35 = ~When we parted ways, <CHARNAME>, I meant to return to my Order. But I bow to the Silent Lord and I discovered I could best serve his will by staying in Neverwinter for the time being. I am eager to find and slaughter those who unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter. Thousands were taken by the disease, their essence stolen from the grasp of true Death.~
@36 = ~Ultimately I follow no one but the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. I have been drawn here in the service of my master, Death.~
@37 = ~Return to me if you require an ally in your mission. Together we can help sow the seeds of destruction throughout the land and reap a harvest of agony and death.~
@38 = ~That was why I answered Lord Nasher's desperate call for mercenaries to come to Port Llast. He is also anxious to root out those behind the Wailing Death.~
@39 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@40 = ~How much would it cost to hire your services?~ 
@41 = ~When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists. Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?~ 
@42 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@43 = ~I could use a priest.~
@44 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@45 = ~Their location is well hidden. However, I would not be surprised to learn they are connected with the village of Charwood.~
@46 = ~Charwood?~
@47 = ~What is this place?~
@48 = ~Then together we shall sow death and destruction throughout the land in our quest to destroy those behind the Wailing Death.~
@49 = ~The town has isolated itself from the rest of the world, far to the South of Port Llast. Few outside my Order even remember such a place exists. The town is a strange place; there is a foul taint upon it that we of the Long Death can feel. None of the emissaries my Order has sent south to investigate Charwood has ever returned.~ 
@50 = ~It would not surprisie me to discover links to the cult behind the Wailing Death in that unnatural place. Is there more I can do for you, <CHARNAME>?~
@51 = ~We meet again, <CHARNAME>. It is I, Grimgnaw of the Order of the Long Death. Surely you must remember me. I have been eagerly waiting for my chance to extract vengeance on the cult responsible for unleashing the plague on Neverwinter.~ [NWGRIM55]
@52 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@53 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@54 = ~If you're so interested in vengeance, why are you standing around here?~
@55 = ~I am eager to punish those who unleashed the Wailing Death upon Neverwinter. Thousands were taken by the disease, their essence stolen from the grasp of true Death.~
@56 = ~Running helter skelter on my own would do little to locate the cult, and even less to further the cause of Death, whom I serve. Your reputation is well known, <CHARNAME>. I have heard many tales of the slaughter you rain down upon those who dare oppose you.~ 
@57 = ~The mark of Death is upon you. If we join together we shall unleash a storm of devastation to ravage the North and feed the eternal hunger of the Silent Lord.~
@58 = ~I guess I could use a homicidal priest at my side. You're in.~
@59 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@60 = ~I know you. You are <CHARNAME>, the one who emerged from the corpse clogged streets of Neverwinter to save the city from the horrors of the Wailing Death.~ [NWGRIM54] 
@61 = ~Well, I wasn't acting alone. Aribeth and the other city guard did as much as I.~ 
@62 = ~Yes, that would be me.~
@63 = ~Others may have been involved, but I know the truth of things. I see the mark of the Silent Lord upon you.~
@64 = ~I have known about your existence for a while. The most beautiful whirlpool of inhuman slaughter revolves around you. I am Grimgnaw, a priest of the Order of the Long Death. No doubt you have come for the same reason as I: to join Aribeth in hunting and slaying the cult that was responsible for the Wailing Death.~
