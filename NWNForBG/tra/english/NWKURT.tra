@0 = ~Greetings, stranger. You've been rather the trouble-maker, haven't you? You've cut through my men rather efficiently. I can respect that.~ [NWKURT55]
@1 = ~In fact, I could use someone as strong as you to get rid of Baram for me. Not an easy task, I grant, but I'd reward you well. What would you say to that?~
@2 = ~What would the reward be, exactly?~
@3 = ~Baram is already dead, actually.~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions, first.~
@5 = ~I would never work for you!~
@6 = ~NP: Well, let's see. I have a couple items that might be of interest to you..... They're quite expensive. And on top of that, 1,000 gold pieces, how about that? What you have to do is bring me the head of Baram. Are you interested?~ /*Well, let's see. I have a few magic items here that might interest you... they are worth a great deal. Plus 1000 gold pieces on top of that?*/
@7 = ~I want to get into the Host Tower.~
@8 = ~What about Elynwyd's sister, Evaine? Do you have her?~
@9 = ~Baram already made me the same offer.~
@10 = ~Perhaps. I want more gold, however.~
@11 = ~Aye, I'm interested.~
@12 = ~So you've already spoken to Baram... and the little rat had the same idea I had, did he? Well, well. What do you plan to do, then, stranger?~
@13 = ~I was hoping you could make me a better offer.~
@14 = ~Nothing at all.~
@15 = ~NP: Well, then. It shows your sanity and that Baram wasted his money. Either way, you've come a long way. Try to pass through this gate, and I will decide if you intend to honor your agreement with Baram. Do you understand?~ /*Either way, you've come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I'll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?*/
@16 = ~NP: Yes? Are you serious? I find that very hard to believe. High Captain Salzek was also thought dead, but my trusted source tells me he's alive. You don't have his head, do you? That would be conclusive evidence.~ /*Oh? You don't say? I find that hard to believe... High Captain Suljack was supposed to be dead, as well, but I've had it on good authority he's quite alive.*/
@17 = ~Yes, I have his head here.~
@18 = ~NP: Uh. I don't have a head.~ /*Uhhh... no, me not haves head.*/
@19 = ~I'd be more than willing to answer your questions... *if* you agree to kill Baram.~
@20 = ~NP: Ahhhh, what a shame! If you change your mind, be sure to let me know. And if you have any ideas on how you can break down this door. I strongly advise you to forget about them.~ /*And should you get any ideas about continuing your path past this portcullis... I'd forget them, were I you.*/
@21 = ~NP: And why would you want to go in there? I guess it's none of my business. If you're looking for your death, I won't interfere. Anyway, I'm not going to give you my papers and quarrel with the tower. But Baram has papers too... Take my offer and you can take them from him if you want.~ /*Regardless, I'm not about to cross the tower by giving you my own papers. Baram has his own, however... accept my offer and you can take his, if you wish.*/
@22 = ~The elf girl? Why... yes, I do. Quite a pretty lass, that one. Why would she interest you?~
@23 = ~I want her released.~
@24 = ~I just wanted to know that, that's all.~
@25 = ~Greedy, are we? Ha ha... I could learn to like you. Very well: 1250 gold pieces, no more. What do you think now?~
@26 = ~I want to get into the Host Tower, as well.~
@27 = ~No, thanks.~
@28 = ~NP: That's good to hear! Let's hope you can help me settle this case... And then we'll all be happy. Now, uh. I guess you have some questions for me, right? Or are you ready to go and give that little rat what he deserves?~ /*Now, then... I imagine you have some questions for me, yes? Or are you ready to go and give that little rat what he deserves?*/
@29 = ~I have some questions.~
@30 = ~I've changed my mind.~
@31 = ~I'll go now.~
@32 = ~Hmmm... I just might, at that. What is the little rat paying you?~
@33 = ~1000 gold pieces.~
@34 = ~1500 gold pieces.~
@35 = ~2000 gold pieces.~
@36 = ~You forgets it. Me not interested.~
@37 = ~NP: Ha! I don't believe for a second that you'll keep your promise! In any case, you've already gone too far. Try to walk through that door, and I'll decide if you intend to honor your agreement with Baram. Do you understand?~ /*Either way, you've come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I'll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?*/
@38 = ~NP: Really? Well, show me. Ahhhh, yeah. That is indeed Baram's head. I was told that rat had been killed, but I wasn't sure it was you. All right, stranger. you have earned your reward. Here's the gold and items you were promised. Take it and go.~ /*Ahhhh, yes... that is, indeed, Baram's head. I'd heard the rat had been recently killed, I simply wasn't sure you were the one who'd done it.*/
@39 = ~What about Evaine?~
@40 = ~I want Evaine released, as well.~
@41 = ~That's it? We're done?~
@42 = ~NP: Good. Now we can kill you.~ /*Good. Time to kill you, now.*/
@43 = ~Ah. Well, until I see the rat's little head up close, I'll not believe he's dead for a second.~
@44 = ~Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. Bring me Baram's head and you can have her.~
@45 = ~NP:  Then what about my first offer? Baram's head in exchange for gold?~ /*Fair enough. What about my original offer, then? Baram's head in exchange for the reward... ?*/
@46 = ~Now, now, stranger... 1000 gold is a lot of coin, and that's *if* you can do the job. Are you interested or not?~
@47 = ~NP: Ahhhh, what a shame! If you change your mind, be sure to let me know. And if you have any ideas on how you can get out of these bars. I strongly advise you to forget about them.~ /*And should you get any ideas about continuing your path past this portcullis... I'd forget them, were I you.*/
@48 = ~Ask away.~
@49 = ~What do you hope to get out of all this?~
@50 = ~Do you know what's going on in the Host Tower?~
@51 = ~Where can I find Baram?~
@52 = ~What do you know about Baram's defenses?~
@53 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@54 = ~I just wanted to know, that's all.~
@55 = ~NP: You did? I think you've been trying to outsmart me the whole way. Well, stranger. Good for you. Good work. You think your cunning plans will work, but step foot in my fortress and you'll change your mind.~ /*However you think your schemes will turn out, attempt to take one foot into my base and you will quickly discover otherwise.*/
@56 = ~NP: That's great. I hope to have Baram's head soon. I should warn you that our deal with you is best kept secret so Baram doesn't get wind of it. My men on the streets don't know you're working for me now, so they'll still attack you.... But it seems like you've been okay with that so far. Oh. I'll tell you something else. Whatever deal we make, if you try to infiltrate my base, I'll consider your intentions hostile. But you wouldn't do that, would you?~ /*Just so you're aware, I'd rather keep word of our deal a secret, so Baram doesn't get wind of it. My men on the street won't know you're working for me, so no doubt they'll still attack you... not that they've hindered you so far.*/

@58 = ~Is that so? I can offer you more, then... 1500 gold pieces. Plus a magic item or two, to make it interesting. All for Baram's head... what do you say?~
@59 = ~Is that so? I can offer you more, then... 1500 gold pieces. Plus a magic item or two, to make it interesting. All for Baram's head... what do you say?~
@60 = ~I'm sure he's not paying you so much. I will, however... 1500 gold, plus a few magic items, all for Baram's head. What do you say?~
@61 = ~NP: Ha! I don't believe for a second that you'll keep your promise! In any case, you've already gone too far. Try to pass through this gate, and I will decide if you intend to honor your agreement. Understood?~ /*Either way, you've come quite far enough. Attempt to come pass this gate and I'll just have to assume you intend to carry out your agreement. Understand?*/
@62 = ~NP: What about her? Oh. Well, did you really think I'd set her free? That's very foolish of you! That girl is a source of endless pleasure and enjoyment. Since I'm the last High Captain, I can do anything I want. And I'll keep her, thank you. As for you, our business is finished. Go away. before you get hurt.~ /*The girl's been a source of endless pleasure and amusement. Since I'm the last High Captain, I can do what I like... and I'll be holding onto her, thank you.*/
@63 = ~Fine. But this isn't over.~
@64 = ~NP: I've killed one High Captain. I could easily kill another.~ /*I killed one High Captain, Baram... I can just as easily kill another.*/
@65 = ~That's horrible! You'll never get away with this!~
@66 = ~NP: Wait, wait, wait. That wasn't part of our deal, was it? And even if it was, I doubt I'd let her go. That girl is a source of endless pleasure and enjoyment. Since I'm the last High Captain, I can do whatever I want.... And I'll keep her, thank you. As for you, our business is finished. Go away. before you get hurt.~ /*The girl's been a source of endless pleasure and amusement. Since I'm the last High Captain, I can do what I like... and I'll be holding onto her, thank you.*/
@67 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@68 = ~Oh? Don't be a fool, stranger. I am the last High Captain and I have much to plan for... be smart and run along, now.~
@69 = ~Perhaps you thought I was joking when I said I wished Baram's head. I'm not... run back to wherever you left him or you'll receive no reward.~
@70 = ~NP: If Baram is really dead, I think you will hurry and run to the place where you left him to bring me his head, won't you? It won't be hard... Unless he's *not* dead. Either way, I'll reward you handsomely for his death.~ /*So if Baram is actually dead, I'm sure you won't mind running back to wherever it is you left him and fetching his head for me, now, would you?*/
@71 = ~What kind of reward?~
@72 = ~No Thanks~
@73 = ~I'm interested.~
@74 = ~NP: Then what about my first offer? Baram's head in exchange for gold?~ /*Fair enough. What about my original offer, then? Baram's head in exchange for the reward... ?*/
@75 = ~What of elf girl, Evaine?~
@76 = ~Ask away.~
@77 = ~NP: You did? I think you've been trying to outsmart me the whole way. Well, stranger. Good for you. Good work. You think your cunning plans will work, but step foot in my fortress and you'll change your mind.~ /*However you think your schemes will turn out, attempt to take one foot into my base and you will quickly discover otherwise.*/
@78 = ~NP: That's great. I hope to have Baram's head soon. I should warn you that our deal with you is best kept secret so Baram doesn't get wind of it. My men on the streets don't know you're working for me now, so they'll still attack you.... But it seems like you've been okay with that so far. Also, no matter what deals we make, if you try to infiltrate my base, I'll consider your intentions hostile. But you wouldn't do that, would you?~ /*Just so you're aware, I'd rather keep word of our deal a secret, so Baram doesn't get wind of it. My men on the street won't know you're working for me, so no doubt they'll still attack you... not that they've hindered you so far.*/
@79 = ~NP: Ha ha! Pretty straightforward question, isn't it? Most people think I just want to rule the city... Or lost my mind. But it's not that simple. The only High Captain left alive will become the military leader of Luskan... And that will be me.~ /*Ha ha! That's a rather forward question, isn't it? Most people simply assume I want to rule the city... or have gone insane.*/
@80 = ~Why would Luskan need a war leader?~
@81 = ~NP: There had been a bloody power struggle in the tower lately, and now there was a new Secret Archmage. We've only met the wizard once. His name is Maugrim. Quite an interesting fellow. He seems to hate Neverwinter with a fierce hatred.~ /*I've met the mage once, only. His name is Maugrim... quite an interesting fellow. Seems to hate Neverwinter something fierce, it seems.*/
@82 = ~In the sewers, of course, where we drove him to. He's got himself walled up in a little fortress down there, surrounded by necromancers.~
@83 = ~NP: Not much. Although you should know that Baram has infected himself with lycanthropy. I don't call him a rat for nothing! He's also infected most of his people with the disease... And no doubt has his necromancers raising more and more undead for him. Now he's gathering them all in his fortress, I don't know exactly why... But you should be aware of what may await you.~ /*He's spread the disease to most of his men, as well... and no doubt has had his necromancers whipping up undead like mad.*/
@84 = ~Aye? What do you wish, then?~
@85 = ~I want Elynwyd's sister released, as well.~
@86 = ~Why would ye even care? I certainly don't.~
@87 = ~Oh, but it is. Come into my base and you'll be killed, to put it simply. Now... if you'll excuse me, I have things to attend to.~
@88 = ~Take one step in here and you'll be gutted like a rat. I am no Baram, after all. Now... if you'll excuse me, I have plans to make.~
@89 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@90 = ~NP: Yes, a little. There's been a bloody power struggle in the tower lately, and now there's a new Secret Archmage. We've only met the wizard once. His name is Maugrim. Quite an interesting fellow. He seems to hate Neverwinter with a fierce hatred.~ /*I've met the mage once, only. His name is Maugrim... quite an interesting fellow. Seems to hate Neverwinter something fierce, it seems.*/
@91 = ~Hmmm... you want me to give her up, do you? Very well. But only once you've brought me Baram's head. No sooner.~
@92 = ~Then why even bring her up? She certainly isn't the first woman I've taken for my... personal use.~
@93 = ~Now that would be telling. I'm sure you'll know soon enough.~
@94 = ~Back again, are you, stranger? Have you changed your mind and given my offer some thought, perhaps?~ [NWKURT54]
@95 = ~Hah! I've no interest in working for you.~
@96 = ~What is it now? I trust you bring me word of Baram's death, correct?~ [NWKURT52]
@97 = ~I do. Baram is dead.~
@98 = ~Very well. I hope to see Baram's head soon.~
@99 = ~NP: Baram is dead.~ /*Baram dead, already.*/
@100 = ~We have no further business, you and I! Take one step into my base and you'll pay the consequences, fool!~ [NWKURT51]
