@0 = ~NP: The local cemetery is haunted by the undead at night. If you want to visit your grandmother's grave, bring a weapon, or you'd better not. It all started after some sorcerer from the Brotherhood of the Mysteries of Luskan was buried there.~ /*The board reads: 'BEWARE! The undead are restless. Bring weapons to visit Grandma or don't visit her at all. Really.' It is signed: The Caretaker.*/
@1 = ~NP: The captains in Luskan are at odds with each other over power, and they're at war. That's why they closed the gates.~ /*The High Captains have been fighting for weeks now. Half the city's been burnt up or butchered.*/
@2 = ~NP: South of the Green Gryphon, the road to Port Llast became dangerous. After Luskan stopped patrolling the road, travelers began to be attacked by creatures like orcs and bugbears. They used to sit quietly in their caves, but they say someone controls them.~ /*There's some deserted ruins in the land to the south of this fort. One of my scouting parties was down there and they came across some strange columns of magical light.*/
@3 = ~NP: They say there are werewolves in Port Llast, attacking the locals at night and tearing them apart. Now they've gotten here, too, people saw a werewolf near the tavern the other day.~ /*The nobles in the Blacklake have been put in their place, I hear. I hope, anyway. They're too full of themselves at the best of times.*/
@4 = ~NP: We've got some kind of evil cult in the neighborhood. They say Lady Aribet herself is here to catch them.~ /*Hmm. There be a temple to Tyr close by. Not sure if the priests yet live, however.*/
@5 = ~NP: Five dangerous criminals have escaped from Waterdeep Prison. It's doubtful, but still possible, that they went straight here. There's a minotaur who's taken up residence here, locked himself in his room and won't come out, only asking for food and ale. I wondered if he was a criminal, because he looked like a bandit.~ /*I knew as soon as he uttered those words that he would be off on another of his grand adventures. I wanted to go with him, but I was involved in preparing a special celebration for the temple.*/
@6 = ~NP: I haven't heard from Charwood in a while. Rumor has it that it's full of the undead now, some ghosts have appeared, it's just creepy!~ /*Chief of goblin sees you. What you want now? You gots news for us?*/
@7 = ~NP: It's best not to go into Neverwinter Forest. They say the animals there have gone wild, even the deer and rabbits are attacking everyone.~ /*Are you sure you can't afford more? This is your friend I found, after all.*/
