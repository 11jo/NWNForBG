@0 = ~Is there something you want?~ [BODDIN50]
@1 = ~I just want to talk for a while.~
@2 = ~Nothing, I'm all right.~
@3 = ~I am a staunch proponent of the free exchange of ideas, <CHARNAME>. What is it you wish to know?~
@4 = ~If you're going to be my henchman, I'd like to know more about you.~
@5 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@6 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@7 = ~Do you have any advice or suggestions you can give me about my mission?~
@8 = ~Then we should get back to your mission.~
@9 = ~NP: Your request makes perfect sense, <CHARNAME>, and I'll be happy to answer your queries. However, as you might expect, I have a few questions as well. Why are you here? What are the events behind your service to Aribeth and the city of Neverwinter?~ /*Your request is completely logical, <CHARNAME>, and I will be happy to answer your inquiries. However, as you might expect I have some questions of my own.*/
@10 = ~I have seen too much death and suffering from the plague to stand idly by.~
@11 = ~I seek to forge a legend that will last for ever.~
@12 = ~Aribeth has promised me gold and riches if I can help her in this.~
@13 = ~Compassion is an admirable trait, <CHARNAME>, though I must confess my own motivations when I came here were quite different.~
@14 = ~I should have guessed, <CHARNAME>. The allure of fame is a common connection among many who undertake missions such as yours. My own motivations were somewhat different.~
@15 = ~I should have guessed, <CHARNAME>. The allure of gold is a common connection among many who undertake missions such as yours. My own motivations in coming here were somewhat different.~
@16 = ~NP: When I heard about the plague, I was seized by the excitement of scientific discovery. I thought that by applying the principles of observation and experimentation, I might discover a cure for the plague. It wasn't until I arrived that I realized how false my preconceived notions had been. I believe that the need to learn this lesson was one of the reasons my mentor insisted on sending me away from Lantana.~ /*It was only after I arrived that I realized how wrong my preconceived notions were. I suppose the need to learn this lesson was one of the reasons my mentor insisted on sending me out from Lantan.*/
@17 = ~Your mentor?~
@18 = ~NP: Sorry, I don't have time to talk right now.~ /*I don't have time to speak to you anymore.*/
@19 = ~NP: I am a warlock, I have the ability to release powerful and dangerous forces. I would be a fool to go down the path of this career, on finding someone more experienced than me to guide me. Be that as it may, warlocks and wizards are not common in Lanthan. We prefer to find scientific solutions rather than rely on magic.~ /*I am a sorcerer, I have the ability to unleash powerful and dangerous forces. I would have been foolish to undertake this career path without seeking the guidance of one more experienced than I.*/
@20 = ~At last I managed to locate another who could train me in the arcane arts - a human sorcerer named Prophyro who lived in a secluded tower on the far side of the island.~
@21 = ~And he took you in?~
@22 = ~NP: What surprises me is that he accepted a gnome for the training course.~ /*I'm surprised he would have accepted a gnome for training.*/
@23 = ~NP: I confess that when I first came to Profiro Tower, I did not receive a warm welcome. Or, to be more accurate, I should say I received an overly hot reception. Just as I approached Profiro Tower, as a large lizard peeked out from behind a nearby bush. This alerted me. However, when the creature opened its jaws and spewed out a jet of fire, I was horrified.~ /*Just as I reached Prophyro's tower a large lizard popped out from behind a nearby bush. It was somewhat alarming. However, when the creature opened its jaws and belched forth a jet of flame I became absolutely terrified.*/
@24 = ~I fled back the way I had come, the fire drake's blasts of flame licking at my heels the entire way. As soon as I passed beyond the boundaries of Prophyro's land, the creature turned and disappeared back into the bushes.~
@25 = ~NP: And then what did you do?~ /*What you gonna do?*/
@26 = ~I guess Prophyro didn't like guests.~
@27 = ~You should have killed it!~
@28 = ~NP: Once I calmed my thoughts, I realized that the dragon's fiery tongues had a dual purpose: to keep Profiro's peace, but also to challenge those who wanted to be an apprentice and wished to pass to him. I was certain that if I could find a way to outsmart the creature, Profiro would see my potential and accept me as an apprentice. The problem was how to get past the creature, for my magic was barely good enough to light a candle.~ /*If I could find a way to best the creature I was certain Prophyro would see my potential and accept me as an apprentice. The problem was how to get past the creature when my magic was barely capable of igniting a candle.*/
@29 = ~Easier said than done, I'm afraid. I am not skilled with weapons and at the time my magic was of such low level as to be virtually useless. Plus, killing the pet of the man I wanted to study under was hardly a good first impression.~
@30 = ~I had to rely on my mind to solve the problem, so I began to analyze the facts as I knew them. And I realized the creature was nothing more than an illusion.~
@31 = ~An illusion? How did you figure that out?~
@32 = ~NP: So it was an illusion?~ /*What kind of guild is this?*/
@33 = ~NP: I was just reviewing the evidence. Fire dragons are not common on my island, and the climate is hardly suitable for their survival. Plus, I didn't notice any burning tufts of grass or burned bushes on the ground. And the flames I felt on my heels did no damage to my shoes or my clothes. Armed with irrefutable proof that this was an illusion, I went back to the tower.~ /*I simply looked at the evidence. Fire drakes are not indigenous to my island and the climate is hardly suitable for one to survive. Plus, I had noticed no burnt patches of grass or scorched bushes on the grounds.*/
@34 = ~NP: When the lizard appeared, I simply ignored it. It attacked me, spewing fire and smoke from its mouth. But I continued on my way, and a second before the creature was about to knock me down, it disappeared in a pillar of light. The sash of the tower door opened. I stepped inside and saw an old man in a robe. He smiled at me and said, "Well done, Boddinock Glinkle. You have proven yourself worthy to be my apprentice. I am Profiro."~ /*When the lizard appeared I simply ignored it. It charged straight at me, fire and smoke spewing from its jaws. But I held my ground and a split second before the beast bowled me over it disappeared in a shower of light.*/
@35 = ~What was it like as his apprentice?~
@36 = ~Great story. Think we can continue with our mission now?~
@37 = ~NP: Sorry, <CHARNAME>, but this probably isn't a good time to discuss this, is it? After all, Neverwinter is threatened by a cult.~ /*I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, but this isn't the most reasonable time to discuss this, is it? After all, Neverwinter is in great peril.*/
@38 = ~You are right, of course. My tale can wait, we have more pressing matters to attend to right now.~
@39 = ~You seem quite interested in my time as an apprentice under Prophyro, <CHARNAME>. I suppose we can afford a few minutes for me to recount those days for you.~
@40 = ~You are a sorcerer just as I am, <CHARNAME>. Logically I would assume our experiences in our early training were quite similar.~
@41 = ~NP: Profiro instilled in me the basic principles of magic and the hidden laws governing the mysteries. His knowledge and wisdom inspired me, though he lacked the skill of an organizer. I kept coming across magical items scattered carelessly throughout the tower. Mixtures and elixirs from half-finished experiments were left lying on the kitchen table...~ /*I would constantly stumble across magic items carelessly strewn about the tower. Potions and elixirs from half finished experiments would be left sitting out on the kitchen table.*/
@42 = ~NP: The ancient scrolls he'd copied were stuffed under the cushions of his chairs, wands lying on cabinets and dressers. And he never, ever locked his laboratory, despite the incredible power of the magical items and the danger of the experiments he was engaged in.~ /*And he never, ever locked his laboratory despite the countless powerful magic items and dangerous experiments he often dabbled in.*/
@43 = ~You must have found that quite a temptation.~
@44 = ~You must have gotten into all kinds of trouble fiddling around with all those magical items.~
@45 = ~NP: I confess, it was hard to look at all those potions, wands, scrolls just lying around. And I have to admit, in the end, I gave in to temptation. I just snapped. I couldn't take it anymore, and I did something rash and completely uncharacteristic of me. I waited until my teacher left on a long trip, and then I... cleaned up Profiro's lab!~ /*I just snapped. I couldn't take it anymore, and I did something rash and completely out of character. I waited until my Master left on an extended trip and then I... I cleaned up Prophyro's laboratory!*/
@46 = ~NP: What? You don't think I was foolish enough to play with things whose power is beyond my comprehension? I came to Profiro so he could teach me. And it was illogical for me to begin my own experiments. What would be the point of training if I were going to do that?~ /*I came to Prophyro so he could teach me. It wouldn't be logical for me to begin experimenting on my own. What would have been the point of studying under him if I was going to do that?*/
@47 = ~NP: I sorted through scrolls, potions, and wands. I made shelves to store the magical components of his research and created a card system catalog so he could cross-reference all of his test results. Items of special power or unstable items I locked in a safe, magically protected chest, the key to which I gave to Profiro when he returned.~ /*I organized the scrolls and potions and wands. I built shelves to store the magical components of his research and I made a catalog card system so he could cross reference all of his tests and results.*/
@48 = ~That's it? You cleaned up?~
@49 = ~NP: And what did your teacher say to that?~ /*What do I get for doing this?*/
@50 = ~What can I say, <CHARNAME>. I was young and foolish. Prophyro's own reaction was similar to yours - he couldn't believe what I had done, although he did continue to use the filing system I had set up for him.~
@51 = ~NP: With magic like that, you didn't even try to use it? What kind of magician are you?~ /*You had all that magic at your fingertips and you didn't even try to use any of it? What kind of sorcerer are you? Weren't you even curious?*/
@52 = ~NP: Of course I was curious, <CHARNAME>, but my thirst for experimentation was tamed by reason. Imagine the damage I could have done had I ventured into an experiment of my own. I was a student, in my actions I had to follow the lead of my teacher. A different course of action would have been... illogical.~ /*Of course I was curious, <CHARNAME>, but my hunger for experimentation was tempered by reason. Imagine the damage I could have done if I had dared experiment on my own.*/
@53 = ~That's hardly an adventursome attitude.~
@54 = ~Logic and reason are fine, but they can be mighty boring.~
@55 = ~I guess your actions make sense, now that you've explained them.~
@56 = ~NP: I agree that my actions may have seemed overly, uh. cautious. But that is the way of my people. Curiosity is tamed by careful analysis. Nevertheless, when I left Lanthan, I found myself becoming more brave in my quest for discovery. Eventually I came to a city infested with plague, to chronicle a new disease among other things.~ /*However, ever since I left Lantan I find I am growing more bold in my quest for discovery. After all, I did come to a plague infested city in order to chronicle a new disease... among other things.*/
@57 = ~Among other things? What do you mean - is there another reason you came to Neverwinter?~
@58 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I should not have said anything about this to you. It is really a trivial matter and you have far more important things on your mind.~
@59 = ~You can tell me, Boddyknock. Maybe it's something I can help you with.~
@60 = ~Fine - just don't let it distract you from the job at hand!~
@61 = ~Ask me about this again later, <CHARNAME>, and I will be happy to continue my tale. But for now we should focus on your mission for Lady Aribeth.~
@62 = ~You don't have to worry about that, <CHARNAME>. I'm anxious to find the source of this foul plague, and I won't let my other interests get in the way.~
@63 = ~NP: I told you before that I came to Neverwinter to study the Howling Death,<CHARNAME>. But there is also another reason for my coming. With everything that has happened, it doesn't seem important right now. Since you're asking this question, I must conclude that you're curious about my motivations. I came to Neverwinter in search of bread.~ /*I told you earlier I came to Neverwinter to study the Wailing Death, <CHARNAME>. But there was another reason I came, as well. Given all that has happened, it seems rather unimportant now.*/
@64 = ~NP: How's that?~ /*Who the man?*/
@65 = ~Bread?~
@66 = ~NP: I know how silly this sounds, but I've heard stories about a special kind of bread that is only available here in Neverwinter-it's called yeast bread. They say the bread stays fresh for months and never gets stale or moldy. I hoped on my way to Neverwinter that I could find someone to teach me the secret of this wonderful yeast bread.~ /*It is said the loaf stays fresh for months and that it will never go stale or moldy. I was hoping that when I came to Neverwinter I could find someone to teach me the secret of making this wondrous leaven bread.*/
@67 = ~NP: If I can identify the substances that prevent bread from becoming stale, I think such principles can be applied to the benefit of many other industries as well! After a little research, this discovery could mean much more than just bread. When I arrived in town I searched for the recipe for some time, but it seemed that only a few master bakers knew it, unfortunately they all died in the plague.~ /*If we could determine the agents that keep the bread from spoiling I think the principles could be applied to any number of other uses! With a little research this discovery could mean so much more than simple bread.*/
@68 = ~NP: I assume that someone still has a copy of the recipe somewhere, but the more I saw death and suffering in that place, the less important the search for yeast bread became to me. I believe that discovering yeast dough for baking bread could do a lot of good, and one day I would bring the recipe to my home on Lantana. But I realize that your mission is more important, I will not let my inquisitiveness get in the way of this work.~ /*I suppose someone still has a copy of the recipe somewhere, but the more I witnessed the death and suffering in this place the less important discovering the leaven bread became.*/
@69 = ~I happen to have a recipe for leaven bread right here.~
@70 = ~Don't worry, Boddyknock. We'll find that recipe for you.~
@71 = ~This better not interfere with the work you're doing for me!~
@72 = ~NP: Really? That's, uh. this is marvelous! Yes, it's exactly what I needed! I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small trinket, but it's all I have. Before I left Lanthan, my master, Profiro, gave me a ring. He said it embodied the essence of the quest for discovery and the pursuit of knowledge...~ /*I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small token, perhaps, but it is all I have.*/
@73 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. But for now we must return to the task at hand. Aribeth is counting on you.~
@74 = ~Never fear, <CHARNAME>. My work with you will take precedence over my search for the leaven bread recipe.~
@75 = ~Because you have helped me in discovering the miracle of this leaven bread, I feel you have earned your right to wear this ring.~
@76 = ~Thank you, Boddyknock.~
@77 = ~That's it? A cheap ring?~
@78 = ~NP: The ring comes from the island of Lantana, an island of discovery and invention. It has the power to give insight to the wearer. I regret that I cannot do more for you, <CHARNAME>, but someday I will better thank you for all this goodness. But for now, we must direct our attention to more important business and take up your assignment. Aribeth is counting on you.~ /*The ring comes from the island of Lantan, island of discovery and invention. It has the power to grant insight to its wearer.*/
@79 = ~There is power in this ring, <CHARNAME>.~
@80 = ~NP: I believe that discovering a yeast dough for baking bread could do a lot of good, and one day I would bring the recipe to my home on Lantana. But I realize that your mission is more important, <CHARNAME>. I will not let my inquisitiveness get in the way of that work.~ /*I believe the discovery of the leaven bread recipe could have far reaching benefits, and I would like to someday be able to bring a copy back to my home of Lantan.*/
@81 = ~NP: What I said. those words were-- You disregarded things that are important to me, I don't want to talk about it anymore.~ /*Please... do excuse me. I worry so much for her safety, this is... difficult to talk about.*/
@82 = ~NP: My knowledge of the city is rather sparse, <CHARNAME>. My arrival coincidentally coincides with the beginning of the quarantine in Neverwinter. As for the plague itself, I hope to find a cure - or at least a way to prevent its spread. I have a theory as to how it might be done, if you'd like to hear it, of course.~ /*As for the plague itself, I was hoping to discover a cure - or at least a way to prevent the plague from spreading. I have a theory of how this might be accomplished, if you are interested in hearing it.*/
@83 = ~Tell me your theory.~
@84 = ~NP: Then I have no questions.~ /*That's all the questions I have.*/
@85 = ~All evidence seems to indicate that our mission is progressing in the proper direction. I can't imagine what other advice to give you at this time other than to continue in the same manner as we are.~
@86 = ~NP: Most types of plague have a very high fatality rate, but there are a few who defy it and survive even after contact with the sick. Something in their bodies prevents the symptoms of the disease from appearing. If we could isolate this characteristic from the organisms of the survivors, we could reproduce or pass it on to other organisms, thereby creating immunity to the disease in question.~ /*With most plagues fatality rates are extremely high, but there always a few who defy the odds and survive even after contracting the illness. Something within these individuals resists the symptoms of the disease.*/
@87 = ~Unfortunately I have yet to locate a single individual who has contracted this particular plague and survived. However, I would like to continue my examinations of the Beggar's Nest before I admit this problem has no solution.~
@88 = ~Why are you so interested in the Beggar's Nest?~
@89 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~
@90 = ~NP: All the reports I've gathered on the plague are that the Howling Death outbreak began in the Beggars' Nest. Logically, the best way to find survivors is to retrace the steps of the disease from its original source. I wouldn't be surprised to find survivors of the Howling Death in the Beggar's Nest.~ /*Logically the best chance of locating a survivor is to trace this epidemic back to its source. I would not be surprised to discover a few survivors of the Wailing Death in the Beggar's Nest district.*/
@91 = ~Did you ever investigate the Beggar's Nest on your own?~
@92 = ~NP: Even with the zeal with which I conduct my plague research, I'm not obsessed enough to lose my life over it. Beggar's Nest is crawling with zombies! Incidentally, the zombie invasion of Beggars Nest doesn't strike me as a mere coincidence. I suspect that there is more than a coincidental connection between the reanimated corpses on the streets and the plague outbreak.~ /*Incidentally, the zombie infestation in the Beggar's Nest struck me as more than mere coincidence. I suspect the animated corpses might be somehow linked to the outbreak of the plague itself.*/
@93 = ~NP: Of course I couldn't test this theory, as my chances of surviving a neighborhood overrun with zombies were slim to none. I can't think of anything else to tell you.~ /*Of course I was unable to test this theory, as my chances of survival on my own in a district overrun with zombies were virtually negligible.*/
@94 = ~If we're going to be traveling together I'd like to know a little more about you.~
@95 = ~I'd like you to continue your story from before, Boddyknock.~
@96 = ~NP: As you know, I come from Lantana, an island famous for its inventions and scientific achievements. From this you may rightly infer that I am analytical and inquisitive. You also know that I am a sorcerer, and from that you can no doubt deduce further - though it is true that my chosen profession is unusual in Lantan culture.~ /*As you know, I come from Lantan - an island renowned for its inventions and scientific advances. From that you can rightly conclude that I myself am of an analytical and curious nature.*/
@97 = ~Why are sorcerers so uncommon in Lantan?~
@98 = ~Did your family disapprove of your career choice?~
@99 = ~The mysteries of the arcane are not as eagerly sought out in my homeland as they are in other places. We have inventions to accomplish many of the things others rely on magic to perform.~
@100 = ~NP: My country is not ashamed of what I do. It just seems unusual, although I accept that this is not the future my father thought was best for me. I was his oldest son, and I assume my father wanted me to follow in his footsteps. But flowers, plants and gardens never really appealed to me.~ /*I was his eldest son, and I suppose my father wanted me to follow in his own footsteps. But flowers, plants and gardens never held much interest for me.*/
@101 = ~What was he - a druid?~
@102 = ~I don't blame you. Plants are boring.~
@103 = ~Your father wanted you to become a gardener?~
@104 = ~Druids worship nature, <CHARNAME>. But we in Lantan seek to control and direct nature; to extract that which is useful and remove that which is harmful.~
@105 = ~NP: Don't be afraid to overemphasize the importance of agrocultural studies, <FirstName>. There may be a lack of excitement in this field, but growing and caring for plants can definitely be rewarding. Druids worship nature, <CHARNAME>. But on Lanthan they seek to control and manage nature; to choose what is useful and remove what is harmful.~ /*Do not underestimate the value of agricultural research, <CHARNAME>. It may lack the excitement of adventuring, but the growing and tending of plants can be quite useful.*/
@106 = ~You sound like a druid.~
@107 = ~NP: Agronomy is a highly respected field of study in Lantana and my father was one of the best horticulturists on the island. He was a pioneer in the study of cross-pollination and grafting techniques, which gave rise to twenty-six unique plant varieties. Thanks to my father's work, the agricultural harvest on Lantana has increased, along with the supply of his medicinal herbs. And the beauty and diversity of our flower species cannot be compared to anything on the mainland.~ /*Agronomy is a well respected field in Lantan, and my father was one of the finest horticulturalists on the island. His pioneering research in cross-pollination and grafting techniques was responsible for the creation of twenty-six unique species of plants.*/
@108 = ~He sounds like a great man.~
@109 = ~Blah, blah, blah - who cares? We're talking about a bunch of stupid plants!~
@110 = ~A finer gnome could not be found the length and breadth of Faerun, <CHARNAME>. I suppose that is why I find the gulf that has grown between us so painful to accept.~
@111 = ~What do you mean?~
@112 = ~NP: I can see no logical reason for such hostility, <CHARNAME>. Nor can I find any reason why I should be subjected to it. Given your current mood, I see no reason why I should continue this conversation.~ /*I can see no logical reason for this hostility, <CHARNAME>. Neither can I see a reason why I should subject myself to it.*/
@113 = ~NP: My father and I... had a fight. Please, <CHARNAME>, it's hard for me to talk about it. Я... I'm not sure I want to discuss it with you right now. I might be in the mood to talk more about our history later, but right now we need to focus on the task at hand. The cult responsible for the Howling Death must be found.~ /*Perhaps later I will be in a mood to speak more of my tale, but for now we should focus on your mission. The cult responsible for the Wailing Death must be found.*/
@114 = ~NP: It's hard for me to talk about it, <CHARNAME>. What happened between my father and I... our fight. the memories of it hurt me. But maybe if I share them with someone, I can ease the pain and guilt I feel over what happened. That's a logical assumption, isn't it?~ /*But maybe if I share the tale with someone else I can ease some of the pain and guilt I feel over what happened. That is a logical assumption, isn't it?*/
@115 = ~NP: The days when my father explored land cultivation in agronomy are gone; he is an old man who is content to work in his own garden, living happily with family and friends. But even now he is given unfamiliar and exotic plants from distant lands to plant in his garden. It is said that in spring, when the flowers bloom in his father's yard, it becomes the most beautiful place in Lantana. And it is indeed his pride, his delight.~ /*My father's days of ground breaking research in agronomy are behind him, he is an old man content to putter in his own garden, happily living out his days among his friends and family.*/
@116 = ~Let me guess. You destroyed his garden?~
@117 = ~NP: I wish this was the only consequence of my actions, <CHARNAME>. My father asked me to tend the garden for a few weeks while he was visiting his friend on the other side of the island. Things went well for the first week. I found the work pleasant enough, though hardly stimulating to my spellcaster training. I even came up with a more efficient irrigation system to use when watering the plants.~ /*Everything went well the first week. I found the work enjoyable enough, though hardly as stimulating as my sorcerer's studies. I even came up with a more efficient watering system he could use on his plants.*/
@118 = ~But in the second week I noticed the beginning of a rot weed infestation.~
@119 = ~Rot weed? I've never heard of it.~
@120 = ~Gardens get weeds sometimes, Boddyknock - it's hardly your fault.~
@121 = ~NP: Rotting weed is a nasty, noxious creeping plant, with a disgusting acrid odor. If left undisturbed, it will devastate any garden in a matter of weeks, cutting off the life of any other plant. And worse, its roots release a powerful toxin into the ground, poisoning the soil so that for years nothing grows on that land. Like most unwanted garden guests, rotten weed is nearly impossible to kill.~ /*Even worse, the roots release a powerful toxin into the earth, poisoning the soil so nothing else will grow on the land for years. And, like most unwanted garden guests, rot weed is virtually impossible to kill.*/
@122 = ~I do not blame myself for the rot weed, <CHARNAME> - only in how I handled the infestation.~
@123 = ~NP: The only way to deal with a rotten weed is to use fire to burn right through its vines. If you can create a hot enough flame, the fire will penetrate the plant and burn its roots, killing the weed. I still remember from my childhood how my father used oil and torches to kill the rotten weed infestation - it was long and hard work because the vines are resistant to fire, and it's hard to create a hot enough flame to burn the roots as well.~ /*I still remember my father as a child using oil and torches to destroy a rot weed infestation - it was long and difficult work, for the vine is resistant to fire and it is difficult to make the flames hot enough to wither the roots.*/
@124 = ~NP: However, I wasn't worried about any of that when I came to the garden that morning. The infestation had just begun, and I had a secret weapon. After all, I am a sorcerer. Already imagining how pleased my father would be with the effectiveness of my method, I walked over to the weeds and fired a Burning Hands spell directly at the vine.~ /*However, I had no such worries as I went out to the garden that morning. The infestation had only just begun, and I had a secret weapon. After all, I was a sorcerer.*/
@125 = ~But something went wrong, didn't it?~
@126 = ~That probably wasn't the smartest thing to do. Magic shouldn't be trifled with.~
@127 = ~NP: I made the mistake of taking on the problem without having all the necessary information. My actions were logical in light of my knowledge, but I acted on a hypothesis that was fatally flawed. There was a reason my father used oil and torches to eliminate the infestation rather than enlisting the services of local mages. Magical fire destroys rotten weeds, but the intense heat causes the plants to explode violently.~ /*There was a reason my father used oil and torches to eliminate the infestation, rather than sending for the local mage. Magical fire destroys rot weed but the intense heat causes the plant to violently explode.*/
@128 = ~The vine burst, spewing out molten sap that ignited everything it touched. The roots ignited in the earth and columns of flame erupted from the soil, raining blazing bits of vegetation down all around me.~
@129 = ~Were you hurt?~
@130 = ~Exploding vegetation. I wish I could have been there.~
@131 = ~Miraculously I was unharmed by the conflagration, though the entire garden was soon ablaze. As was my father's house. And the houses of our neighbors on either side.~
@132 = ~No one was injured, and for that at least I am grateful. But by the time the fire brigade doused the flames all three houses were ruined - and my father's prize winning garden was nothing but ash.~
@133 = ~You burned down three homes and destroyed your father's garden? That's horrible!~
@134 = ~It was an accident, Boddyknock. You were only trying to help.~
@135 = ~You're supposed to look after a garden, and instead you torch three houses into ash? That's hilarious!~
@136 = ~NP: I am well aware of the terrible nature of my tragedy, <CHARNAME>, and what it cost my father. My father is not a poor man, so he was not angry with me for the compensation he had to pay the neighbors, or for the cost of a new house. But his garden was completely destroyed, and that is something he will never forgive me for.~ /*My father is a wealthy man, so he did not begrudge me the compensation he had to pay to his neighbors or the cost of replacing his own home. But his garden was utterly destroyed, and for that he has never forgiven me.*/
@137 = ~NP: It may have been an accident, <CHARNAME>, but that would in no way lessen the cost of this terrible tragedy. My father is not a poor man, so he was not angry with me for the compensation he had to pay the neighbors, or for the cost of a new house. But his garden was completely destroyed, and he will never forgive me for that.~ /*My father is a wealthy man, so he did not begrudge me the compensation he had to pay to his neighbors or the cost of replacing his own home. But his garden was utterly destroyed, and for that he has never forgiven me.*/
@138 = ~NP: Your callous mockery of my pain is as cruel as it is useless. I cannot understand what pleasure you find in the suffering of others. I refuse to discuss this further with you, <CHARNAME> - especially while you remain within the confines of an opinion so vicious and cruel! Let us return to our mission.~ /*I refuse to discuss this with you anymore, <CHARNAME> - not while you are in such a cruel and spiteful frame of mind! Let us just return to the mission at hand.*/
@139 = ~Maybe... mabye someday I can make it up to him, <CHARNAME>. Some gesture to heal the pain I have caused him.~
@140 = ~Such as?~
@141 = ~NP: Please. I don't wish to discuss it any further. The memories cause me too much pain. Perhaps later I'll be in the mood to talk more about our history, but for now we must focus on the task at hand. The cult responsible for the Howling Death must be found.~ /*Perhaps later I will be in a mood to speak more of my tale, but for now we should focus on your mission. The cult responsible for the Wailing Death must be found.*/
@142 = ~NP: The pain of what happened to my father, of how I destroyed the garden he spent his life growing, is a very personal pain, <CHARNAME>. But you're my friend, after all. I suppose the only logical assumption would be that you could help me with my father.~ /*The pain of what happened with my father, of how I destroyed the garden he had spent a lifetime cultivating, is a very personal pain, <CHARNAME>.*/
@143 = ~NP: What do you want from me?~ /*What do you want?!*/
@144 = ~This is between you and your father. I don't think I want to get involved.~
@145 = ~NP: I know I will never be able to recover all these plants and flowers that were in my father's garden, but perhaps if I do some significant act, he will find a way to forgive me. There was one flower in my father's life that he wanted to see more than any other, but that he never got around to finding.~ /*I know I can never replace the many varieties of plants and flowers that were once in my father's garden, but perhaps if I make a grand gesture he will find it in his heart to forgive me.*/
@146 = ~NP: I think logic is on your side, <CHARNAME>. This is a family matter, though I fear that without your help I will never be able to heal the rift between me and my father. I will stay with you as we search for the cult behind Howling Death, though if you decide you can help me in this matter of mine, talk to me again.~ /*I suppose you are right, <CHARNAME>. This is a family matter, though I fear without your help I may never be able to heal the breach between my father and myself.*/
@147 = ~Among the great library of Lantan there are accounts of the prism blossom; a living, growing flower whose petals are said change color and reflect light as they were made of crystal.~
@148 = ~So why don't you get him one of these prism blossoms?~
@149 = ~NP: You want to find a flower like that?~ /*We should search this place.*/
@150 = ~NP: Information about the flower appears in only one text, the travel notes of an explorer who died centuries ago after returning from a journey to the North. No one else has been able to find the place where this rare flower grows, nor its shimmering, crystal-like seeds, though many have devoted their lives to the search. Maybe the prism flower is only a myth, <FirstName>, but if I can find the seed of this flower and give it to my father, I am sure he will forgive me for ruining his garden.~ /*The account of the flower occurs in only one text - the travel diary of an explorer who died several centuries ago after returning from a journey to the North.*/
@151 = ~NP: I will not stop searching for the sectarians behind the plague; I have sworn to help you destroy those who have placed the vile stain of the Howling Death upon the world. But I still hope that during our journey we may come across the crystalline seeds of the prismatic flower.~ /*I will not abandon the search for the cultists behind the plague; I have pledged to aid you in destroying those who released the foul taint of the Wailing Death.*/
@152 = ~I have some strange seeds here. Are these what you're looking for?~
@153 = ~Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find the seeds you're looking for.~
@154 = ~Just don't let this get in the way of your other duties.~
@155 = ~NP: Let me see... Yes, these seeds look like they're made of glass. And their shape and size match the reports from the travel diary. That's fantastic! When I show them to my father, he will surely forgive me! Thank you, <CHARNAME>, but I'm afraid that word will be my only reward.~ /*Let me see... yes, these seeds do seem to be made of glass. And their shape and size are consistent with the accounts in the travel diary. You have done it, <CHARNAME>!*/
@156 = ~The reward you offer is greater than you know, Boddyknock.~
@157 = ~Great. That and a couple coppers will get me a mug of warm ale.~
@158 = ~You are a true friend, <CHARNAME>. With you by my side I'm certain we will somehow find the seeds of the prism blossom... if they still exist.~
@159 = ~Don't worry, <CHARNAME>. As much as I want to reconcile with my father, I understand that our mission is far more important. It would be illogical for me to let my own quest interfere with yours.~
@160 = ~Although I have no reward to repay you, <CHARNAME>, there may yet be some benefit to you for aiding me in this quest.~
@161 = ~NP: Lantanaean artifacts draw their energy from a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore. A momentous discovery may increase the powers of the ring I gave you earlier. But I'm not leaving you yet. Only after we discover the cult behind the Howling Death will I return to my homeland and present these seeds to my father.~ /*In any case, I thank you once again, <CHARNAME>. But I will not leave your side yet. Only after we have located the cult behind the Wailing Death will I return to my homeland and present these seeds to my father.*/
@162 = ~NP: Accept this ring, it comes from the island of Lantan, the island of discovery and invention. It has the power to give insight into the essence of things to the one who wears it. I regret that I cannot do more for you, <CHARNAME>, but someday I will better thank you for all this goodness.~ /*The ring comes from the island of Lantan, island of discovery and invention. It has the power to grant insight to its wearer.*/
@163 = ~Perhaps later I will be in a mood to speak more of my tale, but for now we should focus on your mission. The cult responsible for the Wailing Death must be found.~
@164 = ~NP: I have heard many rumors about where the cult might be hiding, but so far I have found no conclusive proof of my theories. If I were to present my hypothesis to you now, in the absence of any real information, I'm afraid it would be nothing more than pure speculation.~ /*If I were to tell you my hypothesis now, in the absence of any empirical data, I fear it would be nothing but a complete and utter guess.*/
@165 = ~NP: Sometimes you just have to rely on a sudden flash of intuition.~ /*So guess, Boddyknock. Sometimes you just need to go with a hunch.*/
@166 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@167 = ~NP: It's like, uh. on a hunch? I don't think you understand me. Without the information necessary for analysis, my assessment of the situation is a hypothesis with an unacceptable chance of error. But I am in your service, <CHARNAME>. If you are interested in my opinion, I would say that we should start our search in the Neverwinter Forest southeast of Port Llast.~ /*A... a hunch? I don't think you understand. Without the proper data to analyze my evaluation of the situation would result in a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin of error.*/
@168 = ~Why there?~
@169 = ~Then we should continue with your mission.~
@170 = ~NP: Roots, herbs, and other vegetation are abundant in the forests, and many of the plants can be used to heal various diseases. The only logical assumption is that harvesting these herbs can also be used to cause sickness or death. In addition, the most civilized part of the population avoids forests - they believe that forests are filled with various creatures - making the forest an indispensable hiding place for large groups of conspirators.~ /*Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.*/
@171 = ~The Neverwinter Wood seems to be the only place that provided the seclusion and the materials that would have been necessary for the cult to bring about the Wailing Death. At least, that's my best guess.~
@172 = ~Not bad, for a guess.~
@173 = ~Remember, <CHARNAME> - this theory is based entirely on speculation and can hardly be considered sound. The only way to test its veracity is to search the Neverwinter Wood for ourselves.~
@174 = ~I wouldn't mind knowing your thoughts on Aribeth's betrayal. How do you feel about it?~
@175 = ~NP: I look forward to the continuation of your story.~ /*You go on with you story then.*/
@176 = ~NP: Aribeth's betrayal doesn't make me the least bit uncomfortable. On the one hand, her actions seem irrational and illogical - she swore to destroy the city she spent her life defending. But on the other hand, is a warrior's vow to avenge the murder of her soulmate illogical? And what about Fentick's death that started this whole mess? His execution made no sense. He wasn't an enemy of the city and, if he were alive, he would have done everything in his power to help Neverwinter deal with all that he had done.~ /*Aribeth's betrayal has caused me no amount of confusion, <CHARNAME>. On the one hand, her actions appear irrational and illogical - she has vowed to destroy the city she spent her life protecting.*/
@177 = ~What purpose is there in killing a man who is only going to be your ally in the future? Such irrational behavior is difficult for me to understand, <CHARNAME>.~
@178 = ~Sometimes people let their emotions rule their actions, and we do foolish things.~
@179 = ~By the letter of the law Fenthick's actions were deserving of execution. The law has to be obeyed.~
@180 = ~Are you saying the people of Lantan never make poor decisions?~
@181 = ~NP: On Lantana we follow the law of common sense and logic. Emotions can never really be a major factor in our decision making, but we do our best to look at the facts with an open mind before we take any action. I believe that in this sense we are quite different from many other Fairun cultures. We will have to familiarize ourselves with these strange lands if we hope to integrate into the mainland community.~ /*In Lantan we bow to the laws of reason and logic. Emotion can never be truly factored out of any decision, but we do our best to look at the facts with a dispassionate eye before taking action.*/
@182 = ~NP: Lantan is an island, geographically we are isolated from the rest of the world. Over the centuries, this has led us to give birth to an island culture, especially among my people, the dwarves. We believe that isolation protects us from the dangers of the mainland. We were keen explorers of Feyroon's history, which suits the analytical mindset of ours. But we did not want to be active participants in the events.~ /*We consider ourselves safely removed from the troubles of the mainland. We have been fascinated observers of the history of Faerun, as befits our analytical mindset. But we chose not to be active participants in events.*/
@183 = ~Recently, however, our culture has embarked upon a radical journey of change, a revolutionary shift in our entire belief system. Soon, perhaps even in my own lifetime, Lantan will become an important part of life in the Realms.~
@184 = ~What are you talking about? Some kind of invasion?~
@185 = ~NP: We are thinkers, inventors and academics, <CHARNAME> - not soldiers. We plan to bring our culture and beliefs to Faerûn through peaceful means, though we intend to take rational and logical steps. We must study and analyze the current political and cultural realities in an organized and thorough manner before attempting to blend into the existing order. You know who we are, can we really be expected to do anything differently?~ /*Before we attempt to introduce ourselves into the existing order we must study and analyze the current political and cultural realities in an organized and thorough fashion. Could you expect anything less, given our nature?*/
@186 = ~Go on.~
@187 = ~Why the sudden change in ideology?~
@188 = ~NP: As you can imagine, a revolution of such significance must be precipitated by some startling event. Without a powerful catalyst, we are incapable of a powerful reaction. In our case, the catalyst is a single miraculous event - the day the god Gond the Miracle Worker appeared on the shores of Lantana in the guise of a mortal.~ /*As you can imagine a revolution of this magnitude must be precipitated by an astonishing event. Without a significant catalyst there cannot be a significant reaction.*/
@189 = ~Gods in mortal form? What are you talking about?~
@190 = ~You're referring to the Time of Troubles, aren't you?~
@191 = ~You have not heard of the Time of Troubles, <CHARNAME>? The days when the gods were forced to take mortal form and walk among us?~
@192 = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>; I am speaking of the Time of Troubles, when the gods were forced to take mortal form and walk among us.~
@193 = ~NP: I wish I could share a story with you, but the story of Gond the Wonderworker's coming to Lantan is very long, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps we will talk more about it later, but now is not the time. We should concentrate on our task at hand. We need to deliver the Words of Power to Aaryn Gendu.~ /*Perhaps I will speak more of this later, but now is not the time. We need to focus on our mission. We have to get those Words of Power back to Aarin Gend.*/
@194 = ~You seem quite interested in this subject, <CHARNAME>. I suppose we could spare a few minutes from our quest to speak about Gond's arrival on the shores of Lantan, if you wish.~
@195 = ~I wouldn't have asked if I didn't want to hear the tale.~
@196 = ~NP: Let's talk some other time.~ /*Let us speak of something else.*/
@197 = ~NP: Exactly. As I mentioned before, Gond the Miracle Worker appeared on the shores of Lantan during the Times of Unearth. At that time, Ao, the forefather of all gods, ordered them all to go to the people in the guise of mortals. Gond the Wonderworker took the form of a dwarf, a logical choice given the obvious advantages of my race. It was in this guise that he swam out onto the shores of Lanthan. As you can imagine, the people were skeptical of Gond's appearance, but the Miracle Worker's clerics confirmed his identity.~ /*Precisely. As I already mentioned, Gond Wonderbringer appeared on the shores of Lantan during the Time of Troubles. During those years Ao, the overfather of the Gods, decreed they must walk among us as mortals.*/
@198 = ~NP: In the Time of Adversity, a rivalry broke out between gods who had suddenly become mortal. Bane, Baal, and Myrculus began to battle each other for possession of death. Vokin, the goddess of prosperity and trade, disappeared and never reappeared. But Gond managed to stand aside from these machinations and the show of power by the other deities.~ /*Waukeen, goddess of wealth and commerce, vanished and has never returned. But Gond chose not to become involved in the machinations and power struggles of the other deities.*/
@199 = ~He dwelt peacefully among the people of my island home, sharing his wisdom and knowledge with us. Perhaps the most well known gift he shared with us was the secret of making smokepowder.~
@200 = ~Smokepowder?~
@201 = ~NP: Smoke powder is quite useful in case of danger. Although it looks like nothing more than coarse black sand, when ignited, smoky powder explodes with amazing force. Smoky gunpowder is a wonderful all-purpose tool, but in unskilled hands it can become very destructive. For this reason, even among the Lantaneans, the secret of smoky powder is known only to a few.~ /*Smokepowder is a remarkable tool with many uses, but it can be quite destructive in the wrong hands. This is why even among the Lantanese the secrets of smokepowder are known only to a precious few.*/
@202 = ~But even though smokepowder is Gond's most well known gift to my people, it was not the most important piece of knowledge he shared with us.~
@203 = ~NP: What do you mean? What other gift did he give you?~ /*What do you mean? What other gift did he give you?*/
@204 = ~Really? You mean you have something more powerful than smokepowder?~
@205 = ~NP: As I've told you before, we are a society of researchers and thinkers. We're used to isolating ourselves from politics and events in Feyroun. But Gond has changed all that. He has warned us that the time is coming when we will become involved in the affairs of the mainland. And the time is coming when we cannot afford to remain impassive and neutral.~ /*He warned us a time was coming when we must become involved in the affairs of the mainland. A time was coming in which we could not afford to remain dispassionate and neutral.*/
@206 = ~He would not say when this time was or what the circumstances would be of this momentus event. But when a god tells you to go forth into the rest of the world, you would be wise to listen.~
@207 = ~But Lantan is still a very closed and mysterious society.~
@208 = ~NP: Knowing the analytical nature of our society, you would never have expected us to suddenly unite with the rest of Feyroun without doing thorough research and study of what we were about to encounter. Suddenly the discoveries and reports of those who had spent years of research and exploration away from our island became extremely important as a tool to teach us about the social patterns and culture of those we were soon to encounter.~ /*Suddenly the discoveries and accounts of those who had left our island on journeys of exploration became infinitly more important as a tool to teach us of the society and culture we knew we would soon be interacting with.*/
@209 = ~Now, by law, all who leave Lantan must first visit the clerics of Gond Woderbringer to obtain divine guidance before embarking on their journey.~
@210 = ~NP: What other instructions?~ /*What fighting is that?*/
@211 = ~What kind of divine guidance did you receive?~
@212 = ~Me? Uh... you know, the usual. Go with Gond, that kind of thing. Pretty much what you'd expect.~
@213 = ~Boddyknock, are you keeping secrets from me?~
@214 = ~You're not a very good liar.~
@215 = ~NP: The instruction I received from the clerics of Gond is a personal and confidential thing, <CHARNAME>. And it has nothing to do with our work for Aarin Gond. Perhaps we'll talk more about it later, but now is not the time. We should be concentrating on our mission. We need to deliver the Words of Power to Aarin Gend.~ /*Perhaps I will speak more of this later, but now is not the time. We need to focus on our mission. We have to get those Words of Power back to Aarin Gend.*/
@216 = ~NP: Perhaps I should not have told you this, <CHARNAME>. But you have managed to prove yourself in my eyes many times already, and I am sure that even Gond himself would not forbid me to ask your help in this matter. I intend to pass on the secret information only to the people of Lantan and the Church of Gond the Miracle Worker. I am relying on you to keep this secret from being divulged.~ /*I probably shouldn't tell you this, <CHARNAME>. But you have proven yourself to me many times over, and I am certain not even Gond himself would begrudge me for asking your assistance in this matter.*/
@217 = ~As you know, <CHARNAME>, I left Lantan on a journey of discovery. What you might not have known was that my journey is also a holy pilgrammage in the service of Gond Wonderbringer. I have been charged with a task.~
@218 = ~A task?~
@219 = ~NP: I don't have time to help you. I have to go find the Words of Power.~ /*I don't have time to help you with any holy pilgrammage! I have to find the Words of Power.*/
@220 = ~I will not force you to aid me in this, <CHARNAME> - though I fear I will not succeed without your help. If you change your mind speak to me again. In the meantime, let us return to our mission.~
@221 = ~NP: Whenever any of my people settled on the mainland, the clerics of Gond prayed to the Miracle Worker, hoping to see that new and previously unseen miracle that travelers seek in their wanderings. In my case, the priests saw a terrible creature of incredible size and immense power - a monster unknown in my homeland. Only after consulting the texts in the Great Library did the priests realize that the vision before them was that of a dragon.~ /*In my case the priests saw a terrible creature of enormous size and great power - a monster unknown in my homeland. Only after consulting the texts in the great library did the priests understand the vision was of a dragon.*/
@222 = ~You have to bring back a dragon? That won't be easy.~
@223 = ~NP: Bringing the dragon would have been an impossible task, of course, and the clerics would have been fools to burden me with such a ridiculous vow. Instead, they ordered me to return with dragon scales. Through experimentation, research, and divination spells, we can learn much about these creatures from just one scale.~ /*Instead, they charged me to return with a dragon's scale. Through experimentation, study and magical divination we can learn much about these creatures from a single scale.*/
@224 = ~So you want me to find this scale for you?~
@225 = ~So we need to kill a dragon without using any spells or magical weapons?~
@226 = ~NP: I realize that the chances of defeating a dragon without spells or magical weapons are so slim to none that they shouldn't even be considered. However, there must be another way to obtain scales. Dragons occasionally come into conflict with other creatures, most notably giants and other dragons. In combat with this foe, a dragon can of course be injured and even killed.~ /*I realize the odds of defeating a dragon without spells or magical weapons are so minute as to be negligible. However,there may be another way to obtain the scale.*/
@227 = ~Logically we might expect to find a dragon scale that has been torn free or dislodged in one of these struggles. This is far more likely than killing a dragon ourselves without any magical aid whatsoever.~
@228 = ~So I guess you're off to search for some dragon caves.~
@229 = ~You better not be thinking about going in search of a dragon cave. You still work for me, remember?~
@230 = ~NP: Fear not, <CHARNAME>. All the while you seek the Words of Power, I am at your service. During my time with you, I have seen more wonders and known more fantastic adventures than almost all of my few people. When I return home, my reports will add to the treasury of knowledge of all Lanthan.~ /*In my time with you I have seen more wonders and experienced more fantastic adventures than all but a handful of my people. When I return home my accounts will enrich the knowledge of all Lantan.*/
@231 = ~I would be a fool to leave you now even if I thought I could find a dragon scale on my own.~
@232 = ~I have a dragon scale here. Will this do?~
@233 = ~Don't worry, Boddyknock. We'll find you a dragon scale somewhere.~
@234 = ~This quest better not interfere with your duty to me!~
@235 = ~NP: Yes, this is exactly what I've been looking for. The priests of Gond will be shocked when I return with this wonderful material! This is further proof that you are the best of friends, <CHARNAME>. Here, take this ring. It was given to me by the Clerics of the Miracle Worker before I left Lanthan.~ /*Yet again you have proven yourself to be the greatest of friends, <CHARNAME>. Here, take this ring. It was given to me by the clerics of the Wonderbringer before I left Lantan.*/
@236 = ~Nothing would please me more, <CHARNAME>. Except for locating the Words of Power for Aarin Gend.~
@237 = ~Never fear, <CHARNAME>. I understand the importance of your mission, and I will not pu my own needs ahead of it. That would be illogical.~
@238 = ~NP: Your help during my time in service to the Gonda church has been invaluable. It would just make sense for my worthy benefactor to receive a ring from the church for helping my mission.~ /*You have aided and guided me throughout my sojourn in the service of the Gond's church. The logical thing to do would be to give the church's ring to the <PRO_MANWOMAN> who aided me on my mission.*/
@239 = ~I thank you for this reward, Boddyknock~
@240 = ~I feel like I'm getting screwed in this deal.~
@241 = ~The ring has powerful magical properties which you must not underestimate. Now that I have fulfilled my quest I have no further need of the ring.~
@242 = ~What are you going to do now, Boddyknock?~
@243 = ~NP: In time, I will return to Lantan and deliver the dragon scales to the Church of Gond. I suspect it will be a most joyous homecoming: the people will consider me a hero. And it is all thanks to you, <CHARNAME>.~ /*I suspect it will be a most joyful home coming - I will be hailed as a hero among my people. And it is all because of you, <CHARNAME>.*/
@244 = ~I'm going to miss you, Boddyknock.~
@245 = ~So you're deserting me now?~
@246 = ~NP: After all your favors, <CHARNAME>, I am unlikely to leave you. No, the most rational action would be to stay with you until your mission is accomplished. My return to Lantan will have to wait until we find the Words of Power and return them to Aaryn Gendu. All the while you search for the Words, I will be with you.~ /*After all you have done for me I can hardly leave you now, <CHARNAME>. No, the only rational course of action would be to stay with you until your own mission is done.*/
@247 = ~NP: Fear not, <CHARNAME>. All the while you seek the Words of Power, I am at your service. During my time with you, I have seen more wonders and known more fantastic adventures than almost all of my few people. When I return home, my reports will add to the treasury of knowledge of all Lanthan. It would be foolish to leave you now, even if I could find the dragon scales myself.~ /*In my time with you I have seen more wonders and experienced more fantastic adventures than all but a handful of my people. When I return home my accounts will enrich the knowledge of all Lantan.*/
@248 = ~Perhaps I will speak more of this later, but now is not the time. We need to focus on our mission. We have to get those Words of Power back to Aarin Gend.~
@249 = ~I doubt I can help you there, <CHARNAME>. All I know of this area is limited to the accounts of Lantanese explorers detailing the hills to the north of Beorunna's well.~
@250 = ~Tell me about these reports.~
@251 = ~NP: As you know, a love of exploration and a thirst for exploration are traits common to all Lantanese. Whenever one of our people visits a foreign country, they make a report of their travels. These reports are given to the Great Library of Lantan so that they can be consulted by all residents. A few years ago, a dwarf named Erigo the Wanderer returned to our island with a report on the area.~ /*These accounts are added to the Great Library of Lantan so that all our people can be enlightened. A few years ago a gnome named Herigo Wanderlust returned to my island with his account of this region.*/
@252 = ~As you wish. We should probably continue with your mission in any case.~
@253 = ~The majority of his time was spent exploring the hills to the north of Beorunna's Well, secretly observing the habits and activities of the giants who make their home there.~
@254 = ~Giants?~
@255 = ~NP: Oh, yes. We don't have giants on Lanthan, so my people have been fascinated by them. The most detailed account of them is Erigo's research, from what we have. The subject of his research was the hill giants, if I remember correctly, they chose a king among their kind, and that king united the disparate groups of giants into a single powerful tribe.~ /*The subjects he was studying - hill giants were the exact species, if I remember correctly - had actually chosen a king from among their numbers, and this king had united several bands of giants into a single powerful tribe.*/
@256 = ~They had even constructed a great steading to house the king, and from there they raided the lands to the south. Until Herigo's research we assumed hill giants to be incapable of such high level organization.~
@257 = ~Anything else?~
@258 = ~NP: Much of Erigo's research was scientific in nature: diet, mating, activity cycles, natural habitat and territory sizes. The research is carefully compiled, by academic standards, but I'm afraid it's useless for your purposes. I'm afraid there's nothing more I can tell you, <CHARNAME>. In any case, we had better continue our search for the Words of Power.~ /*Most of Herigo's research was of a scientific nature - diet, mating habits, activity cycles, habitat and territory range. Academically compelling, but hardly useful in your mission, I'm afraid.*/
@259 = ~<CHARNAME>, a moment if I may. I have something to say to you, and I'm afraid that if I don't say it now I may not get the chance.~ [Boddhi]
@260 = ~Yes, Boddyknock - what is it?~
@261 = ~Not now, Boddyknock! I'm kind of busy here!~
@262 = ~NP: All indications are that the final battle with Morag is just around the corner, and there is something you need to know. I left my native Lanthan to make discoveries, to experience all that the world had to offer me. In our time together, I have seen wonders I could never have imagined and had adventures I still cannot believe.~ /*I left my home of Lantan on a journey of discovery, eager to experience all the world had to offer. In our time together I have seen wonders I could not have imagined and experienced adventures I can barely believe myself.*/
@263 = ~Yes, I understand. All evidence points to the conclusion that our final confrontation is near at hand. If you don't want to hear what I have to say then I'll keep my observations to myself.~
@264 = ~I'm sorry. Please go on.~
@265 = ~Good, keep quiet. We've got business to take care of!~
@266 = ~I left my home of Lantan on a journey of discovery, eager to experience all the world had to offer. In our time together I have seen wonders I could not have imagined and experienced adventures I can barely believe myself.~
@267 = ~Onward, then. I'll follow you as I always do.~
@268 = ~But what still amazes me most through all of this, <CHARNAME>, is you yourself. The legend you have forged in the North, all the great deeds you have accomplished - I admit that at times I am somewhat in awe of you.~
@269 = ~I didn't do it alone. You have been a valuable ally throughout my adventures.~
@270 = ~*Sigh* I guess people holding me in awe is the burden of being a hero.~
@271 = ~Get to the point, Boddyknock.~
@272 = ~I may have had some small hand in this, <CHARNAME>, but make no mistake: you are the true hero here, not me. Yours is the name the history chronicles will remember... if we survive the coming battle.~
@273 = ~NP: I want you to know that I am proud to be a part of this, even if my role is small. It's not often that a simple dwarf from a tiny island like mine becomes part of a legend yet to be written. If we get out of this alive, I can return to Lanthan with wonderful stories and tales that will be the envy of everyone on my home island. And I have you, <CHARNAME>, to thank for that.~ /*If we get out of this alive I'll be able to return to Lantan with marvelous tales; stories that will be the envy of everyone on my island home. I've got you to thank for that, <CHARNAME>.*/
@274 = ~I don't know what fate has in store for us, or if we even have a chance in this coming battle. But I'm with you to the end, <CHARNAME>. You can count on me.~

@276 = ~NP: Hold on, dwarf. Our work here isn't done yet.~ /*Save it, gnome. Our work here isn't done.*/

I just thought it should be said before - well, before we go to fight Morag. Go on, then. I'll follow you, as always.~ /*Yes, well... I know this wasn't really the best time for this. Hardly logical for me to get all sentimental on you now, is it? But I just felt it needed to be said before - well, before we go up against Morag.*/
@278 = ~NP: Of course you're right. I just, uh. I just thought it should be said before... Well, before we go and fight Morag. Go on, then. I'll follow you, as always.~ /*You're right, of course. I just... I just felt it needed to be said before... well, before we go up against Morag.*/
