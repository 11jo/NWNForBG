@0 = ~What can an old farmer do for you, m'<LADYLORD>?~
@1 = ~What's your name?~
@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~I need some directions.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Me? I'm Farmer O'Deel but you can just call me Pete, if you like. An' who might you be?~
@6 = ~You may call me <CHARNAME>.~
@7 = ~No matter what my name is, our squad is led by <CHARNAME>.~
@8 = ~Sorry, I generally don't give out my name.~
@9 = ~Sorry, I have to keep an eye on my cattle. No time for distractions.~
@10 = ~How many cattle do you have?~
@11 = ~Yes, on your way, then. Well met.~ /*Yes, on your way, then.*/
@12 = ~Very well. <CHARNAME> it is, then. I've been having some trouble around the farm as of late... Think you'd be fit to help out?~
@13 = ~What troubles you tell of?~
@14 = ~This does not interest me. Goodbye.~ /*I'm not interested. Goodbye.*/
@15 = ~As you wish. I've been having some trouble around the farm as of late, m'<LADYLORD>... Think you'd be of a mind to help me out?~
@16 = ~Less than I had a few weeks ago, admittedly. The herd's run into some bad trouble, lately.~
@17 = ~There are some dire wolves in the hills there that have taken to preying on my herd. The pack's led by a big she-wolf I've taken to calling Silverback... I swear I'll pay 500 gold to have her head. She's already taken down two of my cattle and, left to her own devices, she'll clear the whole herd.~ /*I swear I'll pay 300 gold to have her head. She's already taken down two of my cattle and, left to her own devices, she'll clear the whole herd.*/
@18 = ~Sure, that sounds like something I could do.~
@19 = ~Sorry, it doesn't sound like high adventure...~
@20 = ~Actually, that she-wolf is already dead.~
@21 = ~Well I didn't kill Silverback but I did speak with her...~
@22 = ~I want to know the details.~
@23 = ~That be true? Well I won't hold my breath 'til the damn wolf is dead, but the help's appreciated. Until then, need anything else?~
@24 = ~Where do I find these wolves again?~
@25 = ~Mind if I ask you a few more questions?~
@26 = ~I'll be back after I find the wolf.~
@27 = ~No. It seems like too much trouble.~
@28 = ~I reckoned as much. If you'll excuse me, then, m'<LADYLORD>, I've got a herd to watch over.~
@29 = ~By the gods, <MANWOMAN>, so you do! Bravo! I imagine that could not have been a simple task! I assume the 500 gold as a reward will be sufficient, yes?~
@30 = ~That'll do, Pete. That'll do.~
@31 = ~I think I've earned a higher reward than that.~
@32 = ~More money, fool, or I'll have your head, too!~
@33 = ~No reward necessary. The joy of the hunt was reward enough.~
@34 = ~You what!? Bah, who am I to argue. I've been known to talk to my cows on occasion... Still, wolves are predators. What makes you think they'll stop?~
@35 = ~She gave me her word. She'll stick to it.~
@36 = ~Well, then I'll go and kill her...~
@37 = ~Find someone else, then, because I'm not killing her...~
@38 = ~Sure thing. What do you want to know?~
@39 = ~Where can I find these wolves?~
@40 = ~That's not a lot of money for a job like this.~
@41 = ~What kind of threat do these wolves pose?~
@42 = ~There's a cave entrance just south of my farm. That's where they den. Now, is there anything else? Or are you going to bring me the head as you promised?~
@43 = ~I'm not really in the mood to talk. I've still got to protect my cattle from the wolves. Now, is there anything else? Or are you going to finish off the wolves as you promised?~
@44 = ~That's good to hear. Return when you have the head and I'll give you your reward.~
@45 = ~As you wish, <SIRMAAM>, though it's a shame you don't have the heart to help a simple dairy farmer.~
@46 = ~Thanks for the help, then. With the she-wolf gone, the rest of the pack should be easy enough to scatter. It's been appreciated. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again, m'<LADYLORD>.~ /*Thanks for the help, then. With the she-wolf gone, the rest of the pack should be easy enough to scatter. It's been appreciated.*/
@47 = ~True, maybe the pelts aren't worth as much as I led you to believe. Here, 675 gold is all I have. The herd'll recover in a few years.~
@48 = ~The wolf pelts may be heavy but they'll be worth gold enough when you make it back to town. I can't give you more than 500 gold pieces. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again.~
@49 = ~Would you toss away a man's life so easily? Satisfy yourself with your loot, fiend, and the 500 gold I promised you... Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd.~
@50 = ~Then you are more than kind, m'<LADYLORD>. If only there were more such as you, a farm like this could maybe still turn a profit. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again, m'<LADYLORD>.~ /*Then you are more than kind, m'<LADYLORD>. If only there were more such as you, a farm like this could maybe still turn a profit.*/
@51 = ~Very well, then. It may be against my better judgment but I suppose I trust you... I assume the 300 gold we discussed is sufficient?~
@52 = ~Well I don't trust her and I don't trust you, either, <SIRMAAM>! As long as Silverback is alive, you won't get any coin from me.~
@53 = ~There's a cave entrance just south of my farm. There are always a couple of them pacing in front.~
@54 = ~All right, that's enough information to make a decision on.~
@55 = ~Perhaps so but I'm not a wealthy man. There's not much money in cattle these days, and less when you're losing your herd to wolves... But those are some nice-looking wolves, if that's any consolation. At the very least, those pelts might be worth something if you brought 'em to town...~
@56 = ~Well I'll warn you now, they aren't your everyday timber wolves. Dire wolves are a lot tougher and a lot more cunning. Smarter than old Ingo's boy at any rate...~
@57 = ~You'll help? You'll kill Silverback and her pack?~
@58 = ~Aye? Something amiss, traveler?~
@59 = ~So you have returned! Have you good news? Have you the head of the she-wolf, Silverback?~
@60 = ~I really must be on my way to tell the missus. And I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again.~
