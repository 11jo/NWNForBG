@1 = ~Are you Quint Jhareg?~
@2 = ~Didn't we meet before?~
@3 = ~Be at peace. I come as the Judge.~
@4 = ~Why do the undead walk these halls?~
@5 = ~You are a madman, that much is clear.~
@6 = ~NP: Quint - quint, quintessence, Quint. But not Jareg, not anymore. I don't want to, I'm ashamed to dishonor my father's name..... Did you see the ghost stealing children in the village? That was me! You see, guilt is a gift that is given over and over and over and over again.~ /*Did you see a ghost stealing children from the village? That was me! Guilt is the gift that keeps on giving, you see, over and over and over.*/
@7 = ~Tell me more...~
@8 = ~Get to the point.~
@9 = ~Could you excuse me for a moment?~
@10 = ~We have and haven't, hadn't and had. Maybe it was my ghost you saw, counting woes... those I created and those that created me, yes?~
@11 = ~You? You'll be my Judge? But I'm not ready, I've just begun a new stage of my punishment! I'm going mad, you know. It helps me feel the pain more clearly...~
@12 = ~They're here to punish me, to remind me of what I've done, to remind me of what my brother almost was. I stopped one corpse and created more!~
@13 = ~Yes, clear, isn't it? The madness makes the pain more clear. It's a calculated madness, self-inflicted, and no defense, no defense, no defense, you hear?~
@14 = ~Blood on the pages where I read to them... Every one of them died, every child... I've gone quite mad, you know. Quite quintessentially mad... I was too early and too late, you see? The children were dead but I stopped my brother from joining them at least!~ /*Blood on the pages where I read to them... Every one of them died, every child... I've gone quite mad, you know. Quite quintessentially mad...*/
@15 = ~I stole it, I stole his phylactery, and I ran, oh how I ran from him, lips full of prayer. I gave it to Lathander, you know, for him to destroy. But it was already too late. He didn't destroy, he just tucked it away, tucked all of us away between the folds of time.~ /*I stole it, I stole his phylactery, and I ran, oh how I ran from him, lips full of prayer. I gave it to Lathander, you know, for him to destroy.*/
@16 = ~I've got a few more questions.~
@17 = ~Will you give that as a written oath?~
@18 = ~I've spoken to Karlat. He tells a different story.~
@19 = ~This your journal?~
@20 = ~I read to the children and saw them die. But not Karlat, no. I stole his phylactery, I gave it to Lathander to destroy but all for naught.~
@21 = ~Take a moment or take a lifetime, it's all the same in here. I'll forget we've even spoken.~
@22 = ~And I have answers! But are they to your questions, we'll just have to see...~
@23 = ~You seem eager to confess...~
@24 = ~What role did your brother play in this?~
@25 = ~NP: Do you know what this phylactery is?~ /*Do you know what a phylactery is?*/
@26 = ~What Judgment do you long for?~
@27 = ~All right, enough questions.~
@28 = ~Will the punishments of the Abyss be harsher than here in Limbo? Will I have a retinue of demons to lash me as I walk? If so, I yearn for it... Take my written oath of every word I've uttered here. Present it to the Guardian and stand in Judgment.~ /*Will the punishments of the Abyss be harsher than here in Limbo? Will I have a retinue of demons to lash me as I walk?*/
@29 = ~Of course he does. He protects me and he longs for his phylactery... Half alive, half dead... All any of us want is the whole of something. I have given you my story. Let him give you his. You are the Judge, not us.~ /*Of course he does. He protects me and he longs for his phylactery... Half alive, half dead... All any of us want is the whole of something.*/
@30 = ~My - my journal? I wasn't mad back then, it was before the crime. Everything was different, what bearing could it have? It says nothing!~
@31 = ~You loved the children.~
@32 = ~You thought it was going to be a party.~
@33 = ~You said your brother was acting strangely.~
@34 = ~You're right, it doesn't say anything.~
@35 = ~Confess ten times and it becomes a habit. Confess a hundred times, it becomes an obsession... Confess forever and it becomes your destiny...~
@36 = ~Karlat? He wanted death, he wanted everything. I stole it from him, of that I am sure. I stole death from all of us...~
@37 = ~Yes! It is like a jewel in how it glistens, like a corpse in how it feels. I touched it, I stole it, I gave it away. It is an abomination of the undead, a trap for the soul! I - I sought to destroy it but instead I destroyed us all...~ /*It is an abomination of the undead, a trap for the soul! I - I sought to destroy it but instead I destroyed us all...*/
@38 = ~Do what you will with me. I have my punishments planned from here unto eternity and plenty in between... But destroy the phylactery! Destroy it, that is all I ask! Maybe then the souls of this place can know Lathander's peace once more.~ /*But destroy the phylactery! Destroy it, that is all I ask! Maybe then the souls of this place can know Lathander's peace once more.*/
@39 = ~Yes, and just enough answers!~
@40 = ~I - I did... I read them stories and we would laugh and play... They loved coming here and now they're trapped here forever.~
@41 = ~That's all it said. Will you give that as a written oath?~
@42 = ~Yes, a glorious party! No blood, no undead brother, no phylactery, no corpses. I meant well... I didn't mean for this all to happen.~
@43 = ~He consorted with demons. I knew that but... I wanted this to be a happy place... I shouldn't have brought children to a house of demons! See? It is my fault, my crime! A crime of negligence, a crime of blindness, a crime of folly! I am guilty, a million times guilty.~ /*See? It is my fault, my crime! A crime of negligence, a crime of blindness, a crime of folly! I am guilty, a million times guilty.*/
@44 = ~No, nothing of use. It is all too late. Too early and too late for all the children. Take my oath, Judge, and grant me my punishment.~
@45 = ~All of us with faces dour, waiting for the Judgment hour!~ [NWQUI051]
@46 = ~Judge, you grant me the suffering I have begged of Lathander for so long. For each child, I shall travel anew into the Abyss to do my penance.~
@47 = ~I did, Judge! Never will I forgive myself!~
@48 = ~At last, the madness ends... The phylactery has brought nothing but evil to this house.... Come, brother. Now we both can rest...~
@49 = ~You are wiser than I surmised, my Judge... We deserve nothing more than this endless penance...~
@50 = ~We await your decision, Judge.~ [NWQUI051]
