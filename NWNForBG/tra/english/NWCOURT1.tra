@0 = ~Hello there, sugar. Something ye need?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Hah! I suppose none of the lads would mind if I chatted for a moment.~
@4 = ~Tell me about this place?~
@5 = ~Can you tell me about Luskan?~
@6 = ~Do you know of any work I might find?~
@7 = ~Where would I find Oreth?~
@8 = ~Where would I find Rhaine?~
@9 = ~Going so soon?~
@10 = ~Don't get lost, now.~
@11 = ~There's not much to tell. Miss Bela would be the one to ask, I'd think.~
@12 = ~You're one of the brothel girls, then?~
@13 = ~I'd like to hire you.~
@14 = ~How is it the brothel is still open?~
@15 = ~Tell me about Miss Bela.~
@16 = ~Let me ask you something else.~
@17 = ~NP: You're not from Luskan, are you? What do you want to know?~ /*You're a stranger, are you? What do you want to know?*/
@18 = ~What is all this fighting about?~
@19 = ~Do you know anything about cults in the city?~
@20 = ~When did the fighting begin?~
@21 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@22 = ~NP: Work? Ha ha... Our city's practically under siege, and you're looking for a job? Although, uh. everybody wants to make money. I don't know. If you want to keep yourself busy, maybe you should talk to Yvette or Erb... Especially Yvette. poor thing. Yvette is in her room, of course. Miss Bela let her get some rest. As for Erb. if you really want to see him, he's hanging around the salon.~ /*Yvette's off in her room, of course. Miss Bela gave her some time off, thankfully. As for Erb... well, if you really want to, you'll find him wandering about the lounge, here.*/
@23 = ~NP: Looking for Oret? So...of course he's in his bedroom. Oret doesn't entertain guests like most of us. Ever since the war started, he's been "reserved" for the High Captains themselves... Even though he didn't want to. There's nothing he or Miss Bela can do about it.~ /*Since all this fighting started, he's been 'reserved' for the High Captains... and not by choice. There's nothing he nor Miss Bela can do about that, though.*/
@24 = ~NP: Rain is in her bedroom. But she doesn't entertain guests like most of us, if that's what you meant. Since the war started, Rayne has been "reserved" for the High Captains themselves. But not by her choice... Neither she nor Miss Bela can do anything about it.~ /*Since this war began, Rhaine's been 'reserved' for the High Captains themselves. Not by choice, either... though there's nothing she nor Miss Bela can do about that.*/
@25 = ~Well... we used to have five High Captains who ran the city. Nobody knows why, but they began a war to determine which of them would be the last one standing... if they don't burn down Luskan first.~
@26 = ~Do you know anything else about it?~
@27 = ~NP: Cults? No, I've never been told anything about such a thing. Though there could be a dozen cults here in Luskan and no one would notice. Do you have any more questions?~ /*Cults? No, I haven't heard anything about such a thing. Although here in Luskan there could be a dozen cults and they might go unseen.*/
@28 = ~Only a few weeks ago, I think. It was very sudden. Three of the High Captains have disappeared or died... or so the rumors go.~
@29 = ~What do you want to know?~
@30 = ~Well... some say that the Arcane Brotherhood is behind it all. They're a bunch of wizards out in the Host Tower on the island off the shore, but nobody knows much about them. That includes me.~
@31 = ~NP: It's me. As you realize, it's crowded, so you'll have to wait your turn. Soldiers usually don't have to wait in line. unfortunately. So you'll probably have to wait longer. There's nothing you can do about it.~ /*The soldier boys tend to take their turn whenever they want, too... unfortunately. So you may be waiting longer than you like. Nothing we can do about that.*/
@32 = ~My, but aren't you a strange one? I'd love to accomodate you, my dear, but I've got a line of customers a mile long. Another time.~
@33 = ~Because the High Captains want it open. They can send their boys here to relax and demand whatever they like from Miss Bela.~
@34 = ~What they demands?~
@35 = ~Hah! Miss Bela is a kind soul, really. She's kept us all safe, so far. I hope this fighting ends soon... it's been quite a stress on her.~
@36 = ~Fine, fine, go ahead.~
@37 = ~Gold, naturally. As well as the use of whichever courtesans they wish... for whatever purposes they like.~
@38 = ~Something ye wanted, hun?~
