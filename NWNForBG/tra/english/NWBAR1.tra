@0 = ~Get you a drink, <PRO_SIRMAAM>? We've got a fine selection of beverages if you're interested.~
@1 = ~Yeah, I'll have a drink.~
@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~There's a lot of soldiers here. You wouldn't be selling drinks to them while they're on duty, would you?~
@4 = ~I think I'll pass.~
@5 = ~Let me show you what we've got.~
@6 = ~NP: Oh, understandable. A person who sells booze, like by itself, should know everything about everything here, right? Well, I don't have the time or inclination to poke my nose into the shady dealings of my drunken patrons. I sell booze. I am a barmen. Don't add or subtract, and I'm fine with that. So, do you want a drink or not?~ /*Oh, I get it. A man selling drinks is automatically the information hub of the community, right? Well, I don't have the time or the inclination to pry my drunken customers about their dark secrets.*/
@7 = ~I'll have a drink now.~
@8 = ~NP: What? No, it wouldn't occur to me to sell drinks to soldiers on duty. If I do this, my license will be taken away, and that's it - I'll go broke! No need to spread such gossip around the district,<LADYLORD> even as a joke. After all, this is my daily bread.~ /*What? No, I'd never sell a drink to a soldier on duty. They'd take my license if I did that - I'd be ruined!*/
@9 = ~Give me 50 gold or I'll tell everyone you're serving soldiers on duty and run you out of business!~
@10 = ~Sorry. Forget I even mentioned it.~
@11 = ~Then quit bothering me. Can't you see I'm swamped?~
@12 = ~NP: What? You mean... is it a racket? I thought I'd never see anyone like that again when I left Westgate! You are as disgusting as those damn Night Masks! Okay - here's your gold. But now that I've given you the money, you'll have to leave me alone! Get out of here! And never come to my bar again!~ /*What? You mean... this is a shakedown? I thought I'd gotten away from this kind of extortion when I left Westgate! You're as bad as those damn Nightmasks!*/
@13 = ~NP: Of course. Let's pretend like nothing happened. May I offer you a drink?~ /*Of course, my good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. It's as if it never happened. Now, can I get you a drink?*/
@14 = ~I'll be going now.~
@15 = ~You again? Look, I've already paid you off once - I can't afford to give you another 50 gold! You can't get blood from a stone.~
@16 = ~If I wanted to deal with these kind of constant shakedowns I would have stayed in Westgate and given my gold to the Nightmasks. So go on, you - get out of here.~
@17 = ~NP: I need a room.~ /*I have need of aid.*/
@18 = ~I was just leaving.~
