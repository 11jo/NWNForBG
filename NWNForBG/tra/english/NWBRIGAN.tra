@0 = ~By Jiminy, how many of you are in there? You must be friends of good man Desther.~ [NWBRIG56]
@1 = ~I had some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~A touch daft, are you? No matter. Well I reckon a few questions won't harm an old fella like myself... Helm protect me if I be wrong.~ /*Well I reckon a few questions won't harm an old fella like myself... Helm protect me if I be wrong.*/
@4 = ~NP: So you know Dester?~ /*So you know this Des-ter guy, yuh?*/
@5 = ~What is this place?~
@6 = ~Travel well...~
@7 = ~'At I do. I first met good man Desther the night of Shieldmeet. He must be an important fella, 'cause the whole place shut down when he left for Neverwinter. Now that he's back, mebbe things'll start gettin' back to normal 'round here.~ /*'At I do. I first met good man Desther the night of Shieldmeet. He must be an important fella, 'cause the whole place shut down when he left for Neverwinter.*/
@8 = ~Shieldmeet. What's that?~
@9 = ~NP: Why did you decide that everything here was &quot;closed&quot;?~ /*Why do you think the place "shut down?"*/
@10 = ~You're sure Desther's back?~
@11 = ~Why, this here's the road up to Helm's Hold, where all the priests live. There's no better lord than a Helmite, I say, 'cause they'll always protect you in hard times. Neverwinter's in the other direction - at least it would be if good man Desther hadn't had me get my ox and... I prob'ly shouldn't of said that...~ /*Why, this here's the road up to Helm's Hold, where all the priests live. There's no better lord than a Helmite, I say, 'cause they'll always protect you in hard times.*/
@12 = ~"Good man" Desther's a traitor. Lord Nasher sent me to hunt him down.~
@13 = ~Why, it's a plantin' festival for folks like me. For the Helmites, though, they come to the keep and figger out how to protect us over the comin' year. Priests an' paladins get reassigned all over. If they're in Baldur's Gate one year, they're in Neverwinter the next.~ /*Why, it's a plantin' festival for folks like me. For the Helmites, though, they come to the keep and figger out how to protect us over the comin' year.*/
@14 = ~Anything strike you as odd this Shieldmeet?~
@15 = ~Fear o' the plague, I reckon. Not very befittin' of Helm, if you ask me, but mebbe stayin' in all the time helps 'em protect us, somehow.~
@16 = ~NP: How do you know they didnt all die of the plague?~ /*How you know they not dead?*/
@17 = ~Right as rain. I was headin' down to catch some riverfish for tomorrow's supper when he and his priest friends showed up right where you're standin' now.~
@18 = ~Which way did he go?~
@19 = ~By Jiminy, you're serious? Now I *told* my wife there was something funny 'bout good man Desther. When he left for Neverwinter, he had me and my ox tear down the bridge behind him. He said it was to protect me from plague-bearers breaking quarantine.~ /*When he left for Neverwinter, he had me and my ox tear down the bridge behind him. He said it was to protect me from plague-bearers breaking quarantine.*/
@20 = ~Aye, I remember wakin' up to hear shouts and the sound of fightin' comin' from the keep. Just thought the priests were in their cups after all the festivities. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*Aye, I remember wakin' up to hear shouts and the sound of fightin' comin' from the keep. Just thought the priests were in their cups after all the festivities.*/
@21 = ~I'm still makin' deliveries there, though they're not going through as much as they used to. They ain't coming to the gate no more, either. I leave a half-stocked wagon outside the keep every week an' they leave me an empty one to swap to, with enough gold to make it worth my while.~ /*I leave a half-stocked wagon outside the keep every week an' they leave me an empty one to swap to, with enough gold to make it worth my while.*/
@22 = ~NP: Directly to the fortress - this is the only road along which you can go. Is there anything else you would like to know?~ /*Up to the keep - The only way anyone can go, now that the bridge is out.*/
@23 = ~Why, that was a fine bridge, too. My father built it and I'm the fool who tore it down... Toadstools!! Jiminy, you can't even trust your neighbors these days. That's it, I'm not taking a chance on nobody no more. Do what you want. I'm leaving.~ /*Jiminy, you can't even trust your neighbors these days. That's it, I'm not taking a chance on nobody no more. Do what you want. I'm leaving.*/
@24 = ~NP: It was a very good bridge. My father built it, and I, an idiot, destroyed it... What an infection!!! Jiminy, you cant even trust your own neighbors these days. Enough, I will never take that risk again and trust no one.~ /*Jiminy, you can't even trust your neighbors these days. That's it, I'm not taking a chance on nobody no more. Do what you want. I'm leaving.*/
@25 = ~Good man Desther told me there might be trouble... Guess you're it.~
