@0 = ~What do you want here? I've got nothing you couldn't get elsewhere. Please leave me.~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I can't stop you asking. Just hurry up so I can lock and block the door again.~
@4 = ~I wanted to ask about the Beggar's Nest.~
@5 = ~Can you tell me anything about the zombies?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~How good is security in the district?~
@8 = ~Goodbye, then. Please, try not to lead anything here, plague or otherwise.~
@9 = ~I can try to answer, if you wish. I don't know what I can offer that you couldn't find somewhere else.~
@10 = ~Has the effect of the plague been bad here?~
@11 = ~Are there any safe places?~
@12 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@13 = ~I know they are gone, and that's enough for me. I don't care who or what got rid of them, but I'm grateful.~
@14 = ~I don't want to know anything about any walking dead. That is just... it's not right!~
@15 = ~When did they first start showing up?~
@16 = ~I haven't left my home in days... longer, maybe. I don't dare go outside. I'll be dead if I do. I know it.~
@17 = ~The last person to ask me that robbed me blind. If this is a roundabout way of threatening me, don't waste your time. I've nothing to give you.~
@18 = ~I mean, at least the zombies seem to have gone away, but the plague is still there... I can't see it, but I know it's there.~
@19 = ~I'm no fighter, no guard. That's the walking dead out there. At least I can see them, I suppose. Not like the plague.~
@20 = ~Anything strange besides the plague and undead then?~
@21 = ~NP: Never... It never even occurred to me to think what could be more unusual than what happened to us here. I guess... There seemed to be some strange people... but no one who could compare to this undead army. Gang...~ /*Never... I never thought I would dare consider there was something more strange than what has happend to us here.*/
@22 = ~What do you know about the gang?~
@23 = ~NP: The Sword Coast Boys, that's what they call themselves. Some nice guys have contacted them... they will all end up on the gallows. Drol is worse than all of them. The rest... just kids. They seem to spend most of their time in the northwestern part of the Nest.~ /*The Sword Coast Boys are what they call themselves. Some good children fell in with them... now they'll end up in stocks.*/
