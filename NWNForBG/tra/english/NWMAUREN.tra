@0 = ~Pardon my improper greeting, <SIRMAAM>, but I really can't muster the interest today. The plague picks us off one by one, and I can't even hide in my home. The Peninsula is all but overrun by escaped criminals. We've lost everything to them. Why doesn't anybody do something about it?~ /*Pardon my improper greeting, <SIRMAAM>, but I really can't muster the interest today.

@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~What can I do to be of assistance?~
@3 = ~Ah, go away. Your weakness disgusts me.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I can't talk to anyone. I don't want to. I just want to be able to go home. Ah, why am I telling you this? You can't take on the whole Peninsula district.~
@6 = ~I... I don't know. You can't take on the whole district by yourself... can you? I guess we need a hero... I don't know if that's you. If there is something you can do to help the situation in the Peninsula, I beg you, please do it.~ /*I... I don't know. You can't take on the whole district by yourself... can you? I guess we need a hero... I don't know if that's you.*/
@7 = ~Fare you well. I will be here. There's nowhere else for me to go. Definitely not home.~
@8 = ~I don't need to be reminded of how little I can help myself. We were pushed out by so many... the whole Peninsula district... overrun. Go then, but... please... if you have a chance... please look into the Penisula... It was all we had.~
@9 = ~What do you want? Please tell me you're not one of the thugs that forced us out. I've nothing left to steal. I can't even huddle in my own home anymore.

@10 = ~(sob) What are we to do?~
@11 = ~I can't believe someone took the time to help us. Thank you for all you have done. It may not be much, but the Peninsula is where our homes are.~
