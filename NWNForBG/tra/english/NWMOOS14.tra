@0 = ~It's about time someone showed up to rescue me! Who knows what those savages would have done if you had been much slower!~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Did they hurt you?~
@3 = ~How did the Uthgardt capture you?~
@4 = ~Can you find your way safely out of here?~
@5 = ~NP: Stop talking. It's time for you to die.~ /*Enough yapping. It's time for you to die.*/
@6 = ~Oh, yes, let's waste time with introductions. Don't worry about getting me safely away from here! That would be too much to ask, wouldn't it? My name is Mileene, if you must know. Daddy left me a nice inheritance, so I thought I'd buy a little farm in the countryside. Then those damn savages came and ruined everything!~ /*My name is Mileene, if you must know. Daddy left me a nice inheritance, so I thought I'd buy a little farm in the countryside. Then those damn savages came and ruined everything!*/
@7 = ~So far all they've done is throw me in this cage. Probably saving me for some pagan ritual they hope will cure them of this plague that's infected their whole tribe.~
@8 = ~Anything else you can tell me?~
@9 = ~Are you saying this is my fault? It wasn't! I was just working in my garden out on my farm when those barbarians attacked! They destroyed my home and dragged me kicking and screaming to this prison.~
@10 = ~I suppose I can find my own way out, with these savages all so sick with plague. Some rescue this turned out to be! Hmph! Mother was right. It isn't safe living out on a farm. I'm heading straight for Neverwinter, and you can bet I won't be leaving the city anytime soon again!~ /*Mother was right. It isn't safe living out on a farm. I'm heading straight for Neverwinter, and you can bet I won't be leaving the city anytime soon again!*/
@11 = ~How dare you speak to me like that! I'll scratch your eyes out!~
@12 = ~What else do you expect me to tell you? They captured me. The fact they haven't killed me yet, or worse, probably just means they're planning some horrible, unimaginable torture! Filthy savages!~
