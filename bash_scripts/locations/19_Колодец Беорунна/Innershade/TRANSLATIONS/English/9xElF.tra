@0    = ~You there! Aren't you <CHARNAME>? I saw you talking to my friend, Elhan. I was just about to leave when I saw you.  <CHARNAME> is your name, right? You are a Bhaalspawn, aren't you? I thought you were supposed to be in Athkatla, destroying the vampires there.  I know I may have been out of line, but I overheard your discussion with Elhan. Why are you here?~
@1    = ~I decided to check out a thing or two. I wanted to talk with Eva, purchase some gear, and make sure everything is all right in here. What are *you* doing here?~
@2    = ~I have already destroyed Bodhi. I'm preparing for an even more difficult battle, with Jon Irenicus. I hope it will finally be the end of this whole thing.~
@3    = ~Another elf with ears like pins and a sissy way of talking. Just leave me be, all right? I'm preparing for a battle, and I'm not in the mood to talk with you.~
@4    = ~I've always liked this village, but I rarely have time to spend here. It's sort of a hideout for me. I won't allow battles and elven duties to completely dominate my life.~
@5    = ~So, you still have to battle that vampire. I had hoped you had already eliminated her, however it's a good idea to find allies. It will help ensure your success.~
@6    = ~Joneleth... I see. I am sure Elhan will tell you the details and inform  you of all you need to know.  I am glad that you managed to eliminate Bodhi.  I heard she was a deadly creature, but now she's no longer a threat to you and the elves.~
@7    = ~Irenicus is surely a stronger opponent. He is obsessed with reaching the greatest power, with harassment toward elves, the kin who he feels betrayed him. I feel pity for him.~
@8    = ~You are to fight again. I'll tell you something: you can trust Elhan. He may seem harsh, but he never lets his guard down. He is a good friend and a man of honor. I hope your first meeting didn't make you think badly of him.~
@9    = ~Well, to be honest, I do think badly of him. He doesn't trust me even though we are allies.~
@10   = ~He appears wise. I would behave the same way, to be honest.~
@11   = ~Shut up. I don't intend to listen to your opinions, elf. I am already tired of your babbling.~
@12   = ~I understand, but he couldn't have known if you were a friend or yet another enemy, so he couldn't just blindly trust you. His duty is to protect his men and himself. But still, I am sure he would sacrifice his life if it would save his own. He has always been that kind of man.~
@13   = ~I am glad you understand his motives. I was afraid you felt offended or, worse, you planned to be the same to him. I know him well; he would misunderstand you. Sometimes he's as impulsive as a human. He was like that even as a youngster.~
@14   = ~I would like to know what your next step will be. I'm sorry if that's something you don't wish to discuss. After all, your plans are not my business until they have something to do with my kin. Your chosen method of battle is something that concerns you and your allies.~
@15   = ~To be honest, I would like you to become one of those allies. Can you help me somehow?~
@16   = ~I will fight, just as I always have in the past. I won't fall since I am who I am: a proud <RACE> who does not give up. I won't run.~
@17   = ~It's none of your business. Get lost.~
@18   = ~The question is: do I know how to help you, adventurer?~
@19   = ~Now I see why you have never lost.~
@20   = ~I wish you well, <CHARNAME>. A bit of fortune to you.~
@21   = ~You helped Innershade in the past, and this village is close to my heart. I call it my second home. I owe you something, so I would like to give you a gift. Here, take this.~
@22   = ~It is something that may give you some advantage over Irenicus. This cloak grants a measure of magic resistance.~
@23   = ~I believe you can and will stop this insanity.~
@24   = ~Vampires are difficult and terrifying enemies, and now you are to fight with an extremely powerful one. This cloak will grant you some protection against her deadly claws.~
@25   = ~I believe you can stop this insanity, <CHARNAME>. Take care.~
@26   = ~I won't bother you. However, if you are like that, you will make plenty of enemies, <CHARNAME>. Still, I wish you luck. Take care.~
@27   = ~I am sorry, but I really don't know how I can help. I am also quite busy right now. I wish you luck in your upcoming battles, friend.~
@28   = ~Ah, it's you again. I am just about to leave this place. I can't stay here any longer. I have some duties to fulfill. The most important battle of yours still awaits. I hope we will meet in the future. Good luck.~
