@0 = ~Why have you come, puny one? For what reason have you sought out the cave of one greater than yourself? Why do you disturb the magnificent Akulatraxas?~ [NWDRA251]
@1 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I am searching for the Words of Power.~
@2 = ~I'm with <CHARNAME>. I'm looking for Words of Power.~ 
@3 = ~Please, mighty Akulatraxas, I seek your wisdom in answering these questions I have.~
@4 = ~I have some questions you must answer.~
@5 = ~Give me your treasure, wyrm, or I will slay you!~
@6 = ~I'll be going now.~
@7 = ~I have never heard of these Words of Power, and I have lived in these mountains all my life. I will continue to live here for many more, for that matter, despite the efforts of the hill giants to dislodge me.~
@8 = ~What was that you said about hill giants?~
@9 = ~Great Akulatraxas, why would the hill giants be foolish enough to challenge your might?~
@10 = ~You speak with the respect due a dragon. This is good, <RACE> one. Conversation is far more pleasant than the slaughter I was forced to unleash upon the hill giants who attacked my lair. Now what would you ask of me?~
@11 = ~You are truly a spectacular being. Are there more dragons in the area that I might gaze upon the glory of your species further?~ 
@12 = ~In the grand scope of all your knowledge, do you know anything about the Words of Power?~
@13 = ~Tread carefully, tiny <RACE> <MALEFEMALE>. Only a fool orders about a dragon in her lair. I will forgive your lack of etiquette... this time. Should your insolence continue I will destroy you as I destroyed the hill giants who were foolish enough to attack me here in my own lair! Ask your question but choose your words carefully.~ 
@14 = ~Are you done yapping yet, you overgrown lizard? Your breath stinks like chlorine.~ 
@15 = ~I see you must be taught a lesson about the might of dragons, <RACE> fool! I shall slaughter you as I did the hill giants who attacked my lair!~
@16 = ~If you have business elsewhere you may attend to it. Akulatraxas gives you permission to go, tiny creature.~
@17 = ~Your manner is brusque, <RACE> <MALEFEMALE>. You should show more respect when addressing dragons... Others of my kind may not be as tolerant of your lack of etiquette but I will answer your question.~
@18 = ~The hill giants were trying to steal my eggs! The lairs of many of my kind have come under attack. Too many dragons have all been slain and their eggs taken.~
@19 = ~There are other dragons in the area, though none so magnificent as I. Gorgotha makes her lair to the north in the Spine of the World, though I know little of her. Gold dragons are not fond of my particular breed.~
@20 = ~A great brass named Scylandara also lairs in the Spine of the World, another I try to avoid for she is jealous of me. Most of the others have fled, driven off by the same hill giants who dared to attack me here in my lair!~
@21 = ~But the hill giants are like all the lesser creatures: they are no match for a dragon of my power, even in great numbers. The raiders shall not steal my eggs, I vow this!~
@22 = ~These vile raiders deserve death for daring to come after your offspring!~
@23 = ~I could take care of these hill giants for you... for a price.~
@24 = ~But now I have the head of the hill giant chieftain as a trophy, and without their chief the others will not dare come after my eggs again!~
@25 = ~I cannot leave my lair. I must stay to protect my eggs until they hatch. But I will not rest until the giants are no more and the head of their chief lies at my feet! I would even be willing to part with some of my great hoard to secure the life of my children. Is there more I might do for you while you consider this offer, <RACE> creature?~ 
@26 = ~Where might I find the hill giant chief?~

@28 = ~Bargaining with a dragon in her own lair? You are as stupid as you are brave... Normally I would slay you for your insolence, but these are unusual circumstances.~
@29 = ~The steading of the hill giant chief is on the plateau to the west. Bring me his head and you will get your reward. Now, my tiny instrument of vengeance, is there anything else?~
@30 = ~**sniff - sniff** Akulatraxas recognizes your scent, tiny creature. Why have you returned, puny one, to disturb one far greater than yourself?~ [NWDRA252]
@31 = ~I'm searching for the Words of Power.~
@32 = ~**sniff - sniff** Akulatraxas smells blood and... something else. Something foul. **SNIFF** You have the head of the hill giant chief! Give it to me that I might see the proof of his death with my own eyes!~ [NWDRA250]
@33 = ~I am honored to give you the hill giant's head, mighty Akulatraxas.~
@34 = ~What kind of reward will I get for bringing you this head?~
@35 = ~The hill giants will raid the lairs of my kind no more! By killing their chieftain you have earned my gratitude. The favor of a dragon is not given lightly. We dragons are loathe to part with our treasure hoard, but you have saved my eggs and the lives of my unhatched children from the threat of further giant raids. Take this gold, <RACE> <MALEFEMALE>. It is a fortune by most standards.~ 
@36 = ~I thank you for this generous gift, mighty Akulatraxas.~
@37 = ~Great Akulatraxas, your hoard is as vast as your might. Surely the lives of your offspring are worth more than this?~ 
@38 = ~You better dig a little deeper into that pile of gold, Akulatraxas, or your eggs might not be as safe as you think!~
@39 = ~Tread carefully, <RACE> creature. It is not wise to expose your greed when speaking to a dragon in her lair, lest I think you plan to steal my hoard. Your reward will come in due time, once you give me the chieftain's head!~
@40 = ~I don't like your attitude, dragon. I think I'll keep this head for myself.~
@41 = ~You show the respect that should be shown to dragons. That's good, <RACE>.~

@43 = ~You are bold, <MALEFEMALE>. A smarter creature would accept an offer of dragon's gold before the dragon changes her mind. But I like you, <MALEFEMALE>. You amuse me, as my last few pets failed to do. Why would I want a pet without a collar? Take this necklace, <RACE>. Its magic is not worth my attention, but you may find it amusing.~ 
@44 = ~Your manner is displeasing, creature... but I will forgive your coarse nature because of the task you have done for me. Take this necklace as a final boon, and let this matter be done. In the future, I suggest you show more respect when speaking to a creature so much larger than you.~
@45 = ~You dare threaten my children, foolish <RACE> creature? Such a crime is unforgivable! Now you shall feel the wrath of Akulatraxas!~
