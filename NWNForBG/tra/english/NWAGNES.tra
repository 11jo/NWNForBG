@0 = ~I have nothing to say to you. Talk to my husband.~ 
@1 = ~Hemmel is such a boy. He'd have us stand here for ages thinking his precious heirloom will return. Hmph!~
@2 = ~Forgotten? I TOLD you he was not to be trusted.~
@3 = ~Hemmel, I can swear that you are competent, but that doesn't make it true.~
@4 = ~Who was this man?~
@5 = ~You paid with an amulet?~
@6 = ~I suppose I could look into it for you.~
@7 = ~I've no interest in helping you.~
@8 = ~Oh, well done Hemmel. That shall be your stirring farewell to the Masterson family amulet.~
@9 = ~Please, I hope you will reconsider. This Callik, he has taken advantage of me and I can't do anything about it except point you in his direction.~
@10 = ~Probably stealing that as well. Honestly, Hemmel, you can be such a fool.~
@11 = ~I told you it was a ruse. This Callik made vague promises and you handed over everything.~
@12 = ~Only because you are too much the coward to take it up, Hemmel.~
