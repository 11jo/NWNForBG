@1 = ~Ask anyone, anyone will tell you that the sorcerer Meldanen used portals in his youth to sneak his girls to his house.~/*Nie mogê ci powiedzieæ, co to bêdzie, ale spodoba ci siê.*/
@2 = ~Some druid from the City Core came to our Zoo and demanded that the animals be released. So the zookeeper, Montgomery, ordered his guards to chase him off.~/*Wyda³a siê trochê za bardzo nalegaæ, bym wszed³ do jej domu. Przywódca potworów, Dergiab, nie ¿yje. Mam jego g³owê.*/
@3 = ~Some heroes, they say, were not afraid of Montgomery, himself and freed all the animals from the zoo.~/*Poczyniono postêpy w uwalnianiu zwierz¹t.*/

So some heroes weren't afraid of the sorcerer and punched him in his insolent face.~/*Aribeth obieca³a mi z³ote góry, jeli jej pomogê.

@7 = ~It appears that the Hodge and Rumbottom have done something to Lady Ofala, and now she is seeking revenge.~/*Wygl¹da na to, ¿e gnolle wykorzystuj¹ ten gong jako alarm, dziêki któremu s¹ ostrzegane o pojawieniu siê potencjalnych intruzów.*/
@8 = ~Talk to Formosa in the square by the fountain if you're looking for an adventure here, though of course this may turn out to be your last adventure. Fighting Meldanen himself is not everyone's cup of tea.~/*Bogom niech bêd¹ dziêki. Mo¿e wreszcie wyniknie z tego co dobrego. Bêdê czekaæ na twój powrót. Ja wiedzieæ, ¿e Meldanen mieæ racja! Ty umrzeæ, Formosa!*/
@9 = ~Formosa did not gather in the square for nothing. Someone had taken down that sorcerer Meldanen who had the whole neighborhood in fear.~/*Ty mówiæ, ¿e ty daæ nagrodê za piercieñ. Zrobiê wszystko dla dobra Neverwinter.*/
@10 = ~Well, Formosa's had it. She called for people to kill Meldanen, and now she's dead.~
/*Wojownik Formosy My g³odujemy, a Meldanen gromadzi zapasy.*/
