@0 = ~I hope my husband returns soon. Eckel handled all the business of the family. But I don't know anything about running a farm! This is terrible!~
@1 = ~I have a note here from your husband.~
@2 = ~Where is your husband?~
@3 = ~Luskan forces are pillaging all the farms around here. You have to leave for your own safety.~
@4 = ~Is there anything I can do to help you?~
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~MT: A note from Eckel? Can I take a look? Hmmm... it looks like his signature, that's right. And a list of buyers for our good! Thank you so much for this note! By the way, it says here that Eckel promised you a reward. How about 400 gold?~ /*I can't thank you enough for delivering this note! It says here Eckel promised you a reward. How does 300 gold pieces sound?*/
@7 = ~Thank you, that will be fine.~
@8 = ~Gold be nice. Thank you, gnome lady.~
@9 = ~I think you could spare a little more, seeing as how I saved your farm.~
@10 = ~If you know what's good for you, you'll up the ante on that reward!~
@11 = ~All the able bodied men in the area were conscripted into the army at Fort Ilkard. They're all stuck there defending the fort until this war with Luskan is over.~
@12 = ~Don't worry, I can take care of myself. I used to do my share of adventuring before I met Eckel and we decided to retire to this farm. I still remember a few tricks of the trade.~
@13 = ~Not unless you know someone who wants to buy several hundred bushels of turnips. I think my husband had some buyers lined up, but until he gets back I have no idea where to even begin.~
@14 = ~Off you go, then. Be careful with all those Luskan raiders roaming the countryside...~
@15 = ~Take the gold with my thanks. You've earned it. Without this note, I wouldn't have had a clue where to begin unloading these turnips. We would have been ruined!~
@16 = ~Well, I suppose it wouldn't kill me to kick in a little something extra. You did save Eckel and me from financial ruin. Here, take this scroll. It's a remnant from my adventuring days. I don't think I'll need it anymore.~
@17 = ~Now don't go getting greedy on me. I think you've been offered a pretty fair sum for delivering a simple note. 300 gold is nothing to sneer at now, is it?~
@18 = ~MT: Don't underestimate me! I haven't always been a farmer's wife, you know. I was a pretty good magician in those days when I was looking for adventure! If it wasn't for saving my farm, I'd treat you to a couple of spells that you won't soon forget! But I will respect Eckel's request. Here is the reward you were promised. But you better apologize before I do something we both might regret!~ /*If you hadn't saved my farm, I'd give you a taste of my spells you wouldn't soon forget! But I'll honor Eckel's commitment. Here's the reward you were promised. But you'd better apologize before I do something we both regret!*/
@19 = ~I hope this war with Luskan ends soon, seeing how I miss my husband.~
