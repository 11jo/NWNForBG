@0 = ~Shove off, buddy. These open sores on my face make it tough enough to attract the ladies without your ugly mug hanging around and cramping my style.~
@1 = ~You've got a serious attitude problem.~
@2 = ~I'm here to talk about Rolgan's trial.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~NP: Well, what are you going to do with it? You try anything, and every Union soldier in this camp will be all over you! Take all your complaints about my manners, shove them where the sun don't shine, and get out of here.~ /*So what are you going to do about it? You try anything and every Lords' Alliance soldier in this camp will be all over you!*/
@5 = ~Oh. That prissy priest, Neurik must have sent you. Can't figure out why that sawed off runt wanted me on the jury. Guess he figured I'd be impartial since I hate all races, colors and creeds equally.~
@6 = ~Very enlightened attitude you have there.~
@7 = ~What are your feelings about this case?~
@8 = ~Bye. Don't hurry back.~
@9 = ~What can I say? You get down into the filthy gutters and everyone's crap stinks the same.~
@10 = ~Griff was a rotten bastard, and the Uthgardt did us all a favor by offing him. But if we let him go, we might have drunken savages running through the streets sacrificing us to their goat gods, you know?~
@11 = ~Sounds like you figure he's already guilty.~
@12 = ~The only good thing about that Uthgardt is his wife. I can't wait to see her up testifying at the trial. She's one fine piece of meat, hoo-eee! I wouldn't mind having her pork chops on my plate at dinner tonight.~
@13 = ~You're a disgusting, vile man.~
@14 = ~Is there anyway I can guarantee you find Rolgan not guilty?~
@15 = ~If you're offering a bribe, I'm all ears.~
@16 = ~Here's 100 gold pieces to make sure Rolgan is acquitted.~
@17 = ~Here's 300 gold pieces to make sure Rolgan is acquitted.~
@18 = ~Forget it, I don't trust you. I'll be going now.~
@19 = ~I think you can afford more than that. Make it 300 or no deal.~
@20 = ~NP: You're a pleasure to do business with. Don't worry, I'll vote to let Utgardt go free. But the rest of the jury is still your problem. Now get out and leave me alone until the trial before people get suspicious! I don't want word of this to get to Newrick.~ /*Pleasure doing business with you. Don't worry, I'll vote to let that Uthgardt go free. But the rest of the jurors are still your problem, not mine.*/
@21 = ~Smile, baby, this is your lucky day. I may be old and covered in open sores, but don't let that turn you off! I got a special today: a free ride on the wild Averik for every <PRO_RACE> female who comes along.~
@22 = ~You again? Listen, I already told you I'd vote to let that Uthgardt savage go free. I took the bribe and our business is done.~
@23 = ~Now shove off and leave me alone until after the trial or people might get suspicious! I don't want news of this to get back to Neurik.~
@24 = ~Look at this... it's the smooth talking lawyer! Tough break about that Uthgardt murderer getting his head chopped off. Maybe I should go see if his pretty little wife needs someone to comfort her in her grief.~
@25 = ~Rolgan was no murderer. He was only defending himself!~
@26 = ~I'd never defend a horrible man like you!~
@27 = ~Well, look at this. If it isn't the smooth talking lawyer! If I ever murder someone, I'm going to get you to represent me!~
@28 = ~That's the same song you were singing at the trial - I'm getting a little bored with it. Anyway, I didn't come here to this bar to talk about the trial. I'm just looking for some female companionship! So...~
@29 = ~You're pretty quick to judge me, considering you represented a killer and all. But I didn't come to this bar to talk about the tiral. I'm just looking for some female companionship. So...~
@30 = ~Smile, baby, this is your lucky day. I may be old and covered in open sores, but don't let that turn you off! I got a special today: a free ride on the wild Averik for every <PRO_RACE> female who comes along.~
@31 = ~I'd rather mate with a dead ogre.~
@32 = ~Forget it, you're not my type.~
@33 = ~Sure. I'm always ready for some good lovin'!~
@34 = ~Me should go, maybe.~
@35 = ~Mate with a dead ogre, huh? You didn't use to do a stage show at this club back in Luskan a few years ago, did you? No? Nevermind.~
@36 = ~Hey, no hard feelings doll. We're both adults. Sometimes these things just don't work out.~
@37 = ~Whoa, coming on kind of strong, ain't you? You're talking like a fella... wait a minute! I been burned by this before. Sorry, 'sister' but I don't need any surprises under the skirt, you follow?~
