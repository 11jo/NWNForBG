@0 = ~Greetings. You must be a new recruit. No one else is foolish enough to approach the gate to the Beggar's Nest. Ugh... I'm sorry... give me a moment. The smell of the burning corpses is getting to me... As if the plague isn't bad enough on it's own. And now the Beggar's Nest is even worse! Have you heard?~ 
@1 = ~It's a nightmare in there. Zombies are everywhere. We're keeping the City Core secure, but damned if we can do much for the Nest.~
@2 = ~Is this area quarantined? Do you let anyone in or out?~
@3 = ~Beggar's Nest closed? You stop sick by stopping people?~
@4 = ~Have you heard anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@5 = ~Farewell. Wish me luck.~
@6 = ~As a guard, you'll be allowed to pass. Other than that, we've tried to keep it sealed. The plague is worst in the Nest, and now there's undead... The zombie threat is keeping people in their homes, so there haven't been many confrontations between the guards and people trying to break quarantine.~ 
@7 = ~Ah yes, I had heard you were making progress finding them. Aside from what you have done, I can't say I have heard anything good. Maybe you'll be able to help some more, but I'm not as hopeful as I once was. I figure the creatures are all dead. Of course, being dead hasn't stopped all the zombies in the Nest. You can't count on anything to make sense right now.~ 
@8 = ~Aribeth has you looking for those, hmm? Sorry, I can't help you. I haven't heard anything about them. They are probably all dead. Of course, being dead hasn't stopped all the zombies in the Nest. You can't count on anything to make sense right now.~ 
@9 = ~I will, but I don't hold much hope for the district. It's the worst hit by the plague and now the undead are killing everything...~
@10 = ~The Helmites were allowed in to establish a shrine. I hear they continue to grant blessings. I doubt they counted on the undead infestation though.~
@11 = ~Is there anywhere I should go, specifically?~
@12 = ~Is this the last outpost of city guards?~
@13 = ~There's a tavern. The Shining Serpent. It's in the south central of the Beggar's Nest. Harben Ashensmith is there, organizing people.~
@14 = ~Who is Harben Ashensmith?~
@15 = ~There are some on the other side of the gate. They were supposed to keep the plague victims from rioting, but now they must contain the undead. It's an impossible job. We don't have the manpower to maintain patrols. Hopefully you will be able to help us with that.~ 
@16 = ~He's a friend of the guards. I'm not sure of his official rank. He doesn't like to use it much. He prefers to stand with the rank and file. He'll be able to give you more information than I can. If he's still there and alive, that is.~ 
@17 = ~You should speak to Harben Ashensmth. He's been organizing people to keep them safe. He's in the Shining Serpent tavern, south central area of the district.~
@18 = ~<CHARNAME>, I've heard of what you are doing in Neverwinter. I'm sure you'll sort out the Beggar's Nest in no time. Ugh... I'm sorry... give me a moment. The smell of the burning corpses is getting to me... As if the plague isn't bad enough on it's own. And now the Beggar's Nest is even worse! Have you heard?~ 
@19 = ~I am told the Beggar's Nest is significantly safer, thanks to your efforts, <CHARNAME>. Such work will earn you great respect here in Neverwinter.~ 
@20 = ~I am told the Beggar's Nest is significantly safer, thanks to your efforts, <CHARNAME>. Such work will earn you great respect here in Neverwinter.~
