@0 = ~Ah. I see the fly in the ointment has finally arrived.~
@1 = ~And who are you?~
@2 = ~You were expecting me?~
@3 = ~So you're... Maugrim?~
@4 = ~Someone who has been following your progress through the tower with a great deal of interest, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You show remarkable determination. I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.~ /*I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.*/
@5 = ~You are Arklem Greeth, then... the former Archmage Arcane.~
@6 = ~You know of me? I have no idea who you are.~
@7 = ~Another one of Maugrim's prisoners, then?~
@8 = ~Someone who has been following your progress through the tower with a great deal of interest, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You show remarkable determination. I was the master of this tower long before the usurper took his place. I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.~ /*I was the master of this tower long before the usurper took his place. I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.*/
@9 = ~Are you surprised? This tower is a living thing, in its own manner. To anyone as accustomed to its rhythms as myself, you are the veritable bull in a china shop. I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.~ /*I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you.

@11 = ~Don't be so foolish, <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You expect the new 'master' of the tower to calmly await your arrival in a cage of magic? I think not. I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you. Sadly she has not been able to reach my old sanctum as you have, or I would already be free.~ /*I have been in contact with my dear Nyphithys, and she has told me much about you.

I sensed your presence here immediately, even from this little prison.*/
@13 = ~So my own reputation precedes me. Yes... you have the right of it, little mortal. I fled the tower when Maugrim showed his true intention, but not quickly enough. Maugrim has power you cannot even imagine. His mistress favors him... and even the power granted me by this... form... could not resist capture in the end.~ /*So my own reputation precedes me. Yes... you have the right of it, little mortal. I fled the tower when Maugrim showed his true intention, but not quickly enough.*/
@14 = ~You are a lich! An undead thing!~
@15 = ~Maybe you're just weaker than you thought.~
@16 = ~Interesting. Transformed yourself into a lich, have you?~
@17 = ~Bah. Blundering about the tower on some fool's errand, no doubt, without a thought as to where you are. No matter. My name is Arklem Greeth, little mortal. It was I who was once the Archmage Arcane of the brotherhood. I fled from this tower when Maugrim showed his true intentions, but not quickly enough.~ /*Bah. Blundering about the tower on some fool's errand, no doubt, without a thought as to where you are. No matter. My name is Arklem Greeth, little mortal.*/
@18 = ~Oh, indeed. I am Maugrim's prize, if the truth be known. I am Arklem Greeth... the former Archmage Arcane of the brotherhood, little mortal. Maugrim has power you cannot even imagine. His mistress favors him... and even the power granted me by this... form... could not resist capture in the end.~ /*Maugrim has power you cannot even imagine. His mistress favors him... and even the power granted me by this... form... could not resist capture in the end.*/
@19 = ~Indeed. Do not get yourself in a huff about it, mortal. At the moment, our interests rather coincide, don't you think? Free me from this magical prison, mortal. You assist me... and I shall assist you.~ /*Indeed. Do not get yourself in a huff about it, mortal. At the moment, our interests rather coincide, don't you think?*/
@20 = ~I have some questions, first.~
@21 = ~Why would I free you?~
@22 = ~Can you reward me for letting you go?~
@23 = ~I'd rather kill you where you stand, creature!~
@24 = ~Maugrim caught me by surprise, mortal. His power far surpassed anything I had suspected in him. Regardless, he is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide rather nicely, don't you think? Free me from this magical prison, mortal. You assist me... and I shall assist you.~ /*Maugrim caught me by surprise, mortal. His power far surpassed anything I had suspected in him. Regardless, he is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide rather nicely, don't you think?*/
@25 = ~I have, at Nyphithys's advice, in fact. It has proven remarkably beneficial... both for myself and the brotherhood. Maugrim was a... a surprise. He is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide, yes? Free me from this magical prison, mortal. You assist me... and I shall assist you.~ /*I have, at Nyphithys's advice, in fact. It has proven remarkably beneficial... both for myself and the brotherhood. Maugrim was a... a surprise. He is my enemy... and that means our interests coincide, yes?*/
@26 = ~Naturally. Go ahead, mortal. I'd be interested to hear what you have to ask.~
@27 = ~What do you know about Maugrim and his cult?~
@28 = ~Do you know if Aribeth is with Maugrim?~
@29 = ~Why is Maugrim keeping you captive? Why not kill you?~
@30 = ~Would you be willing to help me fight Maugrim?~
@31 = ~That's enough questions.~
@32 = ~Why, indeed? How about this, my unimaginative <PRO_RACE> friend? You see the door that leads into my sanctum? Have you tried to open it? It is locked tightly... with spells that I'm positive you have no ability to break. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?~ /*It is locked tightly... with spells that I'm positive you have no ability to break. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?*/
@33 = ~A reward? Certainly, my dear <PRO_RACE> friend. I can reward you. You see that door that leads into my sanctum? Have you tried to open it? It is locked tightly... with spells that I'm quite sure are beyond even your ability to dispel. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?~ /*It is locked tightly... with spells that I'm quite sure are beyond even your ability to dispel. I happen to know that Maugrim lies beyond it. He is the one you came here for, no?*/
@34 = ~Oh, truly? You are an amusing one, mortal. You can certainly try to kill me. The spells Maugrim has enveloped me in to keep me here would prevent your success... but you are free to try. Wouldn't you rather discuss your options... or lack thereof... instead, hm?~ /*Oh, truly? You are an amusing one, mortal. You can certainly try to kill me. The spells Maugrim has enveloped me in to keep me here would prevent your success... but you are free to try.*/
@35 = ~Forget it! I'll take my chances!~
@36 = ~Ahhh, now that is an interesting question. I, myself, have wondered much about the nature of Maugrim's mistress. How is it that she gives him such power? The plague was loosed to strengthen her, you see. Each death in Neverwinter fed her with new life-force. And I know she seeks even more power, yet. Maugrim is desperate to find what he calls the 'Words of Power'. They are ancient artifacts I believe... four in total, though I had never heard of them before Maugrim, himself, made mention. He holds only one, but his mistress wishes them all.~ /*Maugrim is desperate to find what he calls the 'Words of Power'. They are ancient artifacts I believe... four in total, though I had never heard of them before Maugrim, himself, made mention. He holds only one, but his mistress wishes them all.*/
@37 = ~The elven blackguard? Indeed. She came with him and lies beyond that door. If you hurry, you just might catch her. Do you have more questions?~ /*The elven blackguard? Indeed. She came with him and lies beyond that door. If you hurry, you just might catch her.*/
@38 = ~There are many secrets of this tower that are yet mine alone. If Maugrim knew what I knew, he would already be aware of you... and you would not have made it so far. Consider yourself lucky. If I didn't think that you might actually cause a problem for the fool, I might have been amused to warn Maugrim of your presence. Do you have more questions?~ /*There are many secrets of this tower that are yet mine alone. If Maugrim knew what I knew, he would already be aware of you... and you would not have made it so far.*/
@39 = ~Certainly not. You are on your own with your foolish quest. I intend to leave this tower and regroup elsewhere with my dear Nyphithys. With luck, you will at least weaken Maugrim... or at least drive him from this tower. I intend to take advantage of that, in time. Do you have more questions?~ /*With luck, you will at least weaken Maugrim... or at least drive him from this tower. I intend to take advantage of that, in time.*/
@40 = ~Then what shall it be? Will you free me now?~
@41 = ~How do I get you out of there, then?~
@42 = ~I created the spells that hold the door. I can open it for you... but only if I am freed. It's either that or... you are certainly free to return whence you came. In failure. So what do you say now, mortal? Do you really have a choice?~ /*I created the spells that hold the door. I can open it for you... but only if I am freed. It's either that or... you are certainly free to return whence you came. In failure.*/
@43 = ~(sigh) You mortals with your limited minds. Very well... do as you wish, if it satisfies your perverse sense of independence.~
@44 = ~What these 'Words of Power' would do for Maugrim and his mistress one can only guess... I'm sure you can. It would amuse me to see you halt their efforts, if that is your goal. Do you have more questions?~ /*What these 'Words of Power' would do for Maugrim and his mistress one can only guess... I'm sure you can. It would amuse me to see you halt their efforts, if that is your goal.*/
@45 = ~You see the four braziers that surround me? They sustain the magic that Maugrim keeps me held within... in much the same manner that Nyphithys was held. They are protected by their own magic... too much for me to overcome on my own. If you were to damage them, however... and I was to add my power to yours... they could be destroyed, and I freed.~ /*They are protected by their own magic... too much for me to overcome on my own. If you were to damage them, however... and I was to add my power to yours... they could be destroyed, and I freed.*/
@46 = ~NP: Do you see the three braziers that surround me? They feed the magical energy that Mawgrim keeps me here... They are protected by their own magic... it's too much for me to overcome on my own. However, if you manage to damage them... And I would combine my power with yours... When they are destroyed, I will be free.~ /*They are protected by their own magic... too much for me to overcome on my own. If you were to damage them, however... and I was to add my power to yours... they could be destroyed, and I freed.*/
@47 = ~Attack them however you wish and I will turn my own efforts toward aiding you. Then I shall open the door to my sanctum for you... and I shall leave.~
@48 = ~How do I know I can trust you?~
@49 = ~What's to keep me from killing you afterwards?~
@50 = ~Foolish <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You can't. You can trust, however, that I would rather be away from here than deal with you myself. Have you another choice? Go, then. I tire of this cage. I would see Maugrim dance before whatever <PRO_RACE> fury you can muster.~ /*Foolish <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You can't. You can trust, however, that I would rather be away from here than deal with you myself. Have you another choice?*/
@51 = ~Hmph. You can certainly try if you wish, fool... I will not remain here long enough for you to break through my own protections, however, I can assure you. Go, then. I tire of this cage. I would see Maugrim dance before whatever <PRO_RACE> fury you can muster.~ /*Hmph. You can certainly try if you wish, fool... I will not remain here long enough for you to break through my own protections, however, I can assure you.*/
@52 = ~So? Will you free me or no, little mortal?~
@53 = ~Wait a minute... who are you?~
@54 = ~I am waiting, fool. Destroy the braziers and I will add my power to yours. I desire to be free!~
@55 = ~It is done! I am free at last! Would that I could visit vengeance upon Maugrim for this indignity myself!~
@56 = ~But you... you intend to be the fly in Maugrim's ointment, do you not? That will do. I will tell you what I know of his desires, little mortal. Have you not wondered at the nature of Maugrim's mistress? How it is that she gives him such power? The plague was loosed to strengthen her, you see. Each death in Neverwinter fed her with new life-force. And I know she seeks even more power, yet.~ /*The plague was loosed to strengthen her, you see. Each death in Neverwinter fed her with new life-force. And I know she seeks even more power, yet.*/
@57 = ~I give you thanks for my freedom, mortal. I shall open the door to my sanctum... you may deal with Maugrim at your leisure. Do not be here, however, when I return.~
@58 = ~Maugrim is desperate to find what he calls the 'Words of Power'. They are ancient artifacts I believe... four in total, though I had never heard of them before Maugrim, himself, made mention. He holds only one, but his mistress wishes them all. What these 'Words of Power' would do for Maugrim and his mistress one can only guess... I'm sure you can.
