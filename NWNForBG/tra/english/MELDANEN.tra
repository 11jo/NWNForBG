@0 = ~Formosa sent you to kill me, didn't she?! Didn't she?! Why are you here?!~ [MELDAN54]
@1 = ~I'm here to free the dryad you stole, sorcerer.~
@2 = ~So you have the dryad, then? Unbelievable!~
@3 = ~Well... there is the matter of the dryad in the cage.~
@4 = ~NP: I didn't steal it! I found her wandering the streets and took her home. Actually, I was going to make a cure for pestilence from it and then sell it at crazy prices. However, her... charms... weakened my resolve and put my research on hold. Ba! Of course, take her, otherwise I will never be able to get rid of her influence.~ /*Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.*/
@5 = ~NP: Are you... here because of the dryad? Yes... yes, she wandered the streets and I had to take her home. At first it occurred to me to use it to find a cure for the plague and sell it for a very high price. However, her... charms... weakened my resolve and put my research on hold. Ba! Of course, take her, otherwise I will never be able to get rid of her influence.~ /*You are... here for the dryad? Yes... yes, I found her wandering the streets and took her in. At first it was my plan to use her to find a cure for the plague and sell it to the highest bidder.*/
@6 = ~NP: You... came for the dryad, not for me? So she really is one of the Waterdeep creatures, as I suspected. At first it occurred to me to use it to find a cure for the plague and sell it to the highest bidder to earn extra money. However, her... charms... weakened my resolve and put my research on hold. Ba! Of course, take her, otherwise I will never be able to get rid of her influence.~ /*Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.*/
@7 = ~So... are you saying, then, that Formosa did not send you? You... you will spare me if I give you the key to the Dryad's cage?~
@8 = ~Who's this Formosa? I have no idea who you're talking about.~
@9 = ~I have no intention of sparing you, but all the pleading is quite amusing.~
@10 = ~No, Formosa did send me, actually. Now you die.~
@11 = ~That's right. Give me the dryad and you can go.~
@12 = ~NP: I need the key to your warehouse and the dryad. Then I will let you live.~ /*I want the key to your warehouse, as well. You can live.*/
@13 = ~Make me an offer and I'll consider it.~
@14 = ~NP: Didn't that stupid elf woman send you? Then what do you need?~ /*That fool elven woman didn't send you? Then why are you here?*/
@15 = ~To kill you, I suppose. And it's high time I got back to it.~
@16 = ~I'm simply here looking for some coin.~
@17 = ~I meant no harm. You attacked me, remember?~
@18 = ~No! I will kill you, fool, I will!!~
@19 = ~NP: You are... amazingly merciful. I think I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take it. I hope I never see you again. Oh, and maybe you should take this key to Formosa as well. In addition to the dryad's cage, he also opens my warehouse. Now go. Leave.~ /*You are... unexpectedly merciful. I suppose I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take her. I will hope not to see you again.*/
@20 = ~NP: You are... amazingly merciful. I think I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take it. I hope I never see you again. In addition to the dryad's cage, he also opens my warehouse. Now go. Leave.~ /*You are... unexpectedly merciful. I suppose I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take her. I will hope not to see you again.*/
@21 = ~Spare my life and I'll give you 500 gp. It is all I have... and surely more than Formosa could possibly have paid you.~
@22 = ~NP: Why don't I take your money myself?~ /*Now why didn't I say that?*/
@23 = ~I would need your silver tooth as well as the key to your warehouse.~
@24 = ~Sounds like this Formosa wants to kill you. Pay me more and I'll deal with her for you.~
@25 = ~Give me more and I'll deal with Formosa for you.~
@26 = ~Fine. The gold and the dryad, and you go free.~
@27 = ~No, I'd rather kill you.~
@28 = ~Well if it's coin you seek, I have plenty. I am more than willing to offer it to you in exchange for a task, perhaps?~
@29 = ~What do you have in mind, exactly?~
@30 = ~And what's to stop me from just taking all you own anyway?~
@31 = ~Too much bother. I'd rather kill you.~
@32 = ~My estate is well-guarded. You expect me to believe you came here simply by accident? Your type seeks coin and treasure, yes?~
@33 = ~N-nothing. It... is all the coin I have here, however. Please, I beg you for mercy!~
@34 = ~So the wench did send you. Bah! Fine... I shall rip out my silver tooth and give you both it and the key. I am not above purchasing my life.~
@35 = ~Fine. I'll take them and your gold... and you flee before I change my mind.~
@36 = ~NP: I don't have to do this at all. If you pay me more, I'll take care of Formos for you.~ /*You know, I don't have to do this. Pay me more and I'll take care of Formosa for you.*/
@37 = ~Forget it. The dryad is all that's important... just leave.~
@38 = ~Just give me the tooth and key. Keep your gold and run.~
@39 = ~Nevermind the tooth. Just the key and your gold will do.~
@40 = ~I can give you the 500 gold pieces now. If you deal with Formosa and return, I can get another 500 gold pieces by then and pay you that as well.~
@41 = ~Give up the dryad, as well. Then I'll do it.~
@42 = ~No, just give me the dryad and your gold and I'll leave you be.~
@43 = ~No, I'm not killing anyone... I came for the dryad. Just go.~
@44 = ~NP: T-thank you for your generosity... whatever it may be. Someday I will repay this creature for my humiliation. Here are 1800 gold coins, that's all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope I never see you again.~ /*Here is 500 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@45 = ~I have 500 gold pieces now... take that and kill Formosa before she convinces some other fool to try to kill me. When you return, I'll pay you another 500 gp.~
@46 = ~Nothing. I have little doubt you have looted my home already. But... if you kill Formosa for me I can give you even more gold later... gold you won't get any other way.~
@47 = ~NP: I think I should agree to your terms. Great... AGGGGH!... w-that's... that's my tooth... and the key to the warehouse. And here is my ransom: 1800 gold. The key to the warehouse also unlocks the dryad's cage. Take it... take it and leave. I hope I never see you again.~ /*And here is my ransom: 500 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@48 = ~NP: Guess I'll have to take this as an act of generosity. Great... AHGHH!... w-here... here's my tooth... and the key to the warehouse. As for the dryad... the key to the warehouse also unlocks her cage. Take it... and take it and go. I hope I never see you again.~ /*As for the dryad... the warehouse key also opens her cage. Take it... and take her and get out. I hope I shall not see you again.*/
@49 = ~NP: I guess I should thank you for your generosity... Here... take the key this girl needs. Take it. And here is my ransom: 1800 gold. The key to the warehouse also unlocks the dryad's cage. Take it... take it and leave. I hope I never see you again.~ /*And here is my ransom: 500 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@50 = ~NP: As you wish. You will find this elven whore wailing in the square in the southeastern part of the district. How I would love to see her dying expression! Here are 1500 gold coins and the key to the dryad's cage. You'll get the rest of the money when I'm sure Formosa is dead. Then we'll talk.~ /*As you wish. You'll find the elven wench preaching in the square in the southeast part of the district. I truly wish I could see the look on her face!*/

@52 = ~NP: As you wish. After all, I can buy my own life and run away from home. Here's 1800 gold coins, that's all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope I never see you again.~ /*Here is 500 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@53 = ~I am leaving. Now begone.~ [MELDAN55]
@54 = ~NP: Formosa is still alive. I'm waiting for you to kill this creature.~ /*I can't wait until this whole plague business is done with.*/
@55 = ~NP: It dawned on me that Formosa is indeed dead, as we agreed. Great job. Here is the promised 1500 gold, although it was hard to get. I hope this is enough.~ [MELDAN52] /*It has come to my attention that Formosa is, indeed, dead as we agreed. Well done.*/
@56 = ~Don't you think saving your life is worth a little more gold than that?~
@57 = ~NP: Think about it... your life is hanging by a thread, dumbass.~ /*You better dig a little deeper... your life is on the line, fool.*/
@58 = ~NP: Enough, give me money.~ /*Okay. Me pay money.*/
@59 = ~It doesn't matter... I won't let you live, regardless.~
@60 = ~Err... yes, of course... but this is simply all the wealth I can obtain. I could get no more even if I tried.~
@61 = ~NP: That's enough, give me money.~ /*That is sufficient. Thank you.*/
@62 = ~I... I... I have no more coin. Please... just take the gold and leave, I beg you!~
@63 = ~Here it is. Now leave... I hope I will not see you again.~

@65 = ~What? But... I have nothing else of value! Why would you do this?!~
@66 = ~I was only kidding. Your gold will do.~
@67 = ~I bet you have more than you're saying. I'll just search your corpse!~
@68 = ~Because I enjoy it, of course.~
