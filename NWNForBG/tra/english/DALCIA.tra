@0 = ~On behalf of the Black Lion Uthgardt tribe, I welcome you to this camp.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I'm representing Rolgan at his murder trial.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~NP: I am Dalsia, friend of the people of Uthgardt. I would rather stay here, in the camp of the Black Lion Tribe, than breathe the stench of the civilized world, loitering outside the barracks of the Lords' Union. Of course, you, child of nature, understand my feelings. If you walk around the camp, you will realize that the Black Lion Tribe shares our love for the beauty of the pristine wilderness. The people of Utgardt are truly noble people.~ /*Surely as a fellow child of nature you can understand how I feel. If you explore the camp you will discover the Black Lion tribe shares our love of the unspoiled beauty of the natural world. The Uthgardt truly are a noble people.*/
@5 = ~NP: I am Dalsia, friend of the people of Uthgardt. I would rather stay here, in the camp of the Black Lion Tribe, than breathe the stench of the civilized world, loitering outside the barracks of the Lords' Union. I don't expect you to understand us. Only those who consider themselves children of nature, druids and trackers like myself, can fully enjoy being in this simple camp.~ /*I am Dalcia, a friend of the Uthgardt people. I would rather stay here in the camp of the Black Lion Tribe than subject myself to the stench of civilization hanging over the Lords' Alliance barracks.*/
@6 = ~NP: Ah, yes. Newrick mentioned he's looking for someone to defend Rolgan at trial. I hope you're comfortable with the situation you're in now. The people of Uthgardt are a noble people, but their culture and their beliefs seem strange to the Union of Lords. Very often the Uthgardts are victims of prejudice, hated just because they are them.~ /*The Uthgardt are a noble people, but their culture and beliefs seem strange to the Lords' Alliance. Often, the Uthgardt are victims of prejudice and hatred simply because of who they are.*/
@7 = ~Sounds like you think Rolgan is innocent.~
@8 = ~You are welcome to explore the tribal camp. I only ask that you respect the ways of the Black Lion Tribe and treat the Uthgardt with the honor they deserve.~
@9 = ~I will wait until the trial before I make that decison, of course. I only wanted you to be aware that the fact Rolgan is an Uthgardt might have something to do with him being on trial.~
@10 = ~Is there any way I can guarantee you reach a verdict of not guilty?~
@11 = ~I hope you are not insinuating anything improper. Justice must run its proper course. Present a strong case on Rolgan's behalf. That is all you can do. Perhaps we should end this discussion now, before things are said that are best left unspoken.~
@12 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. On behalf of the Black Lion Uthgardt tribe let me extend my thanks for your efforts on behalf of Rolgan at his trial.~
@13 = ~I was just happy to help.~
@14 = ~You did much when others of the Lords' Alliance did nothing. For that you are forever a friend of the people of the Black Lion.~
@15 = ~The Black Lion tribe call you Oathbreaker for failing to defend Rolgan. You should leave this place - you are no longer welcome here.~
