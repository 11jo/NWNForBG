@0 = ~What do you want? I ain't looking for a fight, friend, so please don't hurt me.~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~If that will get you to leave without hurting me, I will answer what I can.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about the Beggar's Nest.~
@5 = ~What do you know about all the zombies?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~I need to talk to you about gold.~
@8 = ~Goodbye. Please, leave me in peace.~
@9 = ~That's it? Couldn't you just... wander around, or something? What do you need to know?~
@10 = ~Has the effect of the plague been bad here?~
@11 = ~Are there any safe places?~
@12 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@13 = ~I know they are gone, and that's enough for me. I don't care who or what got rid of them, but I'm grateful.~
@14 = ~I wanted to ask about the Beggar's Nest.~
@15 = ~I don't want to know anything about any walking dead. That is just... it's not right!~
@16 = ~When did they first start showing up?~
@17 = ~What do you want me to say? I haven't seen much of anything. I've been boarded up in here, trying not to get the plague.~
@18 = ~I have an answer for you before you say another word. I have none. I have already been robbed blind, thank you very much. Have you any other questions, or will you be leaving now?~
@19 = ~Can you tell me anything about the zombies?~
@20 = ~I mean, at least the zombies seem to have gone away, but the plague is still there... I can't see it, but I know it's there.~
@21 = ~Now there's dead people walking around. Dead people! What is someone like me supposed to do about that?~
@22 = ~Anything strange besides the plague and undead then?~
@23 = ~How can you ask that? What kind of life do you lead where plague and walking dead are no longer strange? Some sort of plague-y undead-walky town, that's where you live. <HESHE> asks me what's strange besides plague and undead... yeesh.~
@24 = ~Something strange *other* than plague and undead? I never thought I would be considering something like that, but... maybe... The Beggar's Nest has its share of strange people. Just plain mean ones too. There's a gang that's always been a problem. And a cult.~ 
@25 = ~What do you know about the gang?~
@26 = ~What do you know about the cult?~
@27 = ~They call themselves the Sword Coast Boys. Copperthieves, mostly. No real troublemakers... except maybe for that Drawl guy. He is their leader, but for all I know, they could all be dead to plague. They used to hang out in the north end of the Nest, I think.~ 
@28 = ~Nothing, and I don't want to know anything. Bunch of Cyric worshippers, I think. Not a sane one in the bunch. Don't know what's happened to them in this plague. I wouldn't feel bad about losing them, though.~ 
@29 = ~What do you want? You've the look of a bandit to you, so... uh... please don't hurt me.~
