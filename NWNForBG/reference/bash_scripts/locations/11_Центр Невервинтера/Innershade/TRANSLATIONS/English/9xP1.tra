@0 = ~Ah, it's you. I was told that someone new had entered Innershade. I am Dawnmaster Patric, priest of Lathander, though I know some arcane magic as well. Were the villagers harsh to you? We have some problems, so please try to understand them. Still, I'm pleased to meet you. Do you need something?~
@1 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. What kind of problems are you having? I'm an adventurer, so maybe I could help you, Patric.~
@2 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I'm just wandering through Faerun. I heard about your village, and I decided to visit it. May I ask you few questions, Dawnmaster?~
@3 = ~No, nothing. To be honest, I have to go.~
@4 = ~Ah, it's you again. Can I help you?~
@5 = ~You mentioned some kind of problem. What did you mean?~
@6 = ~Yes, I'd like to ask you some questions about Innershade.~
@7 = ~No. I have to go. Bye!~
@8 = ~I was in the mines, but I found nothing unusual. No corpses, just a golden coin, probably from one of the missing. What I should do?~
@9 = ~I have to tell you something. There's a child whose father was killed by the monster from the mines, so he's alone. Can you help him?~
@10 = ~Ah, it's our hero! Come in, come in! Tell me, how can I help you?~
@11 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions about Innershade.~
@12 = ~I have to go. Bye!~
@13 = ~Patric, there's a child whose father was killed by the monster from the mines, and he's alone. Can you help him?~
@14 = ~I'm not sure if I should bother you with my problems... No... Not my problems, *our* problems, and all of the villagers'. What's more, this may be dangerous. Your own life may be at risk.~
@15 = ~Did you ever hear about the hero of Baldur's Gate? I know how to solve problems like this. Tell me more.~
@16 = ~You should have more faith. I'm offering my help, and if you want to solve your problem, you'll need it.~
@17 = ~Maybe you're right. May I ask some questions about this village?~
@18 = ~Well... I will go then...~
@19 = ~You are right. I need someone. But you should know that this is no normal task. You are probably used to some problems. But...this is something else.~
@20 = ~It began perhaps two weeks ago. Some of the villagers...disappeared. But usually when someone disappears, they vanish to gods-know-where. They entered the mines north of our village. The miners were first: one of them simply walked into a tunnel. Some other miners heard a panicked laugh, then crying. When they started to search for him, they found...nothing. Everything was normal... there were only crystals, rocks... Nothing else...~
@21 = ~The miner's wife disappeared next. She decided to look for her husband, and never came back. The children say they heard another child singing in the cave, but they were all outside the mines. I don't know if this is true, but it's better not to hide it.~
@22 = ~There were two more of these accidents. I have no idea what the attacker might want. I was there six times, but nothing appeared. The crystals were still there, so this... thing... is not there for them. There's nothing more that a creature could be interested in... only rocks and water.~
@23 = ~I understand. I'll take a look into this.~
@24 = ~All right. I have to go, but perhaps I'll look into this. I make no promises.~
@25 = ~If you're going to visit the mine, please be careful.~
@26 = ~Ask. I will try to answer all your questions.~
@27 = ~How old is this village?~
@28 = ~Do you know if someone in the village needs help?~
@29 = ~Do you know about Strongheart and Eva's problem?~
@30 = ~I need some decent equipment. Where can I find a merchant?~
@31 = ~Can you heal me?~
@32 = ~I have to go.~
@33 = ~It has been here only a few years. I'm surprised that you learned of it. We are quite a small community, a garden hidden in the deep forest.~
@34 = ~I have another question.~
@35 = ~I have to go now.~
@36 = ~You may talk with Strongheart. Maybe he will need some help.~
@37 = ~Maybe it's silly, but...there's an old lady in our village. She has no family, and the other villagers are too busy to talk with her. She's very lonely. If you have some time to spare, please talk with her a bit.~
@38 = ~Yes, I know, but I'm not the best person to help them. It would be better if one of them cleared this up.~
@39 = ~If you're looking for weaponry or armor, visit Eva. She is our blacksmith. You can find her north of this tower.~
@40 = ~Sorry, but I'm busy. My friend is the healer of Innershade. If he is in the village, you will find him north of the wood chopper, near the Redplant.~
@41 = ~May the gods watch over you.~
@42 = ~I see... Usually there's some time between disappearances. If you really want to help, go there again and rest there. I think you'll meet the attacker then, but please, be careful. It may be dangerous, but this should call the creature from its hideout.~
@43 = ~I've heard of this. One of the women from the village came to me with him. Probably you didn't see him because she took him to the pond to bathe him. He should be back already.~
@44 = ~I'll take care of him. I will teach him about the gods, and if he wishes to become a Dawnbringer, I will help. Thank you for taking care of him. Now he'll be fine. If you would like to talk with him, he'll be on the first floor of my tower.~
@45 = ~Ah, I heard what you've done! Thank you for giving Barbara the youth she lost so long ago! You are a really noble person, <CHARNAME>~
