@0 = ~Have you heard the stories about what the Luskan soldiers do to the civilians they capture? Maybe it would have been better if I had died from the plague!~
@1 = ~I used to admire Aribeth, but her betrayal has doomed us all! I hope she burns in the Nine Hells for what she's done!~
@2 = ~You're the hero who saved us from the Wailing Death! Have you come here to save the city one last time, or are you trapped here like the rest of us?~
@3 = ~The soldiers won't be able to hold the City Core much longer. Soon the enemy will break through and slaughter us all!~
