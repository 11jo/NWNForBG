@0 = ~Greetings, Judge, and welcome to the Castle Jhareg... I hope you have learned your lessons well.~ [NWGUA050]
@1 = ~Why do you call me Judge?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~What is this place? Who is Lord over this castle?~
@4 = ~Why do you haunt this place, Spirit?~
@5 = ~I call you by what you are and what you may yet be, my child. Lathander, god of the dawn, has waited long for you.~
@6 = ~I am a divine spirit sent by the god Lathander to watch over this place until the day of Judgment. And now that day has come...~
@7 = ~This castle was once home to the brothers Jhareg. Now it stands trapped in time by Lathander, god of the dawn, in anticipation of your coming.~
@8 = ~NP: I am no ordinary ghost, though there is no shortage of ghosts in these halls..... I am a divine spirit sent by the god Latander to watch over this place until the day of judgment. And that day has come.~ /*I am a divine spirit sent by the god Lathander to watch over this place until the day of Judgment. And now that day has come...*/
@9 = ~Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...~
@10 = ~Tell me more...~
@11 = ~Get to the point, will you?~
@12 = ~It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival. The accused are confined in their towers beyond the north door. They are known as the brothers Jhareg, Karlat in the west tower and Quint within the east.~ /*It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival.*/
@13 = ~NP: You are the judge. I'll open the doors for you, examine the castle. When you have affidavits from both Jareg brothers, bring them to me to begin the trial.~ /*You are the Judge. Take this key and explore the castle. When you obtain the written oaths of the brothers Jhareg, present them to me so you may stand in Judgment.*/
@14 = ~I have some questions first, Spirit.~
@15 = ~Very well. I shall return to you with the oaths.~
@16 = ~I'm not your Judge and I'm *not* visiting your stupid towers!~
@17 = ~NP: You must find out from both of them what their crime was and get written oaths from them. When the oaths are in my hands, I will hear your sentence. I will open doors for you, behind which you will find staircases to both towers. Show wisdom, judge, and compassion for all of us....~ /*You must learn from them the nature of the crime and from them obtain their written oath. When both oaths are in my hands, I shall hear your Judgment.*/
@18 = ~Then ask them and I shall answer as Lathander gives me leave.~
@19 = ~Quint's one of the accused? Didn't I see him earlier?~
@20 = ~What is this crime over which I stand in Judgment?~
@21 = ~Will you accept any Judgment? Any at all?~
@22 = ~What if I choose to kill the brothers Jhareg?~
@23 = ~All right, enough questions.~
@24 = ~Then go into the night, dear Judge, and find the dawn we have awaited for so long.~

@26 = ~As you wish. We have waited this long without a dawn. We shall wait forever if we must. If you are not the Judge, the Judge shall come.~
@27 = ~Before the dark befell this castle, Quint Jhareg was Lathander's cleric. When the Morninglord sealed the towers, he allowed Quint to project an image of himself into the town below. Perhaps seeing the ghosts of the village was meant to be a special punishment for Quint or perhaps balm to soothe a wounded soul.~ /*Before the dark befell this castle, Quint Jhareg was Lathander's cleric. When the Morninglord sealed the towers, he allowed Quint to project an image of himself into the town below.*/
@28 = ~Lathander either loves or hates his fallen cleric. Either way, the Morninglord knew he held too great a bias to stand in Judgment over Quint's soul.~
@29 = ~By Lathander's will, I cannot say. In telling you of the horror, I might sway your Judgment. No, you must learn of it from the brothers themselves...~
@30 = ~How many Judgments can there be? There is guilt and there is innocence and consequences for them both.~
@31 = ~You do not have the power in this place. The castle has slipped through the weave of time. In the same moment that they die, they are reborn. Only I have the power to bring this place back into the weave and it is a power I cannot use until the Judge provides his Judgment.~ /*Only I have the power to bring this place back into the weave and it is a power I cannot use until the Judge provides his Judgment.*/
@32 = ~Then do you accept the role of Judge and the task of Judgment?~
@33 = ~Greetings, Judge. Do you bring with you the oaths of the brothers Jhareg?~ [NWGUA051]
@34 = ~Yep.~
@35 = ~No.~
@36 = ~Oaths? What oaths?~
@37 = ~Can you refresh my memory about what's going on here?~
@38 = ~Which oaths do you bear?~
@39 = ~Both Quint's and Karlat's.~
@40 = ~Quint's.~
@41 = ~Karlat's.~
@42 = ~Sorry, I was mistaken. I don't have either.~
@43 = ~Then come speak with me once you do.~
@44 = ~Ah, then perhaps you are not familiar with the sad tale of Castle Jhareg.~
@45 = ~Of course, Judge. You need but ask...~
@46 = ~This castle was once home to the brothers Jhareg. Now it stands trapped in time by Lathander, god of the dawn, in anticipation of your coming. Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...~ /*Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...*/
@47 = ~It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival. The accused are confined in their towers beyond the north door. They are known as the brothers Jhareg, Karlat in the west tower and Quint within the east.~ /*It was a mortal crime, requiring a mortal as its Judge. So it was that this Castle and its village were placed beyond the weave of time, awaiting your arrival.*/
@48 = ~Thank you. Are you prepared to stand in Judgment?~
@49 = ~Yes, I am ready.~
@50 = ~No, I still need time to think about it.~
@51 = ~Then that is both of them. Are you prepared to stand in Judgment?~
@52 = ~Then I shall hold it for you and keep it safe until you return with his brother's.~
@53 = ~Wise is the Judge who gives thought to his Judgment. Speak with me again when you are ready.~
@54 = ~Quint and Karlat Jhareg, I summon you unto the court of Judgment.~
@55 = ~I hold the oaths of the brothers Jhareg and this court requires only the presence of a Judge. Are you ready to stand in Judgment?~ [NWGUA052]
@56 = ~Judgment? I don't understand what's going on.~
@57 = ~NP: Ah, then perhaps you are still unfamiliar with the sad history of Jareg Castle. This castle once belonged to the Jareg brothers. Now it has been turned into a time trap by Latander, the God of Dawn, awaiting your arrival. Long ago, a crime was committed here, and the consequences were so terrible that Latander himself felt unable to execute judgment on these accused... It was the crime of mortals, and mortal was to be the judge. And so this castle and the village around it have been withdrawn from the flow of time to await your arrival.~ /*Long ago did the crime take place and so great were its consequences that Lathander himself felt unfit to stand in Judgment over those accused...*/
@58 = ~NP: The accused are imprisoned in their towers. They are known as the brothers Jareg, Carlat in the western tower and Quintus in the eastern tower. You must find out from both of them what their crime was and obtain written oaths from them. When the oaths are in my hands, I will hear your judgment. Show wisdom, judge, and compassion for all of us....~ /*You must learn from them the nature of the crime and from them obtain their written oath. When both oaths are in my hands, I shall hear your Judgment.*/
@59 = ~NP: I'm on full alert.~ /*Yes, I am ready.*/
@60 = ~NP: I need to think about it some more.~ /*No, I still need time to think about it.*/
@61 = ~You know well the charges that the Morninglord has brought against you: On a midwinter night, long ago, the children of Charwood were brought here and slaughtered. You, the accused, have each spoken in your defense and given your written oath to the Judge before you.~ /*You know well the charges that the Morninglord has brought against you: On a midwinter night, long ago, the children of Charwood were brought here and slaughtered.*/
@62 = ~Hold your tongue, Karlat Jhareg. You have had your say and given your oath. That is all this court requires of you. Now it is time for that Judge to decide the fate of us all... Judge, what is your ruling?~ /*Hold your tongue, Karlat Jhareg. You have had your say and given your oath. That is all this court requires of you.*/
@63 = ~I find Quint guilty. Give the phylactery to Karlat.~
@64 = ~I find Karlat guilty. Destroy the phylactery.~
@65 = ~I find neither Quint nor Karlat guilty of the crime.~
@66 = ~There is no denying that a great crime has been committed, Judge. What evidence do you bring that it was not at the hands of the brothers Jhareg?~
@67 = ~I have the written oath of the demon Belial.~
@68 = ~I have no evidence, Spirit.~
@69 = ~Indeed... Belial, Lord of Fire, I summon you unto the court of Judgment.~
@70 = ~If you have no evidence, then you cannot make such a Judgment. I must ask you to Judge again.~
@71 = ~Karlat, you have been found innocent in the Judge's eyes. Here is the phylactery stolen from you by your brother. Take it and go.~
@72 = ~Quint, you have been found innocent in the Judge's eyes. Be free from your madness and die knowing that your brother's soul shall not be tainted by undeath.~
@73 = ~I too thank you for my freedom, Judge. Long have I stood watch over this castle. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?~
@74 = ~It was simple. Quint admitted his own guilt.~
@75 = ~I found Karlat's cause to be most just.~
@76 = ~I chose randomly between them.~
@77 = ~The Judge's heart is <PRO_HISHER> alone. Ask no more.~
@78 = ~Karlat's story didn't hold up to scrutiny.~
@79 = ~I found Quint's cause to be most just.~
@80 = ~That much is true. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@81 = ~Yes, give me the Morninglord's account.~
@82 = ~NP: No. It's getting late.~ /*Server is already full.*/
@83 = ~Perhaps it was. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@84 = ~So be it. Sometimes Fate is the wisest Judge of all. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@85 = ~Wise is the Judge who sees beyond the surface. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@86 = ~It is done. To all assembled, then, Lathander declares this court adjourned. When you leave, I shall seal the castle doors and you shall never return... May the Judge always know the blessings of the Morninglord.~ /*When you leave, I shall seal the castle doors and you shall never return... May the Judge always know the blessings of the Morninglord.*/
@87 = ~That a slaughter of children happened within these walls one midwinter's night is beyond refute. Less clear, however, are the events that led to such a crime. Indeed, it was Quint Jhareg who gathered up the village children for a party within the castle library...~ /*That a slaughter of children happened within these walls one midwinter's night is beyond refute. Less clear, however, are the events that led to such a crime.*/
@88 = ~NP: But it was his brother, Carlat, who tricked him into doing it and started the slaughter with his spell.... Carlat wanted to become a noble baelorn, you see, and he was told that it required the blood of innocents....~ /*Karlat sought to become a noble baelnorn, you see, and had been told that the blood of innocents would be required...*/
@89 = ~It was the demon Belial who told him that lie, twisting Karlat's good intentions to an evil end...~
@90 = ~The phylactery was at the heart of it. Karlat needed it, Belial gave it, Quint stole it, Lathander confiscated it, I guarded it, and you Judged its fate.~
@91 = ~Long have I sensed that you, too, have been trapped within this castle. The Judge has produced your written confession and found you guilty.~
@92 = ~I stand guard over the phylactery by Lathander's will. The fate of that phylactery determines the fate of all who gather here. Even me. Even you. Decide, Judge. What shall be the fate of the phylactery?~ /*I stand guard over the phylactery by Lathander's will. The fate of that phylactery determines the fate of all who gather here. Even me. Even you.*/
@93 = ~I shall take the phylactery myself.~
@94 = ~You shall guard it as you always have, Spirit.~
@95 = ~By the Morninglord's power, I shall make it so, Judge. Take this vessel and guard it, unto the end of your days. With your Judgment, the souls of all gathered here are finally free of this place. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?~ /*With your Judgment, the souls of all gathered here are finally free of this place. I have but one question: What brought you to your Judgment?*/
@96 = ~We all must be free, be it to do evil or good.~
@97 = ~I didn't realize this would be the consequence.~
@98 = ~But - But Judge... No, I shall not argue the Judgment... Just know that, in making it, you have cursed all of us gathered here. Here we shall stay, forever exiled from the weave of time to live out our endless lives in madness and decay. So have you Judged, so shall it be.~ /*Here we shall stay, forever exiled from the weave of time to live out our endless lives in madness and decay. So have you Judged, so shall it be.*/
@99 = ~NP: I just have one question: What made the judge give that particular sentence?~ /*I have but one question left: What brought this Judge to <PRO_HISHER> Judgment?*/
@100 = ~In their own way, everyone is guilty.~
@101 = ~Well-spoken, then, and not without merit. Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@102 = ~Then may woe follow you, Judge, wherever you may go... Do you wish now to hear Lathander's version of this tragedy?~
@103 = ~NP: Very good. In that case, for all those present, the judge will declare this meeting adjourned. When you leave, I will seal the castle doors and you will never return....~ /*Very well. To all assembled, then, the Judge declares this court adjourned.*/
