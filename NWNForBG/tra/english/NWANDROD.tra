@0 = ~No! Please! Whatever you're here for, just take it and go! Tell Mistress Ophala that I'm sorry I caused her distress! I'm sorry!~
@1 = ~Relax, I'm not here to hurt you.~
@2 = ~Who said I was here because of Ophala? Who is that?~
@3 = ~Yes, I'm here because of Ophala, just like you said.~
@4 = ~You've opened my doors, sullied my home, and you're probably rife with plague! You've already hurt me! All for that blasted statue! So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!~
@5 = ~Your valuables!! Where are they !!! NOW!!!~
@6 = ~Where is this statue she wants? Why is it important?~
@7 = ~I swear she didn't send me here.~
@8 = ~I'm going now.~
@9 = ~Don't lie to me! I know! She's wanted that statue for years, and now you show up here, a thug in my home! Of course she sent you! So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!~ /*So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!*/
@10 = ~Of course you are! I wouldn't believe you if you said you weren't. She's wanted that statue for years, and now you show up here, a thug in my home! So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!~ /*So don't play dumb or cute, I know what this is about. Tell her I'm sorry, and that I won't bother her again! Take the damned statue and just get out!*/
@11 = ~Everywhere! It's my home! There's a key around here somewhere! It opens everything! JUST DON'T TOUCH ME!!!~
@12 = ~NP: I swear Ofala didn't send me here.~ /*I swear she didn't send me here.*/
@13 = ~If she didn't send you, I'll pay dearly for saying anything. If she did send you, she'd have told you if you were supposed to know. Suffice it to say that if you take the matron of the Moonstone Mask to a ball, make sure you don't leave with her sister. No amount of tributary artwork will save your hide from her wrath. Just take it. The statue is in my dresser, along with a master key for most of my locks.~ /*Suffice it to say that if you take the matron of the Moonstone Mask to a ball, make sure you don't leave with her sister.*/
@14 = ~It doesn't matter. You're either here for the statue or you're a thief and you'll take it anyway. Either way, I don't have to deal with it anymore.~
@15 = ~Take what you want. Just don't hurt me. I don't want anyone here, and I sure don't want Ophala breathing down my neck anymore! There's a key around here somewhere that will unlock everything... or just smash it all, I don't care. Just don't touch me!~ /*Take what you want. Just don't hurt me. I don't want anyone here, and I sure don't want Ophala breathing down my neck anymore!*/
@16 = ~What? Who... ? Ruffian! Please, get away!~
