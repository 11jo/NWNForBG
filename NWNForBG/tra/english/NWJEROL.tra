@0 = ~Welcome to my humble store. Before we continue, I draw your attention to my guards, and my many warning devices. I hold nothing against those that make their living as thieves, but I will not be a target. I need to make a living too.~ 
@1 = ~Of course. Have you got anything interesting?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I have the standard selection of gear. I have other things as well, but they are probably not of interest to you. You are a guard, aren't you?~
@4 = ~Just show me normal stuff.~
@5 = ~How will you know if you don't show me? Come on.~
@6 = ~Another time. Goodbye~
@7 = ~A pleasure doing business. Do come back again.~
@8 = ~Here, take a look.~ 
@9 = ~The majority of my special stock is in the market facilities of Seedy Tavern... if you have the right coins to pay. Smugglers' Coins.~
@10 = ~But I don't have those coins anymore. I'm really sorry.~ 
@11 = ~Where can I get more?~ 
@12 = ~Just show me normal stuff.~
@13 = ~Thank you for your time, then.~
@14 = ~I happen to have a small supply. 350 gold per coin. Steep, I know, but if you need them, you'll pay.~ 
@15 = ~Very well, I will purchase three.~
@16 = ~Very well, I will purchase two.~
@17 = ~Very well, I will purchase one.~
@18 = ~Where can I get more if I need them?~
@19 = ~That is an insane price! There must be a cheaper way!~
@20 = ~They are in short supply, but... perhaps you will do me a favor some day, hmm? I shall tell you a possibility. Gilda at the Golden Apple. I get the occasional coin from her. She does not know what they are, bless her. There you might get one... or two... My price will not lower, but I will help you this way. Good luck.~ 
@21 = ~More business! I am certainly busy this day, even with the streets so dangerous. I have the standard selection of gear. I have other things as well, but they are probably not of interest to you.~
