@0 = ~No, please no more! I surrender!~
@1 = ~I don't know what is going on. Where am I? Where are my clothes?~
@2 = ~What are you talking about? And why did you attack me?~
@3 = ~Who are you?~
@4 = ~I... I don't remember attacking you. I don't even know who you are or where this is. The last thing I remember is walking through the Wood trying to figure out what went wrong with all the animals. I had avoided several bears and a few boars, but I was getting very tired. I stumbled into an open glade and... I saw... I think it was a woman. A beautiful woman, yes, that's it.~ 
@5 = ~That's the last I remember. Next thing I know, you were attacking me, although you say I was the one who attacked. This is all very confusing.~
@6 = ~Don't you remember anything about your captivity?~
@7 = ~Let me ask you some questions about what you knew before you were captured.~
@8 = ~All right, you should get out of here now.~
@9 = ~I think you are trying to trick me. Die foolish man!~
@10 = ~I am a ranger here in... um... is this Neverwinter Wood? I don't recognize this place.~
@11 = ~Yes, this is the Wood. Why did you just attack me?~
@12 = ~I am asking the questions here. You should have known better than to attack me.~
@13 = ~Hm... no, I don't remember a thing, sorry.~
@14 = ~I will try, although I can't promise anything. I hadn't learned very much.~
@15 = ~What did you discover about what is happening to the animals in the Wood?~
@16 = ~There are some druids missing. Do you know what happened to them?~
@17 = ~I heard about a witch named Setara. What do you know about her?~
@18 = ~Thank you. Good luck sir.~
@19 = ~I just won't give up.~
@20 = ~There is nothing much to tell. I couldn't speak to them or calm them. They are just extremely hostile. I never had the opportunity to find out more.~
@21 = ~I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps you should search this place, but be careful, since they might attack you too, if they're like I was.~
@22 = ~I have heard a little bit about her. She likes to help the forest creatures, but she doesn't have much contact with people. There is some story about how she used to be beautiful, but suddenly turned ugly. That's all I know about her.~
