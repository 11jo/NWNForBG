@0 = ~Welcome, friend. I am Yusam, Druid of the North, liaison between the Lords' Alliance and the Uthgardt. You are free to take solace in the tranquility of my grove, if you wish. Or is there some other reason you have sought me out?~ [NWYUSA63] 
@1 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I work for Aarin Gend.~
@2 = ~What is a druid doing up here on this plateau?~
@3 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~I'd like to purchase some supplies.~
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~When the Lords' Alliance set up camp here Aarin told me he was recruiting agents to search for lost artifacts of ancient magic. I wish you success in your quest, though as I told Aarin I am more concerned with the plight of the Uthgardt people.~ 
@7 = ~Plight of the Uthgardt? What do you mean?~
@8 = ~This land and its people are under my protection and care. That is why the plight of the Uthgardt troubles me so. Their suffering is like a thorn in my heart.~
@9 = ~Plight of the Uthgardt? What do you mean?~
@10 = ~I know the ways of the living forest and the mysteries of the turning of the season, but as to worldy affairs I admit my knowledge is quite limited. I try not to let such affairs intrude upon the tranquility of my grove. I would ask that you also leave your problems behind when you come here, my child. This place is a refuge from the outside world. The Uthgardt come so they might escape the plight of their people. They do not need you to remind them of such things.~ 
@11 = ~You are welcome to see my stock, where you will find not only those treasures gathered from the glorious bounty of nature, but also those items oft-used by nature's servants.~
@12 = ~Go, child, and may a gentle breeze carry you safely to your destination, like the summer winds that bring seeds to replenish the eternal forest.~
@13 = ~My child, this war takes a terrible toll on the Uthgardt. The armies of Luskan lay waste to their lands and the Black Lion tribe has lost many warriors battling alongside the Lords' Alliance soldiers.~
@14 = ~And as I have already told you, the Elk tribe has aligned itself with the Luskan forces for reasons I cannot fathom.~
@15 = ~The Elk tribe are no more. I have slain their Chieftain.~
@16 = ~Commander Damas has infected the Elk tribe with the plague.~
@17 = ~Zokan, leader of the Elk tribe, asked me to show this dreamcatcher to you.~
@18 = ~But it is for the Uthgardt Elk tribe that I worry most of all. They have aligned themselves with the Luskan destroyers to slaughter the defenseless settlers around Fort Ilkard in the south.~
@19 = ~You're a druid. Can't you make them stop?~
@20 = ~Alas, it is as I feared. Zokan was not to be reasoned with, his tribe had fallen in with the evil of Luskan forces. I thank you for this news, though it brings me great pain to hear. You have done as I asked, my child, and investigated this matter for me. As such, you have earned your reward. I do not have much to give, but please accept this ring for your efforts.~ 

@22 = ~Commander Damas is well known for his cruelty, but I did not suspect even he of such a vile act! Alas, there is little I can do as I have none of the plague cure with me. But Damas is no fool. If he were to infect the Elk tribe, he would want to have the cure handy in case his own people contracted the plague. Perhaps you could speak to Damas and convince him give you the cure. I fear there is no other way to save the Elk tribe.~ 
@23 = ~I'll go speak to Damas at once!~
@24 = ~I looked into this like you asked. This your problem now, Yusam.~
@25 = ~I recognize this Elk tribe token. It is a symbol of truce and contrition. It must mean that Zokan is apologizing for what his tribe has done. I will send my emissaries at once to reestablish relations with the Elk people. You have done as I asked, my child, and investigated this matter for me. As such, you have earned your reward. I do not have much to give, but please accept this ring for your efforts.~ 

@27 = ~Once, the Elk tribe welcomed my counsel, but they have since turned their back on the way of nature. The emissaries I have sent to investigate have all been ruthlessly slain.~
@28 = ~May the blessings of my sacred grove be with you on this mission.~
@29 = ~You offered your aid in this matter, my child, and the job is but half done. A seed can be planted, but that alone will not cause the tree to take root and grow. There is no one else I may turn to in this matter, my child. If you can help the Elk tribe I promise your reward will be worth your efforts.~ 
@30 = ~Forget it.~
@31 = ~As a fellow servant of the forest and a true child of nature you can no doubt understand my distress.~
@32 = ~As a servant of nature I am honored to investigate this matter for you, Yusam of the Grove!~
@33 = ~I could help you with this... for a price.~
@34 = ~You are not a child of nature, so perhaps you cannot understand the pain I feel over what has happened with the Elk tribe.~
@35 = ~Perhaps I could investigate this for you, Yusam.~
@36 = ~I cannot force you to aid me in this matter, my child, though I hope in time the flower of charity will bloom in your heart and change your mind. In the meantime is there anything else I can do for you, child?~ 
@37 = ~Such a task would be dangerous, my child. The Elk tribe have slain all who have tried to parlay with them. But if you could discover why the Elk tribe have turned their back on us I would be most grateful. The Elk tribe have fortified themselves inside their keep to the west of Fort Ilkard, although they continue to make raids on the fort. Perhaps if you go there you can find them and speak to Zokan Thunderer, their chief.~ 
@38 = ~I'll be back when I learn more of the Elk tribe.~
@39 = ~In the natural cycle good deeds bring good deeds in return. Should you find a way to bring the Elk tribe back into the fold you will be showered with an abundant bounty of rewards.~
@40 = ~Your offer is generous, child. I cannot leave this grove, and there is nowhere else I may turn for aid. I fear, however, that you do not truly understand what you are about to undertake.~

@42 = ~It always pleases me when a fellow child of nature chooses to partake of the beauty of my grove.~ [NWYUSA62]
@43 = ~Welcome, my child. Do you bring me news of the Uthgardt Elk tribe? Or is there some other purpose to your visit?~ [NWYUSA60]
@44 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. I will always be grateful to you for your aid in the difficult matter of the Elk. Have you come here seeking a tranquil refuge from the outside world? Or is there perhaps some other reason for your visit?~ [NWYUSA59] 
@45 = ~Well met once again, my child. Have you come to enjoy the peace and solitude of my grove? Or is there some other purpose for which you have come to seek me out once more?~ [NWYUSA61] 
@46 = ~Who are you again?~
@47 = ~I am Yusam, Druid of the North. I am the liaison between the Lords' Alliance and the Uthgardt tribes.~
