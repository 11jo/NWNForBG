@0 = ~NP: Don't bother me. I didn't ask for this job, and I don't need it. Just say the password and go in like everyone else. And don't ask me for any key. If you know the password, you must have your own key. I don't.~ /*Now don't go bothering me. I didn't want this job and I don't need this job. Just say the password and get moving, like all the rest.*/
@1 = ~Who are you? What do you do?~
@2 = ~You wish a password?~
@3 = ~Can I ask about the Tavern and what's below it?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~NP: Who, me? I'm a cook, and those Bloody Sailors put me here to guard the door because they've already lost too many men to the pestilence. I don't care about that. I prefer to cook. Now, if you know the password, speak up.~ /*Who, me? I'm the chef, and these Bloodsailors have me guarding the door because they've lost too many regular members to the plague.*/
@6 = ~The password is "Cornerstone."~
@7 = ~If you don't care, how about just forgetting it?~
@8 = ~Well, handsome, maybe we can... work something out?~
@9 = ~Will some gold make you forget you need a password?~
@10 = ~You'll let me pass or I'll feed you your spine!~
@11 = ~I don't know the password.~
@12 = ~Yes, fool, a password. If that door gets opened before I've heard a password, I'm supposed to call the guards. Now, out with it.~
@13 = ~Look, I'm just the chef. I'm replacing a Bloodsailor that died of plague. If you have business downstairs, fine. Just give me the password and go.~
@14 = ~Don't bother me again. It's bad enough I have to stand around here all day.~
@15 = ~NP: Okay, that works for me. Actually, it's not too bad for this night. If you have anyone with you, they can come in too. I'm sick of watching their stupid door. I've done my time, now I'm leaving.~ /*Right, good enough for me. In fact, that's good enough for the night. Anyone else with you, they can go on in as well.*/
@16 = ~NP: You know, I think you're right. Damn those passwords to hell! I'm not their guardian! I'm not their butler! You want to go through the door, go ahead. In fact, I'll even tell everyone you know the password.~ /*You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.*/
@17 = ~No, I don't think that would be the best thing for me to do. I'm no guard, but these Bloodsailors are rough customers.~
@18 = ~NP: Well, I just can't say no to a pretty face like that. Ah, to the abyss, everyone. I'm not a guard. Why did they even ask me to stand here? You want to go through the door, go ahead. In fact, I'll even tell everyone you know the password.~ /*Well now, I've never been able to say no to a pretty face. Ah, what the hell. I'm no guard. Why did they even ask me to do this?*/
@19 = ~I don't know about that. The fact that you need to ask means you shouldn't be here.~
@20 = ~How about 50 gold to look the other way?~
@21 = ~How about 100 gold to look the other way?~
@22 = ~200 gold should get you to forget me, hmm?~
@23 = ~I was only testing. I meant nothing by it.~
@24 = ~What? No thank you! I'm not fighting over this! Guards! Guards!~
@25 = ~Then get lost, and don't bother me again. If you don't know the password, then you aren't supposed to be here.~
@26 = ~They can watch their own bloody doors. Damn right.~
@27 = ~Of course, you'll still need to open the door. I don't know nothing about that. If you should be down there, you probably have your own key.~
@28 = ~NP: I think this will do. I like you, and anyway, what am I doing here by this door? I'm the cook! You want to go through the door, go ahead. In fact, I'll even tell everyone you know the password.~ /*You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.*/
@29 = ~NP: I think that'll be enough. I mean, why did they even ask me to guard that door?! I'm a cook. Cook! You want to go through the door, go ahead. In fact, I'll even tell everyone you know the password.~ /*I think that would suffice. I mean, why are they asking me to guard the door anyway? I'm a chef. A chef!*/
@30 = ~No, I don't think I want to risk my neck for that amount. I don't much like you. Can you do better?~
@31 = ~NP: Seems like a good deal. I mean, why did they even ask me to guard that door? I'm the cook! You want to go through the door, go ahead. In fact, I'll even tell everyone you know the password.~ /*You want to go through that door, you go right ahead. In fact, I'll even tell anyone that asks that you knew the password.*/
@32 = ~Does that mean you know the password or not?~
@33 = ~NP: Yeah, so who opened the door? I don't let anyone in without a password, whether they have a key or not. Of course, not that I care. Why they put a cook guarding that stupid door, who knows.~ /*Of course, it's not like I care that much. Why they got the chef to guard this stupid door, I'll never know.*/
@34 = ~Don't bother me, all right? I did my part with the door and I don't care who goes through now.~
