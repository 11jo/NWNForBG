@0 = ~There is nothing like living in dangerous times to test one's strength of heart! Do you agree, stranger?~
@1 = ~Yes! I challenge fate daily to prove myself worthy.~
@2 = ~Uh... sure. I guess you like to fight?~
@3 = ~I think I would rather live in a nice, peaceful age.~
@4 = ~Excellent! I will buy you a drink later, when I am not on duty. Of course, in the defense of nature, I am always on duty. Ha! Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ 
@5 = ~What's going on here?~
@6 = ~What do you do here?~
@7 = ~I guess that's okay. Goodbye.~ 
@8 = ~It is the responsibility of one who follows nature. The strong survive and the only way to become stronger is to pit yourself against worthy adversaries. Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ 
@9 = ~Bah! And what price comes with peace? Weakness! Life gets easy, people get fat and lazy, then someone with real strength comes along and takes everything. That's how nature works. Do you really think that everything can be solved by sitting around and hoping problems will just go away?~ 
@10 = ~No. There is a time for fighting and a time for talking, but a wise person knows the difference.~
@11 = ~There is very little that one cannot accomplish using the mind instead of the body.~
@12 = ~It's small-minded people like you who cause war and destruction in the world.~
@13 = ~You keep getting in my face and I'll show you how the strong survive!~
@14 = ~Well, because of you, everything has pretty much returned to normal around here. Anything else?~
@15 = ~Everyone is working hard to recover from the death of the Spirit. It will be a long haul, but it's a battle worth fighting. Anything else?~
@16 = ~Right now, the latest fight facing us is with the Spirit of the Wood. It is driving the animals to attack everyone and everything in an insane fashion. There is no pleasure in slaughtering maddened animals. I suggest you go and talk to Aawill about it, if you want to help. He's in charge of the investigation. I have enough to do around here.~ 
@17 = ~All right. Goodbye.~
@18 = ~I am in charge of the druid circle challenges. When a druid wants to become a member of our grove, he or she must challenge one of our members to gain entry to the first circle.~
@19 = ~Can I challenge one of the druids?~
@20 = ~Go and test yourself against a worthy opponent. It will stiffen your spine and make you stronger.~
@21 = ~Challenging the mind is a part of growth. But do not forget: strong of body, strong of mind, they work together to form the perfect whole. Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ 
@22 = ~And on that note, I think this conversation is over. Come back when you decide to change your mind. Goodbye.~
@23 = ~Excellent! You prove my point through your actions. I was worried that you might be one of those foolish and weak pacifists! Now what is it that I can do for you today?~ 
@24 = ~While I respect your desire, only a druid from our grove may challenge and become a member. One day you're here, the next day you're gone. Farewell.~
@25 = ~I see you are back. Is there anything I can help you with?~
@26 = ~You've decided to help our forest? A glorious battle awaits you. May Silvanus be with you.~
@27 = ~Well, because of you, everything has pretty much returned to normal around here. It must have been a glorious battle.~
@28 = ~Everyone is working hard to recover from the death of the Spirit. It will be a long haul, but it's a battle worth fighting.~
