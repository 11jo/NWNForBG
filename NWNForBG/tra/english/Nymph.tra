@0 = ~MT: No, I won't let you kill me! Creatures of nature must be protected, obey my will!~ /*No, I will not allow you to kill me! Nature's creatures must be protected.*/
@1 = ~Foolish <PRO_MANWOMAN>! I don't know why you thought you could just steal into my house, kill my slaves and destroy another of nature's protectors, but now you have fallen to my charms. Now, bow to your mistress!~
@2 = ~What are you talking about? I'm not a slave.~
@3 = ~Yes mistress. What is your command?~
@4 = ~MT: If you tried to subdue me with your charms, you lost. Try again if you want to die..~ /*If you were trying to dominate me with your powers, you have failed. If you want to die, just try to pull that again.*/
@5 = ~I am not your slave, villianous creature. Prepare yourself for death.~
@6 = ~Don't talk back to me slave! Now, what menial task should I put you to work at?~
@7 = ~MT: If you tried to subdue me with your charms, you lost. Try again if you want to die.~ /*If you were trying to dominate me with your powers, you have failed. If you want to die, just try to pull that again.*/
@8 = ~I am not your slave, villianous creature. Prepare yourself for death.~
@9 = ~First, you can go and clean up any mess you made while getting in here. After that, you can go and collect all of the chamber pots and clean them out. Before you go, I want you to put on this cute little outfit.~
@10 = ~Menial labor? I don't think so!~
@11 = ~Cleaning out your chamber pots? That's disgusting, forget it.~
@12 = ~I'm not wearing that! It's pink!!!~
@13 = ~No! How is this possible? What has happened to my powers?~
@14 = ~MT: You and your slaves attacked me. Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you?~ /*Me attacked by you and your slaves. Why me not kill you now, huh?*/
@15 = ~MT: Yes, I do not care about your strength. They are not, and now answer, what is going on here?~ /*Come on, we're both <PRO_RACE> kind. What's going on?*/
@16 = ~No, please! Please don't hurt me. What have I done to provoke this attack on my home?~
@17 = ~You attacked me! I didn't start this.~
@18 = ~MT: Your slaves attacked me, then you did the same. This is not enough?~ /*Your slaves attacked me and then you did the same thing. How is this my fault?*/
@19 = ~You are the one who started this, but now I will finish it!~
@20 = ~MT: What? How dare you object to me! You are my brainless ra... you... you are deceiving me! No! How can it be? What happened to my powers?~ /*What? How dare you talk back to me! You're my unthinking sla... you... you tricked me!*/
@21 = ~You... you mean you didn't come here to destroy me?~
@22 = ~Of course not! I came here looking for a way to help the Spirit of the Wood.~
@23 = ~I came here to talk and was attacked before I had the chance. Why would you think I came here to kill you?~
@24 = ~Then I call upon nature's power to defend myself.~
@25 = ~Oh, this is terrible. I'm so sorry, but I was certain that you... oh, I don't know why I thought that now. There is nothing I can do to make up for this. I was wrong; how is that possible?~
@26 = ~You were here to kill me. That was what I thought the moment I felt your presence near my tree. I... I just wanted to stop you. Could you ever forgive me?~
@27 = ~I guess I can forgive you, but I expect you to help me in any way you can now.~
@28 = ~MT: I can't forgive you, but I won't touch you unless you throw something else away.~ /*That's a pretty horrible mistake. I can't forgive you, but I won't hurt you unless you try something again.*/
@29 = ~There can be no forgiveness for what you have done, there can be only death.~
@30 = ~Oh thank you <PRO_LADYLORD>! You are very kind. I will do whatever I can to help you. I just wish I still had my powers, I don't know why they have become so weakened.~
@31 = ~How long have you been having trouble?~
@32 = ~You still had enough power to control your slaves.~
@33 = ~I will do as you command. I only wish I had some way to make it up to you. Without my powers, there is very little I can do.~
@34 = ~MT: A couple of weeks ago, I was down by the river, watching the fish play, and suddenly I felt some kind of danger. I looked around, then climbed up the bank and took cover in a grove of trees. I couldn't see anything, but the fear was growing. Suddenly, there was a scream in my head, as if someone had plunged a dagger right into my brain. His strength so impressed me that I fell to the ground unconscious. When I woke up, the fear was still there, and also the feeling that the whole forest was in pain.~ /*Suddenly there was a scream in my mind that felt like someone had stabbed a dagger into my brain. I was overcome by the power of it and I fell to the ground unconscious. When I woke up, the fear was still there, and the sense that the whole forest was in pain.*/
@35 = ~What could have caused that?~
@36 = ~Just barely. My ability to control them has been weakening for a while now.~
@37 = ~MT: It was the Spirit of the Forest. Since that day, I have always felt his pain and fear. He is constantly screaming for help. I did everything to keep my sanity; indeed, I think you have experienced the hardships of me losing this battle. As time went on, I began to stay closer to home, until recently I found that I could not leave my room at all, so great was my fear.~ /*It was the Spirit of the Wood. I have been sensing its pain and fear ever since that day. It is constantly screaming for help. It is all I can do to keep my sanity; indeed I guess you have experienced just how I am losing that battle.*/
@38 = ~If it is so bad, then why don't you leave?~
@39 = ~MT: Well, you got it. I think everyone would have mental problems.~ /*You have suffered greatly. I suppose anyone would have trouble retaining their sanity.*/
@40 = ~You must be weak, if you give in so easily and enslave other's minds.~
@41 = ~It is not so simple as that. This tree is my home, I have been here for centuries. I feel as though every person who comes along is a danger to both my home and myself.~
@42 = ~That is very comforting to hear you say. I... I feel as though you give me strength. The fear is not as consuming when we speak. Uh... well, I guess there is more I should tell you.~
@43 = ~MT: You have never had to feel something in your head that affects your emotions and tries to force you to submit to it. You despise me so much, maybe I should... It doesn't matter. I apologize for this disruption. Should I continue?~ /*You have never had a presence in your mind that could affect your emotions and try to command you to do what it wants. You despise me so much, maybe I should...*/
@44 = ~I'm sorry. I guess I just have a hard time accepting when others have attacked me. Go on.~
@45 = ~Just keep going and try to limit the whining.~
@46 = ~I'm sick of your whining, that'll be enough. Goodbye.~
@47 = ~The first time a person came near my tree, I took him with my power and kept him to guard my home. The next few were easy too, but they started to get harder and harder. Now I have no power left, as you can see. I don't know what to do now.~
@48 = ~If I'm going to help you, I need to get to the Spirit of the Wood. Do you know how I could do that?~
@49 = ~To do my job, I need to get to the Spirit of the Wood. Can you help me?~
@50 = ~I... I really am sorry for what I have done. If you ever need anything, please return.~
@51 = ~I don't think that's possible. The Spirit is a creature of both life and death, and only he can enter the portal to the other realm.~
@52 = ~What does that mean, both life and death?~
@53 = ~There must be a way! Where is this portal?~
@54 = ~The Spirit lives on another realm, somewhere between the world of the living and the world of the dead. It is the only creature on this plane who can enter the portal.~
@55 = ~The portal is in a pool, below a waterfall, but finding it won't help you. It wouldn't help anyone.~
@56 = ~MT: And are you sure that no one entered there except the Spirit?~ /*Are you sure revenge will be so satisfying?*/
@57 = ~There has got to be a way for me to get there.~
@58 = ~Well... several have tried... but no... that's not a good solution. Forget it. The Spirit is the only one who can do so successfully.~
@59 = ~You were going to say something else. You must tell me, please.~
@60 = ~Tell me what you were going to say, or you'll be sorry you didn't.~
@61 = ~MT: Long ago, there was a druid who claimed to have figured out how to get into the reality of Spirit. He said that he studied the puzzle for many years, and in the end it worked out. He didn't tell me how he was going to enter, but I was curious and followed him. He went into the pond and built an altar, but then he did a very strange thing! He drew a dagger and plunged it into his own chest. His body slid under the water, but when I got to the pond, it was gone.~ /*There was a druid, a long time ago, who claimed he had figured out how to enter the Spirit's realm. He said he had been studying it for years and had finally pieced it together. He didn't tell me how he was going to enter, but I was curious, so I followed him.*/
@62 = ~You don't have to threaten me, I told you I would do as you command.~
@63 = ~Maybe he made it to the realm, but if he was dead when he got there, I'm not sure it was worth it. Others have tried it through the years, but their bodies just lay there decomposing. Well... most of the others.~
@64 = ~What do you mean, most of the others? This is important.~
@65 = ~Just tell me everything you know and stop wasting my time!~
@66 = ~MT: A dwarf came here a few weeks ago. He was furious and it seemed to me that my charms did not work on him. He asked me about the dagger with which the druid killed himself. I do not know how he knew about this druid, but I kept the dagger as a memory of him. When the dwarf began to threaten me, I had to give him the dagger.~ /*A dwarf came here a few weeks ago. He was fierce and mean and seemed immune to my charms. He asked me about the dagger that the druid had used to kill himself.*/
@67 = ~I never saw the dwarf again, but shortly before everything started going wrong in the forest, I found the dagger in front of the altar.~
@68 = ~I need that dagger. Do you have it?~
@69 = ~MT: Neverwinter Forest: Spirit of the Forest The spirit of Neverwinter Forest has been poisoned, and Aaville, the archdruid of the local druid conclave, is seriously concerned. He gave us access to the forest, hoping that we would help him figure out what was wrong. In the depths of the forest, information was found about the existence of a pond near the waterfall, where the Spirit of the Forest performed a ritual to get into the world of spirits. For a mortal, the only way to follow him is to enter the pond and die in its waters. In order to deprive a mortal of life, a magical dagger is required.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Woods has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried. He has reluctantly granted forest access to adventurers so that they might help him right whatever has gone wrong.
Evidence discovered deeper in the forest tells of a pool at the base of a waterfall where the Spirit of the Woods would perform a ritual to enter the spirit world. The only way for mortals to follow is to enter that pool and die while in its waters. A magical dagger is obviously involved in the taking of one's life.*/
@70 = ~MT: Was the dwarf's body in the pool?~ /*Was the dwarf's body in the pool?*/
@71 = ~MT: I brought him here too, but I don't remember where he went, because as soon as I managed to get home, a sharp pain pierced me. But he is definitely somewhere in my house. If you look hard enough, you can probably find it, but don't use it! I don't want to be responsible for another death, I already have blood up to my elbows!~ /*I'm sure it's somewhere in my house though. If you look around, you should be able to find it, but you shouldn't use it! I don't want another death on my hands; they are so bloody already.*/
@72 = ~Is there anything else you can tell me that might help?~
@73 = ~It's okay. I'm going to find the Spirit and help you escape this fear.~
@74 = ~Don't start whining again. Get some backbone.~
@75 = ~I don't think I can listen to you anymore. Goodbye.~
@76 = ~No, now that you mention it, his corpse wasn't there.~
@77 = ~I can't think of anything else that would help, but I will answer any questions you have.~
@78 = ~MT: In one of your rooms, there was a druid who was enchanted by you. Do you know where the rest of the druids are?~ /*I met the druid you had locked up in the other room. Do you know about the other missing druids?*/
@79 = ~What do you know about the witch, Setara?~
@80 = ~Do you have the mirror that Setara is seeking?~
@81 = ~Could you tell me your story again?~
@82 = ~That's all I can think of for now. Farewell.~
@83 = ~You have a strength within you that burns away the mask of terror that has shrouded my life these past days. I hope... it sounds presumptuous I'm sure, but I really hope that I may call you a friend.~
@84 = ~You're not well loved are you?~
@85 = ~It is just as well. I would like to be alone now. I hope you can help save the Spirit.~
@86 = ~MT: I'm really sorry if the other druids are missing, but I don't know anything about them. The elf was the last one I captured with my power before testing it on you. I couldn't even completely enslave him - I had to renew the enchantment every time I entered the room where he was kept. I really regret keeping him locked up, but I was afraid that when he realized that he was under a spell, he would want to kill me.~ /*I couldn't even keep him dominated, but had to renew my domination anytime I went into the room I kept him in. I feel very guilty about locking him up, but I was afraid that once he realized I had dominated him, he would want to kill me.*/
@87 = ~MT: Oh, she's a terribly ugly old hag. You don't want to do business with her at all. I can't even look at her without crying, so I didn't let her near my tree at all. I don't even like to talk about it, it irritates me so much. Is there anything else I can do?~ /*Oh, she is a terribly ugly old crone. You don't want to have anything to do with her. I can't even bear to look on her, so I refuse to allow her anywhere near my tree. I don't even like to talk about her, it disturbs me that much.*/
@88 = ~I have a magic mirror, but it just shows the person what they wish they looked like, not what they actually look like. It certainly wouldn't make anyone young again. I suppose it would be a sort of wish fulfillment for someone as ugly as that old crone though.~
@89 = ~If it will help you in your quest to save the Spirit, then you can certainly have it. Is there anything else you need?~
@90 = ~MT: My power is waning and I've become more and more panicky since the Spirit began to take over my mind. I don't know what all this trouble is about, but if you find the Spirit, you can find the answers. The Spirit can be reached through a portal that is hidden under a waterfall here in the woods. The only one who may have passed through this portal was a druid who entered the pond and killed himself.~ /*My powers have been weakening and I have been becoming more and more fearful ever since the Spirit started to take control of my mind. I don't know what caused the problem, but if you can reach the Spirit, you may find some answers.*/
@91 = ~MT: But I have no real proof that he got there. I think it would be very foolish to repeat this, because the dead can do little. I don't think I know anything useful anymore, but I'll answer any questions you have.~ /*I have no real evidence that he made it though. I think such an act would be very foolish, since you can't do too much if you are dead.*/
@92 = ~Good luck in your quest. I am truly sorry for the harm I brought you and for the death of my slaves, for which I am wholly to blame.~
@93 = ~I see you have returned. Just seeing your face again makes my soul ache from the death I brought about in my paranoia. Is there something else I can do for you?~
@94 = ~Nature's hero returns triumphant! I am sure that your confidence and courage shall be an inspiration to all who serve nature's purpose.~
@95 = ~Killer of the Spirit! I cannot believe that you would return to the Wood after the damage you have done to it. I will not speak to you anymore!~
@96 = ~MT: Neverwinter Forest: Spirit of the Forest The spirit of Neverwinter Forest has been in a sorry state of late, and Archdruid Aavill, who leads the conclave, is very concerned about this. With great reluctance, he allowed us to enter his forest, in the hope that we would help him find out what had happened.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Wood has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried. He has reluctantly granted forest access to adventurers so that they might help him right whatever has gone wrong.*/
@97 = ~MT: Neverwinter Forest: Spirit of the Forest The Spirit of the Neverwinter Forest has been in a sorry state of late, and Archdruid Aavill, who leads the conclave, is very concerned about this. With great reluctance, he allowed us to enter the forest, in the hope that we would help him find out what had happened. Other druids in the depths of the forest say that you can see the Spirit first by entering, and then leaving the forest pond, and performing some kind of ritual. However, they have no idea what the ritual might be.~ /*The Spirit of the Neverwinter Wood has somehow come to harm and Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, is gravely worried. He has reluctantly granted forest access to adventurers so that they might help him right whatever has gone wrong.
Other druids deeper in the forest speak of having seen the Spirit entering and leaving a pool of water, as if part of some ritual. What that ritual may be remains unclear, however.*/
