@0 = ~Greetings, friend! Husher Clay at your service. Care to check out the wares here at this, the newest branch of my adventuring gear shops?~
@1 = ~What do you mean, the newest branch?~
@2 = ~I'd like to take a look at your inventory.~
@3 = ~I'm searching for the Words of Power.~
@4 = ~NP: Well, I had a little store down south. Business was good, but you can't make much money without expansion. So I left my son in charge of the store and came here to grow my trading empire. When I saw all these rich adventurers gathered here at Beorunn's Well, I knew it was the perfect place to open a new store, at least until I could get a license that would allow me to trade in Neverwinter.~ /*When I came across all these rich adventurers gathered here in Beorunna's Well, I figured this was the perfect place to set up my new shop, at least until I get a license to sell in Neverwinter.*/
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~By all means! I never turn a customer away.~
@7 = ~NP: Alas, I'm afraid I don't have that in stock. Ha-ha! But seriously, I really don't know anything about it. Maybe you should talk to Lillian Cambridge, that archaeologist Aaryn Gend brought in. From what I've heard, she spends most of her time in the tavern.~ /*You might want to speak with Lillian Cambridge, that archeological expert Aarin Gend brought in. She spends most of her time at the tavern, from what I've gathered.*/
@8 = ~NP: Well, have a good day. Come back anytime, this store is open day and night. And don't forget to visit my friend the gnome over there in the corner. He's a very good blacksmith. As for weapons and armor, if what you need isn't available from me, he might be able to make it.~ /*But if my wares don't interest you, talk to my dwarven friend over there in the corner. He's quite the accomplished smith. When it comes to arms and armor, if I don't sell it there's a good chance he can make it.*/
@9 = ~Maybe you'll find her more helpful than I did.~
@10 = ~What do you mean?~
@11 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@12 = ~Is there anything else I can do for you?~
@13 = ~NP: When I heard that an archaeologist had shown up here, I went to talk to her about an item I've been looking for for a long time. But she wasn't interested. She said that she only wanted items of historical significance and that she didn't have time to scrounge around for trinkets. I even offered her a generous reward, but she seemed more interested in the bottle of wine on the table.~ /*But she wasn't really interested. Said she only wanted items of historical significance and that she didn't have time to chase after trinkets.*/
@14 = ~Maybe I could help you.~
@15 = ~Don't know if there's much I can tell you as I'm kind of new here myself. Just came up from the southern Sword Coast to oversee the opening of the newest branch of my operations.~
@16 = ~Maybe you could at that. You seem like a capable <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Tell you what, you help me out and I'll give you the payment I was offering Lillian.~
@17 = ~What kind of job?~
@18 = ~What's it pay?~
@19 = ~This does not interest me.~
@20 = ~NP: In addition to being a trader, I also collect rare gemstones. Right now, I'm very interested in a stone called the Star Glowing Sapphire. It's very valuable, I guarantee you that, but you won't sell it for more than 2000 gold. I'm a collector and I'm interested in it, that's why I'm offering you 4000 gold if you find me this stone.~ /*The Star Sapphire is valuable, that I'll warrant you; but you'll never get more than 1000 gold from any other dealer. But it's interesting to me as a collector, so I'm offering more: I'll give you 3000 gold if you bring it back to me.*/
@21 = ~NP: I have this Sapphire with me.~ /*I have the Star Sapphire right here.*/
@22 = ~Why do you want it?~
@23 = ~I'll give you 3000 gold pieces, the same as I offered Lillian.~
@24 = ~Fair enough. If you change your mind let me know. Is there anything else I can do for you?~
@25 = ~Well done, my good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. And, as promised, here is your reward. 3000 gold pieces was the price agreed upon, I believe.~
@26 = ~Thank you, Husher.~
@27 = ~NP: I had to go through a lot of trouble to get you this gem, Hasher.~ /*I went through a lot of trouble to get this gem for you, Husher. A *lot* of trouble.*/
@28 = ~Dig a little deeper, Clay, or I'll rip out your guts and strangle you with your own intestines!~
@29 = ~NP: This Sapphire was part of the dowry of Lianne Sheru, the youngest daughter of an influential merchant, his family was very famous in Waterdeep some two centuries ago. But Lianne was not ready for marriage. She really wanted to become a mage and on the morning of her wedding she fled north in search of fame and fortune.~ /*The Star Sapphire was part of a dowry given to Layenne Cheroux, the youngest daughter of a powerful merchant family that flourished in Waterdeep nearly two centuries ago.*/
@30 = ~NP: You're welcome, you're welcome, <SIRMAAM>.~ /*What was it you wanted, then, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/

@32 = ~NP: Okay, I guess it really wasn't that easy. I can only imagine how hard it was to avoid all the traps in Lianne's tomb. So here's another 400 gold pieces. I already paid you more than this stone is worth, but I guess that's the fate of all collectors.~ /*Well, I imagine this was quite difficult to acquire. I imagine surviving the tricks and traps of Layenne's tomb was no easy task.*/
@33 = ~I'm sorry but I've already given you far more than the gem is worth, and we did have a deal. I'm not about to start renegotiating now.~
@34 = ~Okay.~
@35 = ~NP: Okay, why don't you, uh. calm down. I can see you're very upset about this, but I think we can avoid violence. You don't have to take it so personally. Here, take another 400 gold pieces. I hope it's enough to defuse the situation. Now let's forget about our friction, what's happened is happened.~ /*Now just... just settle down. You obviously feel quite strongly about this, but there's no need to get violent. Don't get all worked up.*/
@36 = ~According to the reports, Layenne became quite an accomplished wizard. She was powerful enough to foresee her own death and construct an elaborate, trap-filled tomb to inter her remains.~
@37 = ~And you think the Star Sapphire is still in her tomb?~
@38 = ~NP: Apparently, the Star Sapphire was one of her most valuable treasures. It reminded her of the life she had given up in Waterdeep. The Star Sapphire would make a fine addition to my collection. Bring it to me and I will pay you 4,000 gold, which is exactly what I offered Lillian. That's a lot more than I could get for this stone from an ordinary merchant.~ /*The Star Sapphire would make a nice addition to my collection. Bring it to me and I'll give you 3000 gold pieces, the same price I offered Lillian. It's far more than the sapphire is worth to a more typical buyer.*/
@39 = ~Okay, I'll do it.~
@40 = ~NP: That's great. No one knows exactly where Lianne is buried, but rumor has it that it's somewhere in the Forest of Sturge. If someone has managed to discover where that tomb is, that someone hasn't come back and reported it. But that shouldn't scare you. I think you'll do just fine. Just bring me the Star Sapphire when you find it, and I'll give you your reward.~ /*If anyone's ever found the exact location of her tomb, they never came back alive to report it. But don't let that scare you off. I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle.*/

@42 = ~Hello again. Any luck in locating the Star Sapphire? Or did you come just to check out my wares? Nobody has more in stock than Husher Clay, I'm fond of saying.~
@43 = ~Tell me about the Star Sapphire again.~
@44 = ~I'll be going now.~
@45 = ~NP: He was buried with the mage Lienne, in her tomb, somewhere in the area of the Forest of Sturge. Bring it to me, and I'll pay you 4,000 gold as we agreed. So, do you need anything else?~ /*It was buried with the mage Layenne, in her tomb somewhere out in the Coldwood. Bring it back to me and I'll give you 3000 gold pieces, just like we agreed on earlier.*/
@46 = ~NP: Alas, I'm afraid I don't have that in stock. Ha-ha! But seriously, I really don't know anything about it. Maybe you should talk to Lillian Cambridge, that archaeologist Aaryn Gend brought in. From what I've heard, she spends most of her time in the tavern. Is there anything else I can do for you?~ /*You might want to speak with Lillian Cambridge, that archeological expert Aarin Gend brought in. She spends most of her time at the tavern, from what I've gathered.*/
