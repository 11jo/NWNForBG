@0 = ~I don't like this. I don't like this one bit. When I became an archeologist, this was not what I had in mind! Master Ford is messing with things he doesn't understand. Things like that Source Stone are best left to wizards, not professors and their students!~ /*Master Ford is messing with things he doesn't understand.

@1 = ~I need to see the Source Stone.~
@2 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~You'll have to see Master Ford about that. I don't know why anyone would want to see that thing, though. There's something evil about that stone - I can feel it!~
@5 = ~Go ahead and ask your questions. I'll tell you whatever I know.~
@6 = ~Who are you?~
@7 = ~Who is Master Ford and where can I find him?~
@8 = ~What do you know about the Source Stone?~
@9 = ~Where are the Words of Power?~
@10 = ~You should go speak to Master Ford. Maybe you can talk some sense into him and get him to give this all up.~
@11 = ~I am Esmerelda, one of Master Ford's students. He has me concocting philters of crushed gems, as if he hopes that will give him some insight into the Source Stone. But this stone isn't like normal gems. We have no idea what we're getting into here, and I don't like this one bit.~ /*I am Esmerelda, one of Master Ford's students. He has me concocting philters of crushed gems, as if he hopes that will give him some insight into the Source Stone.*/
@12 = ~Master Ford is only the most famous archeologist in all of Neverwinter! He's spent the better part of fifty years unearthing items of great historical significance! But he's never unearthed anything like this before. I'm honored he chose me to help him uncover the secrets of the Source Stone! That's him, over there by the door.~ /*But he's never unearthed anything like this before. I'm honored he chose me to help him uncover the secrets of the Source Stone! That's him, over there by the door.*/
@13 = ~The stone contains immense power and radiates a widespread but gentle warmth throughout the whole city. That's the reason it's never winter in Neverwinter. Other than this we *know* very little. But Master Ford has several interesting theories. You should speak to him about them.~ /*The stone contains immense power and radiates a widespread but gentle warmth throughout the whole city. That's the reason it's never winter in Neverwinter.*/
@14 = ~They're with the Source Stone, of course. Master Ford feels their power is the key to unlocking the secrets within. Perhaps you should speak to him about this.~
