@0 = ~Please! You... you don't look like them soldiers... you won't hurt me, will you?~
@1 = ~I am an adventurer looking for information; I don't mean any harm.~
@2 = ~Get out of my way! I'll take whatever I want!~
@3 = ~I was just leaving.~
@4 = ~NP: I... I think you're not a bad person. You just scared me so much! Besides, there's soldiers all over the place. So, what do you want from me? Why are you here?~ /*I... suppose you don't seem the bad sort. You just startled me so! With all the soldiers rampaging around, I assumed...*/
@5 = ~Why are you so frightened? I said I wouldn't hurt you.~
@6 = ~What's going on in this city?~
@7 = ~Goodbye.~
@8 = ~I don't believe you! You're just like the other soldiers, you are!! Here to rob me or kill me!!~
@9 = ~Aahhh! Robber!! Get away, get away!!~
@10 = ~Thank Ilmater! Just go, go!!~
@11 = ~NP: I... I don't know. It's just for weeks now there's been armed soldiers roaming the streets. They take whatever they want. If they think you can fight, they force you to join the army of one of the High Captains-- Otherwise, they'll just kill you. And... God forbid they think you're working for another of the High Captains--~ /*They take whatever they like. If they think you can fight, they force you to join one of the High Captains' armies... or they kill you.*/
@12 = ~Tell me about these High Captains.~
@13 = ~Is there nobody to stop all this?~
@14 = ~NP: N-no one knows for sure. A few weeks ago, the High Captains just started, uh. trying to kill each other. They each have their own army, and they're fighting in the streets day and night. Burning down houses, killing people. It's all falling apart! It's even worse now that so many people are dead... There are monsters in the streets. Big rats and walking corpses. They say the High Captains are taking them into the army.~ /*Worse, now that so many are dead... there's monsters come to the streets. Big rats and walking dead. Some says the High Captains use them for their armies, too.*/
@15 = ~Be careful on those streets. They'll kill you if you're spotted.~
@16 = ~NP: I don't, uh. don't know much about them. There were five of them, and they were all sort of pirate captains. Everyone says they've gone crazy. Maybe each one of them wants to take over the city? I don't know... but they're killing everyone and they don't care what happens to us.~ /*Maybe each of them wants to control the city? I don't know... but they're killing everyone and they don't care what happens to any of us.*/
@17 = ~N-no... who? Maybe the wizards? I don't know.~
@18 = ~What wizards?~
@19 = ~NP: The wizards are from this Brotherhood of the Sacraments. They live in a large tower on an island near the mouth of the river. I don't know anything else about them, I swear! It's just. they're just supposed to be very powerful, that's all.~ /*I don't know any more abouts them, I swear! They... they're just supposed to be real powerful, that's all.*/
@20 = ~Tell me about the High Captains.~
@21 = ~Back again? Did you... need something?~
@22 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@23 = ~Questions? What do you want to know?~
@24 = ~Don't hurt me! Please don't hurt me!!~
