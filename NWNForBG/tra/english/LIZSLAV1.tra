@0 = ~Ulak sabba por! Poad hisa ul pathcea fea gal!~
@1 = ~I'm sorry, I don't understand you.~
@2 = ~What are you trying to say?~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~Jula va pekito. Rawa asagus.~
@5 = ~You cannot be here! If the Mistresses catch an escaped slave in the golem room they will kill us both!~
@6 = ~Who are you?~
@7 = ~I am no escaped slave! I am a visitor from the distant future.~
@8 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@9 = ~NP: I am one of the slaves ordered by the Masters to build golems. Once completed, the golems will become indestructible vault guards. I am forbidden under pain of painful death to speak with other slaves. That's why you shouldn't be here!~ /*I am one of the slaves the Mistresses have commanded to create golems. When finished, the golems will be indestructible guardians of the vault.*/
@10 = ~The Mistresses will not care who or what you claim to be! You are not of the Creator Race and they will destroy you if they catch you here!~
@11 = ~I will tell you what you I can, but then you must go! I cannot risk you being caught in here!~
@12 = ~What can you tell me about the Creator Race?~
@13 = ~What you build here?~
@14 = ~I am searching for one of the Words of Power.~
@15 = ~Be careful! If the Mistresses catch you, all of the slaves will be beaten as punishment... or worse!~
@16 = ~NP: I can only tell you the simplest things. The people of the Lizard firmly hold the whole world in a fist. They enslave us as inferior races, force us to serve the Reptilian Mistresses until death. They are wild and cruel, and do not care for those who serve them. Many slaves died during the construction of this complex under the whips of the Lord. I'm afraid that's all I know about the Creator Race.~ /*I can tell you only what is common knowledge. The Lizard People rule the world with a terrible scaled fist. They enslave us lesser races, forcing us to serve the reptilian Mistresses until our deaths.*/
@17 = ~The Mistresses are forcing us to build a great vault. When finished it will be protected by magical wards of smoke, light and sound, as well as the golem guardians I am working on.~
@18 = ~What can you tell me about these golem guardians?~
@19 = ~What was that you said about magical wards?~
@20 = ~NP: Do you know what will be stored in the shelter?~ /*Do you know what the vault protects?*/
@21 = ~Thank you for your help. I will be going now.~
@22 = ~I am sorry, I have not heard of such a thing. But I am only a slave, born into servitude. My knowledge is limited to what the Mistresses tell me. Is there anything else you wish to know?~
@23 = ~When complete, the vault will be protected by three indestructible guardians: golems immune to all physical and magical attacks. My task is to complete the creation of one of these golems.~
@24 = ~Is there any way I could convince you not to finish building the golem?~
@25 = ~Once complete the vault will be protected by three wards, one each of smoke, light and sound. Once activated, each of the wards can only be deactivated from a different room within the complex where the mechanisms that power the individual wards are to be located.~
@26 = ~The Mistresses have not told me what the vault will protect. Until the magical wards are crafted to guard the vault, it lies empty and unguarded. Anyone can enter, though they would risk capture by the Masters.~
@27 = ~If I do not complete the golem the Mistresses will torture me until I beg for death... and then they will grant it to me in gruesome fashion.~
@28 = ~I could free you from your enslavement.~
@29 = ~I could give you gold. Lots of it!~
@30 = ~Here is Lokar's ring. He said you would help me.~
@31 = ~I do not know the secret to deactivating the wards once they are finished, but I imagine you would have to solve the riddles of smoke, light and sound to gain entry once the wards are in place. And once my work here is complete, the golems will have to be vanquished as well.~
@32 = ~NP: Where should I go? Damned lizards rule the world! I will be doomed to live all the time on the run, knowing the terrible fate that awaits if I am caught. I am a privileged slave of high rank. I have my own corner and decent food. I'm allowed to have a companion and I rarely get hit. You can't offer anything comparable to this.~ /*I am a high ranking, privileged slave. I am given private quarters and bountiful food. I am allowed to choose a mate and I am rarely beaten. Your offer is nothing compared to that.*/
@33 = ~NP: Please, if you help me, it will be the strongest blow to the tyranny of the Creator Race.~ /*Please, if you help me it will strike a great blow against the tyranny of the Creator Race that has enslaved you.*/
@34 = ~NP: Why do I need gold? I can't have property, I can't buy anything. If the Mistresses find it from me, they will take it away and, without a doubt, flog me as a thief. I am a privileged slave of high rank. I have my own corner and decent food. I'm allowed to have a companion and I rarely get hit. You can't offer anything comparable to this.~ /*I am a high ranking, privileged slave. I am given private quarters and bountiful food. I am allowed to choose a mate and I am rarely beaten. Your offer is nothing compared to that.*/
@35 = ~NP: Well, why are you silent about it? If you were sent by Lokar, then your mission is vital for the fate of all who live in slavery to the Race of Creators! If I don't complete the golem, the Mistresses will know that I helped you. But I can make a golem with one tricky flaw they can't find. This will give one serious vulnerability to the golem.~ /*If I do not build the golem the Mistresses will know I have aided you. But it might be possible for me to construct the golem with a single subtle flaw they will not detect. This will give the golem one fatal vulnerability.*/
@36 = ~NP: There is something strange about you. You are more than just a runaway slave. Perhaps you are telling the truth. If I help you, it will be a huge risk for me, but it will be worth it if you manage to inflict such a blow on the Mistresses. If I don't complete the golem, the Mistresses will know that I helped you. But I can make a golem with one tricky flaw they can't find. This will give one serious vulnerability to the golem.~ /*There is something strange about you. You seem more than an escaped slave. Perhaps you speak the truth. If I aid you I am taking a terrible risk but it would be worth it if you could truly strike a blow against the Mistresses.*/
@37 = ~I am sorry, but the risk is too great. I will not help you and if you kill me they will simply find another slave to replace me. The golem will be built regardless. There is nothing you can say to persuade me.~
@38 = ~I can only introduce one flaw. Should I introduce more, the Mistresses will surely notice. Would you rather I make the golem vulnerable to fire, cold, blunt weapons or slashing and piercing weapons?~
@39 = ~Fire.~
@40 = ~Cold.~
@41 = ~Blunt weapons.~
@42 = ~Slashing and piercing weapons.~
@43 = ~NP: I'll do everything. However, my changes will only be in the golem that I make. There are other golems, and you should talk to the slaves that make them, otherwise the other golems will be invulnerable. Please leave before the Mistresses see you here.~ /*I shall do as you have asked. However, my change will only affect the golem I am working on. There are other golems, but you would have to speak to the slaves building them or they will be invulnerable.*/
@44 = ~Do not worry, we will make the Golem vulnerable to fire as you have asked us.~
@45 = ~NP: No, I need something else. I want the golem to become vulnerable to the cold.~ /*I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to cold instead.*/
@46 = ~NP: No, I need something else. I want the golem to be vulnerable to blunt weapons.~ /*I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons instead.*/
@47 = ~NP: No, I need something else. I want the golem to become vulnerable to cutting and piercing weapons.~ /*I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons.*/
@48 = ~NP: We will do as you say.~ /*I shall do as you have asked.*/
@49 = ~Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to cold as you have asked us.~
@50 = ~I've changed my mind. I want you to make the golem vulnerable to fire instead.~
@51 = ~Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to blunt weapons as you have asked us.~
@52 = ~Do not worry, we will make the golem vulnerable to slashing and piercing weapons as you have asked us.~
