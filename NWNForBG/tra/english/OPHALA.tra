@0 = ~Well now, welcome to the Moonstone Mask. I am Ophala, your host and purveyor of fine spirits and entertainment.~ [OPHALA51]
@1 = ~I am especially happy to see that women are visiting. As you can see, it seems that men are more inclined to seek comfort here in times of crisis.~
@2 = ~Well hello. I am <CHARNAME>. Will you answer some questions?~
@3 = ~Just answer the question.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~You'll have stiff competition for attention tonight, I fear. Many more men than women are seeking comfort here tonight, it seems.~
@6 = ~Well, you are quite the charmer, aren't you? Ask away.~
@7 = ~What is this place?~
@8 = ~Have you heard anything about the plague?~
@9 = ~Know any rumors? Seen anything strange?~
@10 = ~My staff won't respond well to that attitude, you know. If you expect any quality of service you had better work on your tone.~
@11 = ~Do come again. We're always open.~
@12 = ~NP: It is a place of peace and understanding. Everyone understands this in their own way, so we offer a variety of services. If you are here for the first time, you will not understand. Most of the things that happen here are quite... Decent. Yes... Most. Maybe you are interested in our salon? Maybe you could be helpful... No, I allow myself too much.~ /*I can't expect you to understand if this is your first visit. Most of what goes on here is quite innocent. Ah... most.*/
@13 = ~You can trust me. What've you got to say?~
@14 = ~Come now, madam. Don't keep secrets between us.~
@15 = ~Don't play games. Tell me or shut the hell up.~
@16 = ~I'm interested in the backroom.~
@17 = ~I won't have it spoken of within these walls. This is a place away from those... horrible concerns. Don't upset my customers, understand?~
@18 = ~NP: Look, you're quite attractive, why don't you ask people yourself? I don't like to gossip about my clients. There are some... who are not very handsome, but everyone is welcome here. If I didn't keep secrets, no one would come here.~ /*Look, you seem to be a likable person, so why don't you ask people yourself. It's not my business to tattle on my customers.*/
@19 = ~I suppose there's no harm in me telling you what I need. Maybe you can help, if you're good enough.~
@20 = ~No, I need someone I can trust. I'm happy to wait.~
@21 = ~You've certainly got a silver tongue. Almost good enough for my backroom. How about I tell you what I need, and you decide if you can help.~
@22 = ~There's no need for that tone! I suppose... I suppose I do need a rougher kind of person. I don't have to like it, though.~
@23 = ~NP: We have wonderful staff ready to entertain and listen to you during this difficult time. They can please both men and women. They can have a pleasant conversation, deftly cheer you up, or somehow distract you. Both parties decide how their communication will go, but for the time spent, a small compensation is due.~ /*They can cater to both men and women, and are quite skilled at conversation, artful pursuits, and many other forms of diversion.*/
@24 = ~I want permission to access the backrooms.~
@25 = ~Bunch o' harlots and jigg-o-lers! You sick!~
@26 = ~NP: You see, I'm a passionate... Collector. While working here, I hear about a lot of interesting things, and sometimes I hire people to get me these things. Now I need to &quot;borrow&quot; a few pieces of art. Their owners took the liberty of speaking badly about me, and I would like to express my dissatisfaction.~ /*Currently, I want a few pieces of art "liberated." The owners of them have made disparaging remarks about me, and I would like to express my displeasure.*/
@27 = ~Tell me about these art objects.~
@28 = ~This does not interest me.~
@29 = ~One is a statuette of someone's mother, or some such. Lord Androd Golden has it at his estate. He lobbied to ban city guards from visiting the Moonstone Mask.~
@30 = ~NP: Listen anyway, if you change your mind, you'll know where to go. Rambottom's estate in the Black Lake region. Androd's estate - in the port area. Last I heard Hodge was in the Black Lake area. No doubt he took refuge in one of the aristocratic houses, but I don't know which one. I am not asking you to kill. Just bring me the items. I will reward you well.~ /*Last I heard, Hodge may have been in the Blacklake district. No doubt he's fortified himself in some noble's home, but I don't know which.*/
@31 = ~Another is a portrait of Sir Reginald Rumbottom III. His nephew, Lord Thoms Rumbottom, has repeatedly lobbied to have us closed down. He's a bit... insecure, I think.~
@32 = ~NP: The last one is a vase stolen from me a few years ago. The person who stole it could hardly have disappeared due to the quarantine. His name is Hodge. If you agree, I will tell you everything I know about their dwellings. Remember that if I had accurate information, I wouldn't need you at all.~ /*If you agree, I'll tell you what I know about their whereabouts. Keep in mind that if I had exact information, I wouldn't need you.*/
@33 = ~I will get them. Give me more details.~

@35 = ~NP: I do not doubt that. Fine. First of all, get a letter signed by Oleff from the temple of Tyr, certifying that you are healthy. A little precaution, understand me. When you get it, come back to me and I'll give you permission... And I'll take a donation of 200 gold. Usual payment amount.~ /*I'm sure you do. Very well. First, you will need a writ from Oleff in the Temple of Tyr, certifying you are plague free. Just a precaution, you understand.*/
@36 = ~I already have a writ from him. Here.~
@37 = ~Thank you. I'll return directly.~
@38 = ~NP: I'm sorry, but haven't we settled these things with you? Now you only need to buy a pass from the bartender.~ /*Begging your pardon, but don't you already have a key to the back room? All you need now is to purchase Pass Coins from the bartender.*/
@39 = ~NP: Listen, they only sell services for gold, by mutual agreement. In addition, most visitors just want to talk. I advise you to watch your behavior if you do not want to quarrel with me. I do not tolerate false virtue.~ /*Look, there is nothing going on here but the consensual exchange of gold for service. Besides, most people just want to talk.*/
@40 = ~NP: Perfect. Rambottom's estate is located in the Black Lake area, and Androd's house is in the port area. They are both completely paranoid. Last I heard Hodge was in the Black Lake area. No doubt he took refuge in one of the aristocratic houses, but I don't know which one. I am not asking you to kill. Just bring me the items. I will reward you well.~ /*Last I heard, Hodge may have been in the Blacklake district. No doubt he's fortified himself in some noble's home, but I don't know which.*/
@41 = ~NP: Well, everything seems to be in order. Yes, I think you will. I will gladly give you my permission. It's all about the pass. Buy it and spend as much time as you want with our friendly staff. The pass can be bought from the bartender for 200 gold. Remember, you must be good. The pass only gives you time, not consent. Consent is obtained through polite persuasion.~ /*You can get the coins from the bartender for 200 gold. Remember to be on your best behavior. The coins buy you time, not consent. Only gentle persuasion grants that.*/
@42 = ~Here is the paper. Oleff will recognize it. I'll make sure there is room in the back for you. Hurry back.~
@43 = ~Just take the paper you have. Oleff will recognize it. I'll make sure there is room in the back for you. Hurry back.~
@44 = ~NP: hello again<CHARNAME> . Have you come to enjoy a pleasant company in the salon or... On business?~ [OPHALA52] /*Greetings to you again, . Have you come to sample the delights of our company in the backroom, or is this about... business?*/
@45 = ~I have an art object you might be interested in.~
@46 = ~I have a writ from Oleff declaring me plague free.~
@47 = ~This is nothing but a house of ill-repute!~
@48 = ~What business do you need done?~
@49 = ~Well, when you phrase it like that, how can I not be intrigured. I was looking for a number of things. What have you got?~
@50 = ~Describe securing the Statuette from Androd Golden.~
@51 = ~Describe securing the Portrait from Thoms Rumbottom.~
@52 = ~Describe securing the Urn from Hodge.~
@53 = ~NP: I have all three items you are looking for.~ /*I have one of the tomes you seek.*/
@54 = ~Nothing. Nevermind.~
@55 = ~Look, there is nothing going on here but the consensual exchange of gold for service. Besides, most people just want to talk.~
@56 = ~Well, my concerns are my own, but perhaps you could be useful... I don't know though.~
@57 = ~NP: Very good. I never liked his work, but it could not be allowed to remain in the wrong hands. Especially when our relationship soured. Here, I'll pay you for this. Great job. 1500 gold should be enough. You didn't get everything. Come back when you find everything you need and get your reward. When I have all three items, I will pay more.~ /*Very good. I never did like his work, but I certainly couldn't allow him to retain this piece. Especially not since things soured between us.*/
@58 = ~NP: Thank you for bringing this, but killing Androd was completely useless! I heard what a massacre you staged! I pay less for bad work. You should have restrained yourself. Get 750 gold. You didn't get everything. Come back when you find everything you need and get your reward. When I have all three items, I will pay more.~ /*There is more for you to retrieve. Return when you have it and I'll reward you. I'll give more when all three objects are in my possession, as well.*/
@59 = ~NP: Very good. I never liked his work, but it could not be allowed to remain in the wrong hands. Especially when our relationship soured. Here, I'll pay you for this. This is the last item. These items are very dear to me, and I want to give you a little more than I have already paid. Here, take 1500 gold and something else. You deserve.~ /*Very good. I never did like his work, but I certainly couldn't allow him to retain this piece. Especially not since things soured between us.*/

@61 = ~NP: Thank you. His uncle has never been of interest to me, but this picture is written on a particularly delicate document. You couldn't leave her with Thomas. Besides, after that he will leave me alone. He doesn't really care about the Moonstone Mask. I think he... Will offer me a deal. Here, I'll pay you for this. Great job. 1500 gold should be enough. You didn't get everything. Come back when you find everything you need and get your reward. When I have all three items, I will pay more.~ /*Thank you. I never cared for his uncle, but Thoms had this painted on some rather sensitive parchment. I couldn't leave it in his care.*/
@62 = ~NP: The portrait was written on top of a special, very delicate document, but there was no need to kill Thomas at all! He has never been a fighter! He probably didn't even know it was a special picture, and he certainly didn't deserve to die just for being against the Moonstone Mask. I pay less for bad work. You should have restrained yourself. Get 750 gold. You didn't get everything. Come back when you find everything you need and get your reward. When I have all three items, I will pay more.~ /*He probably didn't even know there was anything wrong with the painting, and he didn't deserve to die for simply opposing the Moonstone Mask.*/
@63 = ~NP: Thank you. His uncle has never been of interest to me, but this picture is written on a particularly delicate document. You couldn't leave her with Thomas. Besides, after that he will leave me alone. He doesn't really care about the Moonstone Mask. I think he... Will offer me a deal. Here, I'll pay you for this. This is the last item. These items are very dear to me, and I want to give you a little more than I have already paid. Here, take 1500 gold and something else. You deserve.~ /*Thank you. I never cared for his uncle, but Thoms had this painted on some rather sensitive parchment. I couldn't leave it in his care.*/
@64 = ~NP: The vase is of little value, but I enjoy hurting Hodge. If you upset any of his plans, it's only for the best. Here, I'll pay you for this. Great job. 1500 gold should be enough. You didn't get everything. Come back when you find everything you need and get your reward. When I have all three items, I will pay more.~ /*There's no real value to the urn, but I love messing with Hodge. If you happened to spoil some scheme he was working on, all the better.*/
@65 = ~NP: The vase is of little value, but I enjoy hurting Hodge. If you upset any of his plans, it's only for the best. This is the last item. These items are very dear to me, and I want to give you a little more than I have already paid. Here, take 1500 gold and something else. You deserve.~ /*There's no real value to the urn, but I love messing with Hodge. If you happened to spoil some scheme he was working on, all the better.*/
@66 = ~NP: Oh, that's great! I never liked Androd's figurine, but I couldn't let it remain in the wrong hands. The portrait of Uncle Thomas Rambottom was written on top of a special, very delicate document, it was impossible to leave it with Thomas. The vase is of little value, but I enjoy hurting Hodge. These items are very dear to me, and I want to give you a little more than I promised. Here, take 4500 gold and something else. You deserve.~ /*These sinister talismans border on the power of artifacts. Only an evil being may wear one, and even the most evil finds his dark soul being twisted and honed by the device as it turns him more and more fiendish with every passing day. Examples of these items appear in many different forms, suggesting multiple creators at different points in history. They are thankfully very rare.*/
@67 = ~NP: Oh, that's great! I never liked Androd's figurine, but I couldn't afford to leave it in the wrong hands. The portrait of Uncle Thomas Rambottom was written on top of a special, very delicate document, it was impossible to leave it with Thomas. The vase isn't particularly valuable, but I enjoy hurting Hodge. These items are very dear to me, but it was not at all necessary to kill one of their owners. I pay less for poor work. You should have restrained yourself. Here, take 2250 gold and something else.~ /*These sinister talismans border on the power of artifacts.

@68 = ~Please don't tease me so. I have ever so many empolyees that do it better than you.~
@69 = ~Greetings. Are you with ? They were the only other new person I've spent much time with lately. Is this visit for pleasure or business?~ [OPHALA53]
