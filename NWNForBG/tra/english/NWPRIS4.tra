@0 = ~Praise the Gods! When we heard you outside the door we thought you were giants coming to haul us off to the kitchens.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~We are simple farmers. The Fire Giants captured us in a raid, and now we are held prisoner until they decide to feast on our bones! Please take us with you. Our families will reward you if you save us!~
@5 = ~NP: This room is well furnished for a prison cell. I don't think giants provide such comforts for prisoners.~ /*This room is pretty fancy for a prison cell. I didn't know giants were so accommodating.*/
@6 = ~It's too dangerous to come with me.~
@7 = ~Okay, you can come with me. Just stay out of the way when the fighting starts.~
@8 = ~We don't know anything. We were thrown into this rooom by the giants when we first arrived, and haven't been allowed to leave since. Please, take us with you. Our families will reward you for saving us!~
@9 = ~No, don't leave us here. Please, take us with you. Our families will reward you for saving us!~
@10 = ~Stone walls do not a prison make, nor iron bars a cage. Despite the decor this room is still a prison. Please, free us from our captivity. Our families will reward you well for rescuing us.~
@11 = ~I don't trust you. I think I'll just leave you here.~
@12 = ~Thank you, my <LADYLORD>. We will follow behind you, and try to stay clear of the fighting while you destroy the fire giants. Your reward for rescuing us will be beyond all your expectations.~
@13 = ~You are not as foolish as we assumed, <RACE> creature, but that will not be enough to save you!~
