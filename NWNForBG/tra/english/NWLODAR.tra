@0 = ~Look, don't bother me right now. I got a lot on my mind, what with this trial and all.~
@1 = ~Trial? What trial?~
@2 = ~I know about the trial. I'm defending Rolgan.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~One of them Uthgardt killed Griff. Stabbed him right in the gut. I saw the whole thing, so now I got to testify. Neurik over at the Temple is setting the whole thing up. I don't want to be rude, but this trial has got me kind of worked up. I don't much feel like talking right now. Go talk to Neurik if you want to know more.~ 
@5 = ~Funny, you don't look like a lawyer. But that ain't my business, I guess. You want to ask me some questions, go ahead.~
@6 = ~Tell me what happened.~
@7 = ~Tell me what you know about the crime, or you might not live long enough to testify!~
@8 = ~If you need anything else I'll be right here. Until the trial is over they've got me off active duty, so I plan on spending my time here in the drinking house.~
@9 = ~Griff and that Uthgardt were playing cards. Gambling. Griff won a lot of money. So much that the Uthgardt had to give him some of his jewelry to cover the debt. Real fancy looking stuff. Later that night Griff went outside. I heard him shout, and I rushed out to see him and that Uthgardt smashing swords. Guess the Uthgardt was better at it than Griff. I can't believe I have to testify about this. I've never been to a trial before.~ 
@10 = ~Anything else?~
@11 = ~Don't get so worked up about this trial. Barkeep, a drink for my friend Lodar, please. I'm buying.~
@12 = ~So you never saw who started the fight?~
@13 = ~What kind of lawyer are you! I don't want no trouble! I told you everythin' I know! Geez, you're as bad as Griff. He was always picking fights!~
@14 = ~Maybe it was Griff who started the fight in the first place.~
@15 = ~That's all I know. I don't even understand why they need me at the trial. I wish I didn't have to go.~
@16 = ~Hey, you're all right <BROTHERSISTER>. Good luck in that trial... and thanks for the drink.~
@17 = ~No, they was already fighting when I got there. I never thought it would end up with Griff dead and me having to go to that Uthgardt's trial!~
@18 = ~Maybe. He was a real son of a bitch sometimes. And he hated the Uthgardt. Figured they were nothing but drunken savages. He was always looking for an excuse to make trouble for them. But it ain't my job to find out who's to blame, is it? That's your job. So instead of threatening me, why don't you leave me alone and go do your job?~ 
@19 = ~Hey, no hard feelings. Bartender - a drink for my friend Lodar, please. I'm buying.~
@20 = ~Hey, I remember you! You're that lawyer. Mighty kind of you to buy me that drink.~
@21 = ~How about a refill? Bartender, bring me another drink for Lodar.~
@22 = ~Anything else you can tell me about the trial?~
@23 = ~Thanks, I needed that. Too bad you're trying to get Griff's killer off... I kind of like you. You're a nice <MANWOMAN>. Not like Griff. He was always getting into trouble. Picking fights, that kind of thing. Kind of a racist, too. Always going on about the Uthgardt being drunks and thieves and such.~ 
@24 = ~Maybe Griff's to blame for the fight with that Uthgardt.~
@25 = ~Nah, I told you pretty much everything I know already. If you need anything else I'll be right here. Until the trial is over they've got me off active duty, so I plan on spending my time here in the drinking house.~ 
@26 = ~Maybe, but I shouldn't be speaking ill of the dead. Griff had some ugly secrets, but now's not the time to drag it all out.~
@27 = ~Secrets? What kind of secrets?~
@28 = ~I really shouldn't tell you. Griff was a friend, after all.~
@29 = ~If there's something I should know for the trial you should tell me.~
@30 = ~We're friends, aren't we? Have another drink on me and tell me what you know.~
@31 = ~If I don't tell you, someone else probably will. And I don't want to get in no trouble. Griff's gone now anyway, so who cares if anyone finds out, right? Griff had a nasty habit of spiking the drinks of people he was gambling against.~ 
@32 = ~I think I've had too much to drink and I don't want to say anything stupid. Forget what I said about Griff's secrets. It was nothing. Good luck with the trial.~
@33 = ~Sure, why not? Bartender, another round! Griff's gone now anyway, so who cares if anyone finds out, right? Griff had a nasty habit of spiking the drinks of people he was gambling against.~ 
@34 = ~He figured it would give him an edge over them, make their mind all hazy. Not really sporting, but that's the kind of guy Griff was.~
@35 = ~Some of the mercenaries are complaining about Neurik over at the Temple of Tyr. They're mad because that Uthgardt was found innocent of murder. I guess they aren't too happy with the verdict. But like Neurik said, the trial is done and justice was served.~ 
@36 = ~I heard the Uthgardt aren't real happy about Neurik executing Rolgan. I even heard they got the body out there on a stake over near Tyr's Temple. That's a pretty harsh sentence. But like Neurik said, the trial is done and justice was served.~ 
@37 = ~I'm here, yer honor.~
@38 = ~Well, sir, it was night and Griff was outside the barracks. All of a sudden we heard this shout, and we run out and Griff and that Uthgardt there are going at each other with weapons drawn. Before we could step in, that savage stabs Griff right in the gut and runs off. We ran to get the cleric, but by then it were too late. Griff was gone. That savage killed him!~ 
@39 = ~I'm ready for your questions, <LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>.~
@40 = ~Did you see who actually started the fight?~
@41 = ~Was the Uthgardt in his right mind, or did he seem intoxicated to you?~
@42 = ~Isn't it true that Griff spiked Rolgan's drink earlier that evening?~
@43 = ~Can you tell me how Griff felt toward the Uthgardt?~
@44 = ~I have no more questions for this witness.~
@45 = ~No, they were already going at it by the time we got there.~
@46 = ~So maybe Griff started the fight and Rolgan was just defending himself.~
@47 = ~He was pretty drunk.~
@48 = ~So drunk he didn't know what he was doing?~
@49 = ~Yeah. He wanted to mess that Uthgardt up so he could beat him at cards, you know? Make him not think straight.~
@50 = ~So Griff is partly to blame for his own death?~
@51 = ~He didn't like them much. He was always complaining about them as 'damn savages' and 'filthy Uthgardt.' Always picking fights with them, looking for trouble.~
@52 = ~So this fight could have been started by Griff?~
@53 = ~Yeah, I guess. Could be Griff started it. I don't know, I wasn't there.~
@54 = ~I guess so. Maybe. Don't know if that's a good excuse, though.~
@55 = ~Well, it was his fault the Uthgardt was doped up. Maybe if Rolgan was in his right mind he wouldn't have killed Griff.~
