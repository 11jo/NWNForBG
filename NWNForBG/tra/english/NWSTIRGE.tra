@0 = ~Ah, a worthy opponent! Greetings, I am Stirge the baby-killer, recently escaped from hard time in Waterdeep! My four fellow prisoners and I are now among the most wanted criminals along the Sword Coast.~
@1 = ~A baby killer? In that case, I'll have to kill you.~
@2 = ~Stirge? You're one of the escaped criminals with a huge bounty on his head!~
@3 = ~Why would you tell this to a stranger?~
@4 = ~Not so fast! After all, it isn't my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties posted the length of the Sword Coast, you'd know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof. If you'd spare my life and listen to what I have to say, I'd be willing to cut my ear from my head and give it to you as proof.~ /*Not so fast! After all, it isn't my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties posted the length of the Sword Coast, you'd know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof.*/
@5 = ~If that were not enough, I'd also be willing to tell you where to find some of other escaped prisoners. They are as dastardly as I, and are worth the same reward. Come now; listen to what I have to say. Surely you are interested in finding out how I, Stirge the baby killer, escaped from the most secure prison in Waterdeep.~ /*If that were not enough, I'd also be willing to tell you where to find some of other escaped prisoners. They are as dastardly as I, and are worth the same reward. Come now; listen to what I have to say.*/
@6 = ~All right, how did you get out?~
@7 = ~I'm done talking to a baby killer. Defend yourself!~
@8 = ~You are correct my friend. I am one of the only living beings to have escaped Waterdeep's most secure prison. But before you do anything rash, please hear me out.~
@9 = ~NP: Why should I listen to this, dwarf?~ /*Why should I listen, gnome?*/
@10 = ~Why shouldn't I tell you? It's important that you realize I'm not some simple farmer bumbling about a rotted out tree stump! I am Stirge the baby killer!~
@11 = ~I was just about to tell you. Glad to see that flicker of impatience in the air between your ears. I found myself in prison, rather unfortunately. I wanted to get out so I can go back to doing what I do best. I realized that escaping this Waterdhavian prison was said to be impossible, so I knew I would need help achieving the impossible.~ /*I realized that escaping this Waterdhavian prison was said to be impossible, so I knew I would need help achieving the impossible.*/
@12 = ~So you went to the other inmates?~
@13 = ~Really? How quaint!~
@14 = ~My good <PRO_GIRLBOY>, I have a reason for everything. After all, it isn't my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties closely my friend, you'd know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof. If you'd spare my life and listen to what I have to say, I'd be willing to cut my ear from my head and give it to you as proof.~ /*My good <PRO_GIRLBOY>, I have a reason for everything.

@15 = ~Yes, indeed. Aren't we a quick study? Someone woke up refreshed this day! So yes, I worked out a relationship with Zor, Delilah, Wyvern, and Yesgar. I knew they would all be interested in escaping, and unlike the others, had the talent to do so.~ /*Yes, indeed. Aren't we a quick study? Someone woke up refreshed this day! So yes, I worked out a relationship with Zor, Delilah, Wyvern, and Yesgar.*/
@16 = ~What kind of talent?~
@17 = ~The only kind of talent! The kind that works together. Zor was a big brute! He could pull down gates or smash through doors! Delilah's poisons helped us to "incapacitate" many of the guards within the prison. And Wyvern was able to call to the animals to further our escape. He used them to deliver messages, create distractions, and even to help us shake off the guards from our trail. It was very exciting!~ /*The only kind of talent! The kind that works together. Zor was a big brute! He could pull down gates or smash through doors!*/
@18 = ~NP: What was your role in the escape?~ /*What your role in escape?*/
@19 = ~Me? I helped to put it all together. Mine were the brains that put the plan together, and got us all working in unison... Well, me and Yesgar but he's just the figurehead, there to inspire loyalty.~
@20 = ~You still trying to escape. No success yet?~
@21 = ~Oh, but it has! No one ever escaped from that prison! We were the first. We made it out the door. We can get caught now, after the fact, but it doesn't change anything. We escaped.~
@22 = ~NP: So what's next?~ /*"To what end?"*/
@23 = ~Now, we play a game. You beat me at it, and I cut off my ear and give it to you, because that's all you really want, isn't it? The bounty you'll get from my ear. The game we'll play is the oldest game of all. I will give you a word and you must respond to it with another word that can defeat the original without being its opposite.~ /*The game we'll play is the oldest game of all. I will give you a word and you must respond to it with another word that can defeat the original without being its opposite.*/
@24 = ~If you win I'll tell you where Delilah is and give you my valuable ear. If not we will settle this with blades.~
@25 = ~All right, let's play.~
@26 = ~Can you give me an example of how to play?~
