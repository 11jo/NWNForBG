@0 = ~Please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... spare my life! I shall give you whatever you like...~ [RIMARD55]
@1 = ~Answer my questions, then.~
@2 = ~Give me everything of worth you have, wizard.~
@3 = ~Go on... run, and don't come back.~
@4 = ~Grovelling won't save your worthless hide! Die!~
@5 = ~What... do you wish to know?~
@6 = ~Tell me who you are.~
@7 = ~I want more information on the cult.~
@8 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@9 = ~MT: Here, take it. It's not much, but I don't have anything else. Will you let me run from the tower<LADYLORD> ? Everything you asked for has already been done...~ /*Will you allow me to flee the tower, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I have done as you have asked...*/
@10 = ~I have questions I want answered, first.~
@11 = ~MT: Thank you,<LADYLORD> ! You are very kind and merciful! I swear you'll never see me again!~ /*Thank you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! You are a kind and merciful <PRO_MANWOMAN>! I swear you shall never see me again!*/
@12 = ~No! It cannot end like this! Maugrim save me!!~
@13 = ~My name is Rimardo Domine, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Once I was... Overwizard of the East Tower. That was before Arklem was overthrown, however.~
@14 = ~And what are you doing here now, then?~
@15 = ~Who was Arklem overthrown by?~
@16 = ~Who is this Arklem?~
@17 = ~I want to know something else.~
@18 = ~MT: I have no more questions. Now you will die!~ /*I have no more questions for Vanda.*/
@19 = ~Maugrim is behind it all, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. There is some other mistress that he serves... but I know nothing of it. Maugrim kept it a secret from all but his followers, and they are fanatics.~
@20 = ~What does this cult want? Why are they doing all this?~
@21 = ~Where is Maugrim?~
@22 = ~Who are his supporters?~
@23 = ~Will you allow me to flee the tower, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? I have done as you have asked...~
@24 = ~MT: But I... I have nothing left<LADYLORD> . You have taken everything. Will you let me escape from the tower? Everything you asked for has already been done...~ /*But I... have nothing left, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. You have taken it all.*/
@25 = ~Maugrim has been... forcing me to create golems. War golems for use in his army.~
@26 = ~Tell me more about Maugrim.~
@27 = ~Why would he need an army?~
@28 = ~Maugrim and his cult, of course. Maugrim has been converting followers amongst the wizards ever since his arrival.~
@29 = ~When did Maugrim arrive?~
@30 = ~Just how did the cult manage to take over?~
@31 = ~He... he is building an army, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. The High Captains, the forces of the north, the brotherhood... he gathers them all to build a great army.~
@32 = ~MT: I... I think he's at the top of the tower<LADYLORD> .~ /*I... I understand, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>.*/
@33 = ~Maugrim performs many secret rituals... he has few confidantes. The only one he keeps with him constantly is the elf woman, Aribeth.~
@34 = ~Aribeth?~
@35 = ~MT: Maugrim believes that somewhere in the heart of Neverwinter lies a great power, and gathers troops to capture it. His mistress wants what's there... badly needed. He sent his agents all over the North in search of... in search of this power. I... I don't know exactly what this power is...~ /*Maugrim believes that there is some hidden power at Neverwinter's heart and he has rallied his forces to lay claim to it. His mistress needs what lies there... needs it badly.*/
@36 = ~You are lying. You know more than you're saying.~
@37 = ~Are you telling me everything you know?~
@38 = ~MT: Arklem Greet was the Hidden Archmage of the Brotherhood...until the fighting began. I think he managed to escape when he realized that things were bad. He is a powerful magician and will definitely return to teach this... usurper... something, I think. I don't know why Arklem abandoned the Brotherhood and handed it over to the cult.~ /*He is a powerful mage and will return to teach this... usurper... a thing or two, I know it. Why Arklem let the Brotherhood fall to the cult I do not know.*/
@39 = ~MT: Mawgrim came to us over a year ago, but I don't know where. He was very attractive and possessed strong magic. Arklem listened attentively to all his promises of power. Mawgrim hinted that the lady he served could bring the Brotherhood of the Mysteries great success. He did not tell us anything about his mistress, but greed in us won over common sense. We let him take our students, in the hope that he would teach them his secrets.~ /*He would tell us nothing of his mistress, but our greed overcame our better judgment. We allowed him to take our pupils under his wing to teach them his secrets.*/
@40 = ~N-no, please... ask me about something else...~
@41 = ~Tell me what you know.~
@42 = ~Fine, I want to ask you something else.~
@43 = ~I... I am, of course...~
@44 = ~Are you sure you don't want to tell me more?~
@45 = ~Fine. Then I guess I'll have to kill you.~
@46 = ~I despise people who lie to me. I would have to hurt them.~
@47 = ~MT: All of them became his devoted supporters, ready to fulfill any of his requests. Pretty soon the whole tower was full of Maugrim's supporters, it was spreading like a plague. When we finally realized what was going on, it was already too late. Arklem fled, Maugrim decided to take his place. There was... there was a long and bloody battle, but Maugrim won.~ /*When we finally discovered what was happening, it was too late. Arklem fled from our midst and Maugrim sought to take over. It... it was a long and bloody battle, but Maugrim has won.*/
@48 = ~Please... don't hurt me! Maugrim... he seeks something for his mistress! That... that's all I can tell you!~
@49 = ~You needn't fear reprisal from Maugrim. I intend to kill him.~
@50 = ~Your life is in my hands. You had best tell me all you know.~
@51 = ~Either you start talking or I start removing your fingers!~
@52 = ~I... I can tell you nothing more, I swear it!~
@53 = ~I knew it! You are lying to me! Time to die!!~
@54 = ~MT: I... I think you're right. What Maugrim so desperately seeks... what he believes to be in Neverwinter and somewhere to the north... he calls the Words of Power. No one in the Brotherhood has ever heard of these 'words,' and I have no idea what they might be. But Maugrim longs to find them for his mistress. He sent agents all over the north to find them. He... I think he already has one... and he hopes to take the rest by force or something.~ /*The Brotherhood has never heard of these 'words,' and I have no clue what they might be. Maugrim is desperate to locate them for his mistress, however.*/
@55 = ~No! Maugrim has great power... he will hunt me! There are things he can do that... that are worse than death!~
@56 = ~That... that is all I know, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Please believe me.~
@57 = ~What are you doing within the Host Tower?! This will not be tolerated!~ [RIMARD53]
