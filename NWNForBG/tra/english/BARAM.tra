@0 = ~NP: It's good that you thought to talk to me. My name is Baram, the only true High Captain of Luskan. Excuse me for talking to you with an illusion...~ [BARAM55] /*It's good that ye've decided t' speak with me. Me name be Baram, the one an' only true High Captain of Luskan. Ye'll have t' excuse me fer speaking to ye through an illusion... the way ye've cut through me men, one can't be too careful.*/
@1 = ~Ye're good, I'll grant ye that. As a matter o' fact, ye're good enough that I'd be willing t' offer ye a sweet l'il reward should ye care to take care of Kurth for me... that *other* High Captain.~
@2 = ~What kind of reward?~
@3 = ~Kurth is already dead, actually.~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions, first.~
@5 = ~Hah! I've no interest in working for you.~
@6 = ~NP: Aha! So you're still interested in working! Nice to know. So... What can I offer you for a job? 1000 gold and a few more magic items? I'll gladly give you the whole pile of gold if you rid me of that vermin Kurt and bring me his head. Well, have you stocked up?~ /*Ah-ha! So ye are interested, after all. That be good t' know. Well, now... what would make fer a fair offer? 1000 gold pieces an' some items of magical power, t' boot?*/
@7 = ~I want to get into the Host Tower, as well.~
@8 = ~What about Londa's children? Do you have them?~
@9 = ~Kurth made me the same offer, actually.~
@10 = ~Perhaps. I want more gold, however.~
@11 = ~I'm interested.~
@12 = ~What?! By Mask's damnable arse, that musclebound pig has to die! Bah! So why did ye speak t' me? What do ye plan t' do?~
@13 = ~I was hoping you could make me a better offer.~
@14 = ~NP: The very possibility fills me with joy. Forgive me if I'm a little distrustful. Yes, I have heard the news about Kurt's death more than once. So... I'll believe it, if only you have his head. I will accept this proof. In the whole world there is only one such mug.~ /*The very possibility fills me with glee, I must admit. Ye'll have t' pardon me if I'm a wee bit skeptical on that, though. News o' Kurth's death has preceded him more 'n once.*/
@15 = ~Yes, I have his head here.~
@16 = ~Uhhh... no, me not haves head.~
@17 = ~I dinna like questions. Especially when they comes from people who dinna work fer me. I made ye an offer... do ye want it or nay?~
@18 = ~NP: Ay, what a pity! Well, if you change your mind, come and talk, huh? Until it occurs to you to go further into my base, I advise you not to do this. If you go through this door, I will decide that you have bad ideas in your head ... And I will address accordingly.~ /*And before ye get it in yer head to come any further into me base, I'd advise ye not to. If ye comes through this door, I'll be thinkin' yer out to no good... an' treat ye as such.*/
@19 = ~NP: I wonder what you might need in this damned place. Do you think wizards would want to know that? He-he-he... Don't worry, buddy, I don't need them to knock on you. Just in case they don't like your interest, I don't think I'll give you my own pass. Why don't you take Kurt's pass? He has it... And without a head, he won't need it.~ /*Just in case they don't like whatever yer interest is, however, I don't think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don't ye take Kurth's, then, instead? He has one... an' without his head, he'll not need it.*/
@20 = ~Eh? Who are ye... ahhhh, the brats from the Whitesnow manor, aye? Yes... I has them. Why do ye ask?~
@21 = ~I want them released.~
@22 = ~I just wanted to know that, that's all.~
@23 = ~Aye, I figured you'd be askin'. All right, then, <PRO_GIRLBOY>... 1250 gold pieces fer Kurth's head. How about that?~
@24 = ~No, thanks.~
@25 = ~NP: Yes, it sounds great, just great! I can't wait until I can spit on that scoundrel's head. So... Do you want to go on a case right now, or do you have any other business for me?~ /*Aye, now, that sounds just grand, it does! I'll be looking forward t' spitting on that thug's head, I will.*/
@26 = ~I have some questions.~
@27 = ~I've changed my mind.~
@28 = ~I'll go now.~
@29 = ~NP: Oooooh, wow! Okay, you've got me hooked. How much is this pig paying you?~ /*Ooooh, this be good! All right, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, ye've got me interest piqued. What is the pig paying ye?*/
@30 = ~1000 gold pieces.~
@31 = ~1500 gold pieces.~
@32 = ~2000 gold pieces.~
@33 = ~You forgets it. Me not interested.~
@34 = ~NP: Pfff! No, I don't play *those* games! Get the hell out of here, mate, if you've got any brains left. Just go through that door to my base and you'll be sorry... no question.~ /*Run along, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, if ye has a brain in yer head. Come through this door an' into me base an' ye'll be sorry... that much ye can be sure of.*/
@35 = ~NP: Wow! Let's see! Ha ha ha! Yes, you canâ€™t confuse such a vile face with anything! You won't brag anymore, freak! Which one of us is still alive? Ha ha ha! Great job mate, better than I expected. Here... Hold the gold and items. The job is done, so you can go.~ /*Ha ha ha! Aye, that be his ugly mug, without a doubt! So much fer yer stinkin' boasts, ye big oaf! Who be the last man standin' now, eh? Ha ha ha!*/
@36 = ~What about Londa's children?~
@37 = ~I want Londa's children released, as well.~
@38 = ~That's it? We're done?~
@39 = ~NP: Fine. Now we can kill you.~ /*Good. Time to kill you, now.*/
@40 = ~Pfft. Well, why not? Ye think I were just going t' take yer word for it an' shower ye with gold?~
@41 = ~Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I'll release 'em to ye once ye bring me Kurth's head. If ye're interested in me offer, that is...~
@42 = ~Why would ye even care? Bah. What about me original offer, then... Kurth's head in exchange for yer reward, aye?~
@43 = ~NP: More gold? Do you think you can do this task? I think that 1000 gold will be enough for you. So what do you agree?~ /*More gold? Can you even perform the task, you think? Kurth is no easy target, after all. No, I think the 1000 gold pieces shall be fine. Are you interested or no?*/
@44 = ~NP: I wonder what you could need in this damned place. Do you think wizards would want to know that? Hehehe... Don't worry, I don't need them to knock on you. Just in case they don't like your interest, I don't think I'll give you my own pass. Why don't you take Kurt's pass? He has it... And without a head, he won't need it.~ /*Just in case they don't like whatever yer interest is, however, I don't think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don't ye take Kurth's, then, instead?

If ye comes through this door, I'll be thinkin' yer out to no good... an' treat ye as such.*/
@46 = ~NP: And why did you need to go there? I think it's none of my business... If you're looking for death, I won't interfere. In case they don't like your interest, I don't think I'll give you my own pass. Why don't you take Kurt's pass? He has it... And without a head, he won't need it.~ /*Just in case they don't like whatever yer interest is, however, I don't think I can provide me own pass to ye. Why don't ye take Kurth's, then, instead? He has one... an' without his head, he'll not need it.*/
@47 = ~Aye? Well... I be not so fond o' questions, but ye can ask.~
@48 = ~What do you hope to get out of all this?~
@49 = ~Do you know what's going on in the Host Tower?~
@50 = ~Where do I find Kurth?~
@51 = ~What do you know about Kurth's defenses?~
@52 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@53 = ~I just wanted to know, that's all.~
@54 = ~NP: Oh! You always want to play tricky, don't you? Don't think I didn't notice. Then do what you want. But remember: as soon as you step over the threshold of this door, you will die, and you will not have time to gasp!~ /*Do as ye like, then. Know this, however: ye take one step past this door an' ye'll be dead before ye know it.*/
@55 = ~NP: Yes! Ha ha! Bring me that pig's head! I can't wait until I can laugh at her to my heart's content, haha! I'm warning you, don't talk about our deal, okay? I don't want Kurt to find out about this. And my people upstairs won't know you're working for me... Though they haven't kept you very long so far. And I'll tell you what: if you decide to sneak further into my base, I will think that you are deceiving me and take action, okay? I am watching you...~ /*Just so yer awares, I'm not breathin' a word of our little deal here, aye? I don't want Kurth to hear none of it. So my men up top won't know yer workin' for me... not that they seem to have stopped ye much 'fore now.*/
@56 = ~NP: Luskan: High Captains The city of Luskan rises and falls in the wake of the strife of its High Captains. Recently, the differences between them have turned into an endless war for power, and nothing can stop the two surviving rivals, Kurt and Baram. High Captain Baram has placed a large bounty on the slaying of the last, most ruthless foe.~ /*The city of Luskan rises and falls on the quarrels of its High Captains. Lately, those quarrels have become an all-out war for supremacy and the two remaining contenders, Kurth and Baram, have pulled out all the stops. Very recently, High Captain Baram posted a substantial reward for the assassination of his final and most ruthless rival, a move that has increased the stakes in their game of cat and mouse substantially.*/
@57 = ~Heh heh... that be it, aye? I can do far better for ye. 1500 gold pieces... plus a few magic items thrown in. If ye bring me Kurth's head on a platter. How does 'at strike ye?~
@58 = ~Aye? Heh heh... he be more desperate then I thought. All right, then, <PRO_GIRLBOY>... 2000 gold pieces an' some magic items thrown in, all fer Kurth's head. How does 'at strike ye?~
@59 = ~Heh heh... ye take me fer a fool, do ye? I'll give ye yer 1500 gold pieces, sure enough, an' some magic items thrown in... if ye gets me Kurth's head. How does 'at strike ye?~
@60 = ~NP: Wow, are you kidding? Do you think you're smarter than everyone here? Get out of here if you still have brains. Just go through that door to my base and you'll be sorry... no question.~ /*Run along, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, if ye has a brain in yer head. Come through this door an' into me base an' ye'll be sorry... that much ye can be sure of.*/
@61 = ~NP: Oh, so you're serious, right? Do you want to know what happened to the little brats? I turned the older ones into wererats... Just like myself. And the younger ones? We ate them! Ha ha ha! Such a delicious snack! Anyway, now they're all dead, ha ha ha! So give them to your mother, yes! Now we don't have anything to do with you. Get out.~ /*I turned the bigger ones into wererats... just like me. An' the smaller ones? We ate them! Ha ha ha! What feisty little morsels 'ey made! Either way, they all be dead now, ha ha ha! Ye can tell their mother that, aye!*/
@62 = ~Fine. But this isn't over.~
@63 = ~NP: I killed one High Captain... I can easily kill another.~ /*I killed one High Captain, Baram... I can just as easily kill another.*/
@64 = ~That's horrible! You'll never get away with this!~
@65 = ~NP: Heh... That wasn't part of our deal! And even if it did, I can't help it, hehehe. I turned the older ones into wererats... Just like myself. And the younger ones? We ate them! Ha ha ha! Such a delicious snack! Anyway, now they're all dead, ha ha ha! So give them to your mother, yes! Now we don't have anything to do with you. Get out.~ /*I turned the bigger ones into wererats... just like me. An' the smaller ones? We ate them! Ha ha ha! What feisty little morsels 'ey made! Either way, they all be dead now, ha ha ha! Ye can tell their mother that, aye!*/
@66 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~
@67 = ~Ye think so, do ye? I've outlasted all o' the other High Captains... what makes ye think I be frightened o' you? Be smart an' run along, now.~
@68 = ~The deal were ye brings back th' bloody head to me... so run back t' wherever ye left him and give it a good cut already, aye?~
@69 = ~NP: So, *if* Kurt is dead, I think you'll quickly pull back and bring me his head, huh? After all, I can reimburse you for everything. Come on, I'm giving a reward in case this pig suddenly dies.~ /*I can make it worth yer while, after all. Let me offer ye a reward fer it, just in case the o'er-muscled pig actually be dead.*/
@70 = ~No Thanks~
@71 = ~NP: Yes! Ha ha! Bring me that pig's head! I can't wait until I can laugh at her to my heart's content, ha ha! I'm warning you, don't talk about our deal, okay? I don't want Kurt to find out about this. And my people upstairs won't know you're working for me... Though they haven't kept you very long so far.

So my men up top won't know yer workin' for me... not that they seem to have stopped ye much 'fore now.*/
@72 = ~NP: Why do you need to know that? Ha! This is not a trifle for you. I contracted lycanthropy, which is why I'm still alive, and this will help me get the reward we're all after! The only High Captain left alive will become the military leader of Luskan! And it will be me... Do not hesitate.~ /*Why do ye need t' know? Hah! It be no small matter, ye know. I infected myself with lycanthropy so I could get this far, so I could get the prize we've all been seeking!*/
@73 = ~Why would Luskan need a war leader?~
@74 = ~NP: Yes a little. Those damned wizards were killing each other, just like we were in the city. I think in the end they finished... But I'm not sure, everything can start again. Now they have chosen a new Arcane Archmage. His name is Maugrim. To me, he's so creepy. All he thinks about is Neverwinter and how much he wants to destroy it. I do not know why.~ /*They got themselves a new Archmage Arcane, fer the moment. Maugrim be his name. Bloody cheerless fellow, if ye ask me. All 'e thinks about is Neverwinter an' how he wants t' destroy it. Don't know why.*/
@75 = ~NP: That damned pig escaped and locked himself in West Harbor with all his people... Everyone knows that. He is a pathetic coward. But there is an entrance, right in the wall to the west. In any case, his people are in and out of there. This is a dangerous path and well guarded.~ /*There be an entrance, however, in the wall right next to 'is old tower. That's where his men come an' go from, anyhow. A dangerous path, though, an' well-guarded.*/
@76 = ~NP: Pfe. Kurt only relies on strength. His &quot;Bloody Hands&quot; are just stupid blockheads, that's all he hopes for. I was told that he was crazy and made an alliance with these priestesses of Oril, the cruel ice goddess. It doesn't look like him at all... He must have no way out. Hehehehe, the better for me. I don't know where he keeps his men or how many he has. You'll find out somehow.~ /*I hear he's gone an' allied himself with them priestesses of Auril, the cruel ice goddess. Not like 'im at all... he must be getting desperate. Heh heh, all the better, methinks.*/
@77 = ~Aye, suit yerself.~
@78 = ~NP: I want Londa's children to be released.~ /*I want Londa's children released, as well.*/
@79 = ~Hmmm... aye, aye I can do that. If ye really care about them brats, I'll release 'em to ye once ye bring me Kurth's head, no sooner.~
@80 = ~Why would ye even care? I certainly don't.~
@81 = ~It be over an' then some. Take one step into me base, an' ye'll be mighty sorry fer it, I assure ye. Now run along... I have plans t' make.~
@82 = ~Aye, ye think so? Kurth didn't know ye were comin'... I do. An' I ain't no musclebound oaf, neither. Now run along, if ye've a brain in that head o' yers.~
@83 = ~NP: I've already dealt with this. Where do you think all my rats come from? I didnâ€™t have enough people for this, believe me. Now run and do what you usually do when you're not killing freaks... If you're out of your mind, of course.~ /*I've already gotten away with it. Where do ye think most o' my rats came from? I never had that many men, I assure ye.*/
@84 = ~We are very done. Now that I am the last High Captain, I have plenty of business to attend to. You have done well... now off you go.~

@87 = ~Heh heh... that be for me t' know, an' for everyone else t' find out. When it's time.~
@88 = ~NP: No finished. Get in my base and you'll regret it, I assure you. Now get off... I have my own plans.~ /*It be over an' then some. Take one step into me base, an' ye'll be mighty sorry fer it, I assure ye. Now run along... I have plans t' make.*/
@89 = ~So ye've come back, have ye? Changed yer mind about me offer?~ [BARAM54]
@90 = ~I have a feelin' that it be my lucky day. How about it? Have ye good news?~ [BARAM53]
@91 = ~I do. Kurth is dead.~
@92 = ~NP: Yes, I thought so. You always want to play tricky, don't you? Don't think I didn't notice. Then do what you want. But remember: as soon as you step over the threshold of this door, you will die, and you will not have time to gasp!~ /*Do as ye like, then.

And I'll tell you what: if you decide to sneak further into my base, I will think that you are deceiving me and take action, okay? I am watching you...~ /*But let me tell ye this: if ye tries t' come into me base any further, I'll consider it a double-cross an' treat ye as such, aye? I'll be watching ye...*/
@94 = ~NP: Kurt is dead.~ /*I do. Kurth is dead.*/
@95 = ~There be nothin' fer us t' discuss! Take one step into me base an' ye'll be more'n a little sorry, I assure ye.~ [BARAM51]
