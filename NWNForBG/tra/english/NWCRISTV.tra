@0 = ~Hmm? Leave me be, I got nothing to say. Can't be seen with the likes of you.~ [NWCRIS51]
@1 = ~I just need some information about the auction.~
@2 = ~Aribeth and Lord Nasher compel me to investigate here.~
@3 = ~NP: Then I will, sorry to bother you.~ /*Fine, sorry to bother you.*/
@4 = ~I said I can't be seen speaking with you. Get lost.~
@5 = ~That was quite the display with Jalek. He's a bit off, even for a Bloodsailor, but he's a good man. Smarter than he seems, too. You've gained his confidence, though, and that means I can risk talking to you, but keep your questions quiet, all right? Vengaul's absence has everyone on edge.~ [NWCRIS53] /*You've gained his confidence, though, and that means I can risk talking to you, but keep your questions quiet, all right? Vengaul's absence has everyone on edge.*/
@6 = ~I have questions about you.~
@7 = ~I have questions about this place.~
@8 = ~I need to ask about the Bloodsailors and Vengaul.~
@9 = ~It's time for me to leave.~
@10 = ~NP: I trust you. True, I will not answer most of the questions, but you can still ask them.~ /*I'm sure you do. I won't be able to answer most of them, but you may ask.*/
@11 = ~Who are you? Why are you here?~
@12 = ~Why are you nervous about who you speak to?~
@13 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@14 = ~Ask what you will, though you have probably already figured out most of what I might say.~
@15 = ~Is the Seedy Tavern well guarded?~
@16 = ~Why are so many people here?~
@17 = ~My mission within the Bloodsailors is not focused on what you seek, but I will try to answer.~
@18 = ~If Vengaul is their leader, where is he?~
@19 = ~Do the Bloodsailors approve of this public auction?~
@20 = ~Very well, but take this key to get downstairs. It is the only copy I have. You'll still have to get by the Chef, though.~
@21 = ~Reasonable questions, if we keep our answers hushed. I am Christov, and I am here for the same reason you are: investigating the Bloodsailors. In truth, I'm not from Neverwinter, and the group I represent is hoping to locate some old allies of the Bloodsailors. Longterm goals. Your concerns are more immediate, and I will attempt to not get in your way, if you do the same for me.~ /*In truth, I'm not from Neverwinter, and the group I represent is hoping to locate some old allies of the Bloodsailors. Longterm goals.*/
@22 = ~Jalek has been assigned to be my watchman, meaning he watches me and everything I do. It is part of the initiation into the Bloodsailors. If I struck up a conversation with someone he didn't recognize, he would have to determine how I knew the other person. He would not ask gently. I worry for others, mostly. I know you don't want any undue attention. I certainly don't.~ /*If I struck up a conversation with someone he didn't recognize, he would have to determine how I knew the other person. He would not ask gently.*/
@23 = ~Ask what you will, but do not speak too loudly.~
@24 = ~Well enough. I think you will be fine in the main area here, but if you go downstairs Bloodsailor guards will attack on sight. Nobody is allowed downstairs now. There is much going on. Perhaps we should speak more of this.~ /*Well enough. I think you will be fine in the main area here, but if you go downstairs Bloodsailor guards will attack on sight.*/
@25 = ~Most of the people here came for the auction that was supposed to happen. Vengaul apparently spread rumors that he had part of a plague cure. Looks like it's been cancelled, and I think I know why. You'll have to get downstairs to find out more. It's Bloodsailor business.~ /*Most of the people here came for the auction that was supposed to happen. Vengaul apparently spread rumors that he had part of a plague cure.*/
@26 = ~Vengaul has not arrived, and I doubt that he will. He might have meant to cause some suspense, but he rarely lets a crowd grow impatient. Vengaul is a showman. He does not like to disappoint, especially after taking such pains to make sure the auction was well-known.~ /*Vengaul is a showman. He does not like to disappoint, especially after taking such pains to make sure the auction was well-known.*/
@27 = ~You think he deliberately spread word of it?~
@28 = ~Vengaul is an old style swashbuckler. He prefers the glory of a well-constructed spectacle. A few of his men disapprove vigorously. You see, some of them feel that they could be far more effective if they stopped worrying about public opinion and such.~ /*You see, some of them feel that they could be far more effective if they stopped worrying about public opinion and such.*/
@29 = ~You are talking about a revolt.~
@30 = ~Perhaps. If the rumor was true and he really has some kind of cure, he might draw attention to it in order to increase bidding on it. That, or maybe he wanted someone very important to hear of it. He's had a long history of trying to bait Lord Nasher into action. Regardless, it appears his plans have been changed. I do not think Vengaul is fully in control of the situation any more.~ /*That, or maybe he wanted someone very important to hear of it. He's had a long history of trying to bait Lord Nasher into action.*/
@31 = ~I don't know. I have heard rumblings... His lieutenant Callik is an impatient and greedy man... I can't say much more about this. There may have been some... steps taken to try and oust the old man. You should seek your answers downstairs. I'm sorry, I can't say anymore.~ /*There may have been some... steps taken to try and oust the old man. You should seek your answers downstairs. I'm sorry, I can't say anymore.*/
@32 = ~Hello. I've said too much already, but I suppose I can risk answering a few questions if you really need the information.~ [NWCRIS52]
@33 = ~Very well. I've already given out the key I had for downstairs. If you don't have it, you'll have to find another way past the door, and deal with Chef.~
@34 = ~Looks like things are settling down. There's no reason for you to talk to me. Good job, but please leave.~ [NWCRIS50]
