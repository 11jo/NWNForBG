@0 = ~You are not one of my slaves. It is strange for me to see one who does not cower and flee in terror at my presence, tiny <PRO_RACE> being. I find your courage... intriguing.~ [DRACO152]
@1 = ~I am The Master. Visitors are a great curiosity in my world, so I will forgive your intrusion. Tell me, puny one, why have you come to my realm?~ [DRACO153]
@2 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I am searching for the Words of Power.~
@3 = ~NP: I'm from the <CHARNAME> team. I'm looking for Words of Power.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. I am searching for the Words of Power.*/
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~I'm here to kill you, wyrm!~
@6 = ~I must be on my way.~
@7 = ~NP: Your name means nothing to me, <MALEFEMALE>... I have long since removed myself from your world. But the Word of Power is something I am very familiar with. There was a time when I would have interrupted your existence just for mentioning the Word in my presence. But centuries of solitude have cooled the flame of my icy blood.~ /*There was a time when I would have snuffed out your existence for daring to even mention the Word in my presence. But centuries of solitude have cooled the passions of my icy blood.*/
@8 = ~NP: When a dragon asks you a question, it is unwise to answer it with a question of your own. But centuries of solitude have made me very different from my kin. I will honor your request, little one. Ask your questions, and I will share my age-old wisdom with you.~ /*When a dragon asks you a question it is not wise to respond with a question of your own. But my centuries of solitude have brought me a serenity uncommon to my kind.*/
@9 = ~Who are you?~
@10 = ~What is this place? How does this world exist inside a snow globe?~
@11 = ~Can you tell me anything about the dwarves and dryads?~
@12 = ~Do you know anything about a Word of Power?~
@13 = ~Can you tell me anything about this amulet?~
@14 = ~NP: You are either very brave or very foolish, <RACE>. There was a time when I would have killed you for this insult, but my temper has softened over centuries of solitude. I forgive your disrespect, <RACE>. this time. But if you continue to provoke me, a slow and painful death awaits you. Know that you are incapable of threatening me, tiny creature.~ /*I will forgive your disrespect... this time. If you push me, however, I will give you a slow and painful death. Know that you are no threat to me, tiny creature.*/
@15 = ~Enough talking, coward! Time to die!~
@16 = ~Then I give you permission to take leave of my presence, small one.~
@17 = ~I can tell you of this Word of Power if you wish, though its magic is far greater than anything your trivial intellect will be able to comprehend.~
@18 = ~Yes. Tell me about the Word of Power.~
@19 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@20 = ~NP: Long ago, I was known as Ma'fel'no'se'se'kedeh'naar in the language of the ancients. Then the sons of mankind called me the Fang of Winter. But now those names mean nothing, they are forgotten, vanished from your world, as am I. Now I am Builder, Creator, Lord. This Kingdom belongs to me, everyone here worships only me.~ /*But these names mean nothing now, they are forgotten and vanished from your world, as am I. Now I am the Builder, the Creator, the Master. This realm is mine, and within it all bow down to me.*/
@21 = ~How did you end up inside this snowglobe?~
@22 = ~I cannot even begin to explain the magics I used to create this realm to a creature so pitiful as you. Suffice to say, this realm is mine, created using the ancient magic of the Creator Race bound in the Word of Power.~
@23 = ~What was that about the Word of Power?~
@24 = ~NP: They are my creatures, my servants, my slaves. I gave them eternal life when I created this kingdom so that they could serve me forever and fulfill my every whim. But my whims are few and far between, and I have rarely resorted to their services. Centuries have passed since I last spoke to them, and now at my appearance they scream in terror and turn to flee.~ /*But my needs are few, and it is rare that I am forced to call upon the creatures for their service. It has been many centuries since I last spoke with them, and now they only cower in fear or flee in terror at my approach.*/
@25 = ~Why are they always fighting each other?~
@26 = ~NP: There was a time when I would have interrupted your existence just for mentioning the Word in my presence. But centuries of solitude have cooled the flames of my icy blood. I can tell you about the Word of Power if you wish, though its magic is far more powerful than your feeble intellect can realize.~ /*There was a time when I would have snuffed out your existence for daring to even mention the Word in my presence. But centuries of solitude have cooled the passions of my icy blood.*/
@27 = ~So be it, <PRO_RACE> fool! You have brought the wrath of Ma'fel'no'sei'kedeh'naar upon yourself!~
@28 = ~NP: The Word is an ancient magic, created by a race of Creators who ruled the North before the human race even existed. Even I had not yet sprouted from the egg when they disappeared from this world. I managed to get hold of the magic of the Word, to use it to create this reality, to give eternal life to my slaves, and to make my own body immortal.~ /*The Word is an ancient magic, fashioned by the Creator Race that ruled the North before the time of manlings. Even I was not yet hatched when they vanished from the world.*/
@29 = ~Where is the Word now?~
@30 = ~I will grant you your request, puny one. Ask your questions and I shall share my infinite wisdom with you as I see fit.~
@31 = ~NP: I am an incredibly ancient creature, even for a dragon. We worms are not immortal, as creatures with short lives like you might think. When I first felt the touch of weakness on my flesh, I vowed that I would not sit and wait for the inevitable end. I created this world for myself. It is a safe harbor where the passage of time cannot touch me.~ /*When I first felt the fingers of enfeeblement creeping through my flesh, I vowed I would not sit idly by to await my inevitable end. I created this world for myself. It is a haven where I am safe from the ravages of time.*/
@32 = ~NP: Slaves must have an enemy. If they don't have an enemy, they can rebel against their Master. I realized that once, long ago. The Dwarves and Dryads tried to throw off my power. I gave them their very existence and eternal life, and they tried to conspire to destroy me? I could have destroyed them, but they were MY servants. I can't destroy my own property.~ /*I gave them existence and eternal life, and they dared to conspire to defeat me? I could have destroyed them, but they are MY servants. I would only be destroying my own property.*/
@33 = ~NP: Instead, I changed them in a special way so that dryads and dwarves could no longer work together. Now they hate each other, and I don't have to worry. When I need one of the races to favor me, the other is gripped by an uncontrollable bloodlust. When I need another race to favor me, the spell reverses direction, and those who were sane before are seized by madness.~ /*When I have need of one race to serve me, the other is consumed by an insane bloodlust. When I have need of the other race, the spell is inverted and those who were sane are now taken by the madness.*/
@34 = ~It's wrong to enslave these creatures!~
@35 = ~I created them and they are mine to do with as I please. Without me and the magic of the Word of Power to sustain them, they would cease to exist!~
@36 = ~The magic of the Word sustains this realm and my own existence. It is never far from me. More than this I will not tell you. The Word is mine and you shall never have it.~
@37 = ~What if I just take it from you?~
@38 = ~Is there nothing I can offer in exchange for the Word?~
@39 = ~Then you would die in the attempt. Do not trifle with me on this, small one. The blood in my veins is thick with age and slow to boil, yet my anger is terrible once unleashed.~
@40 = ~NP: Give me that word, or you die!~ /*Give me the Word or die!*/
@41 = ~Can you offer immortality? The Word sustains me, it is life itself. There is nothing you can offer in trade, mortal.~
@42 = ~I have suffered you to live far too long, <PRO_RACE> fool!~
@43 = ~Once more you intrude upon my solitude, tiny creature being - and yet again I forgive your trespass, because I am a merciful Master. Tell me, for what reason have you returned?~ [DRACO154]
