@0 = ~Eh? I suppose you're here to sign up, <GIRLBOY>, are ye? I've no time for a new apprentice, however, so off ye go.~ [NWKEN056] 
@1 = ~Sign up for what?~
@2 = ~I'm not here to apprentice for anything.~
@3 = ~Bite your tongue, old man.~
@4 = ~Are you sure? I'd really like to sign up.~
@5 = ~For the bloody mercenary guild, of course. Isn't that why ye've come? Hmmm... unless ye're not here for training.~
@6 = ~Nay? Then what's a young wit like yerself come to the guild for? Ye on official business?~
@7 = ~Hah! Ye've got a bit o' venom, I'll grant ye that. It won't get ye into the guild any quicker, though.~
@8 = ~Aye? Young wits like yerself who want t' join the guild are a copper fer a dozen, these days... though ye does looks in good shape, there.~
@9 = ~Wait... now I've placed ye. Ye're one o' the folk who came with the Lady Aribeth, aren't ye? From Neverwinter? My apologies, <GIRLBOY>. We get so many strangers comin' through town these days, after all. Something I can do for ye?~ 
@10 = ~Who are you?~
@11 = ~What kind of guild is this?~
@12 = ~I have one of the ears.~
@13 = ~I'd like to ask some questions.~
@14 = ~I need some directions.~
@15 = ~I will leave.~
@16 = ~Me name be Kendrack, head of the guild, here, and mayor of Port Llast. Also known as the First Captain. Yer name be, then... ?~
@17 = ~I am <CHARNAME>.~
@18 = ~Pleased to meet you. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@19 = ~My name means nothing. <CHARNAME> leads our group.~
@20 = ~You don't need to know who I am.~
@21 = ~Aye, I think I recall the Lady mentioning ye now. She said ye be a hero, in fact... which makes me doubly glad ye're here. I have a problem someone competent like yerself might be able to help with... an' there's coin in it for ye, to boot. Might ye be interested?~ 
@22 = ~What's the problem?~
@23 = ~If the reward's right.~
@24 = ~No, I'm not interested.~
@25 = ~The mysterious type, are ye? No need... I seem to recall the Lady mentioning ye. A hero, she said, an' perhaps I should be glad ye're here. I have a problem someone competent like yerself might be able to help with... an' there's coin in it for ye, to boot. Might ye be interested?~ 
@26 = ~I received word from Waterdeep not long ago that a group o' criminals escaped from the Bulwark prison. Dangerous bunch, killers all. According to the word, the group be split up to avoid capture... but all of them be in this region. That makes me nervous, it does. Each o' them has a sizeable bounty for their left ear, marked with the seal of the Bulwark, to prove that they be dead.~ 
@27 = ~'Tis too dangerous a task to set me own men to it... but perhaps ye might be up to the challenge. What does ye think, <GIRLBOY>?~
@28 = ~How much are the bounties?~
@29 = ~Just how dangerous are these men?~
@30 = ~So I would have to bring back their ear?~
@31 = ~Yes, I'll do it.~

@33 = ~There be five criminals escaped, and a bounty of 300 gold pieces exists for each of them.~
@34 = ~Not all be men, in fact... but all be quite deadly. If ye finds them, be careful. At least they be separated, now, and not all together.~
@35 = ~Aye. They be not wanted alive, any longer. The seal of the prison on their ear identifies them... and it be easier than carryin' the body.~
@36 = ~T'is a relief to hear that, <GIRLBOY>. If left free an' alive, these criminals would become a problem, I am sure. I hope ye finds them all. The five be named as follows: Zor, the Stirge, Wyvern, Delilah and Yesgar.~ 
@37 = ~Tell me about Zor.~
@38 = ~Tell me about the Stirge.~
@39 = ~Tell me about Wyvern.~
@40 = ~Tell me about Delilah.~
@41 = ~Tell me about Yesgar.~
@42 = ~That be too bad. 'Tis a bit of a worry for me that I'd like t' see resolved soon. Let me know if ye change yer mind, <GIRLBOY>.~
@43 = ~Zor be a minotaur, so he should stick out wherever he goes. He be strong and a fierce warrior... but is a wee bit simple in the head. I am told that he has many friends still in Luskan. It may be that he will be there, or at least attempting to enter the city.~ 
@44 = ~The Stirge be a strange one. A gnome thief, it is said, who believes himself t' be the smartest man alive. The gnome were sighted last in the wildlands along the South Road, though he could be anywhere there.~ 
@45 = ~The Wyvern is an elven man, a renowned bandit who is familiar with the ways of the wood. He be deceptive and cunning, and skilled with the bow. The elf has not been sighted, but I have little doubt he be hidden within the Neverwinter Wood. Best search for him there.~ 
@46 = ~A female halfling who is known to be cruel and wicked. She be an assassin who comes out of Luskan. I hear the city be closed up tight, however, so I doubt she'll be there. Last word I have of that one is that she was spotted east of town, and then all but vanished.~ 
@47 = ~Yesgar be a fierce half-orc murderer, and it were he that masterminded the escape of all of these criminals. Of all the ones that have escaped, 'tis Yesgar who has remained the most elusive. I have not a clue where he might be... though he will not stray far.~ 
@48 = ~This be the mercenary guild. Here I train fighters to hone their skills, and we see to hiring them out.~
@49 = ~Can you train me?~
@50 = ~Do you sell arms and armor, then?~
@51 = ~Let me ask you something else.~
@52 = ~In such a short time, it would benefit ye little, <GIRLBOY>. An' besides, as I already said, the guild be full.~ 
@53 = ~Nay. If ye wishes such, go an' speak to Haljal at the Cracked Anvil. He would have all ye need, I assure ye.~
@54 = ~Aye, of course.~
@55 = ~Aye? Ye found one of the convicts? Which ear do ye have there?~
@56 = ~I have Zor's ear.~ 
@57 = ~I have the Stirge's ear.~ 
@58 = ~I have Wyvern's ear.~ 
@59 = ~I have Delilah's Ear.~ 
@60 = ~Oops, me no have nothin'.~
@61 = ~Aye. 'Tis indeed the markings that the men of the Bulwark told me of. Congratulations, <GIRLBOY>, ye've done a service fer us all. So I'll be happy to offer the bounty. Come back when you find more of the bandits.~
@62 = ~Well, I hope you'll find those bastards soon.~
@63 = ~Aye, I'm sure I can tell ye what ye need to know.~
@64 = ~What have you heard about the plague in Neverwinter?~
@65 = ~Do you know of anything odd in the area?~
@66 = ~I'm looking for work, if you know of any.~
@67 = ~I have some questions about the bounties.~
@68 = ~I'm sure ye do. What do ye need t' know?~
@69 = ~Only that it be over, <GIRLBOY>. A mighty relief that news was, as well... folk were terrified that the plague would spread to town.~ 
@70 = ~Aye, we be getting reports of all kinds o' strangeness in the region. Monsters rampagin', bandits traveling about at will, that sort o' thing. It is most strange. I suppose maybe it's to be expected, though... neither Neverwinter nor Luskan has the manpower for patrols right now, aye?~ 
@71 = ~If ye're askin' about odd things in Port Llast, hmmm... maybe ye should speak to Nuirek at the temple. I hear the cleric has grave worries as o' late.~
@72 = ~I have a problem someone competent like yerself might be able to help with... an' there's coin in it for ye, to boot. Might ye be interested?~
@73 = ~I know Port Llast well. Ask away.~
@74 = ~Is there a good inn nearby?~
@75 = ~Is there a decent store in town?~
@76 = ~What temples are nearby?~
@77 = ~Is druid grove around, maybe?~
@78 = ~Me asks something else.~
@79 = ~Aye. The Alliance Arms is a fine inn, and ye'll find other adventurers like yerself there, this time o' year. Do ye need t' find something else?~ 
@80 = ~Haljal at the Cracked Anvil should have just about everything ye need, <GIRLBOY>. Do ye need t' find something else?~ 
@81 = ~The only temple in town is Tyr's, <GIRLBOY> run by Father Neurik. Do ye need t' find something else?~
@82 = ~There be one off in the Neverwinter Wood, aye. Ye may wish to speak to Ballard about it... ye'll find him at his little grove northeast of the town walls. Do ye need t' find something else?~
@83 = ~I wish ye the best o' luck on yer quest, <GIRLBOY>.~
@84 = ~Aye, <GIRLBOY>? Something I can do for ye? Has ye business with the guild?~ [NWKEN057] 
@85 = ~'Tis good to see ye again, <GIRLBOY>. Have ye had any luck tracking down the bounties?~ [NWKEN058] 
@86 = ~Thank the gods you've come! While ye were gone from Port Llast, that fiend of a half-orc, Yesgar, kidnapped my Shaldrissa! He demanded a ransom for her return, and it was paid! But still he did not return her! Please, I beg of ye... get my Shaldrissa back! She is my only child!~ [NWKEN055] 
@87 = ~Why don't you and your men get her back?~
@88 = ~Do you know where she's being held?~
@89 = ~And what might my reward be for doing that?~
@90 = ~Very well. I'll do it.~
@91 = ~No. Not interested.~
@92 = ~I... I could not endanger my daughter, and I would not trust me men to do it, if the truth be told. You, however, are a powerful <MANWOMAN> who has done so much... I would trust you. You may be her only hope!~
@93 = ~Aye, I do. The old Port Llast mines are to the north o' town, near the Green Griffon Inn. He holds her there, I am sure of it. It is a treacherous place, and easy to defend, which is why I dare not approach. I can only hope ye have the skills I don't.~ 
@94 = ~Reward? Ye can keep the ransom, if he has it. Just get her back safe, I beg ye!~
@95 = ~Go to the old mines by the Green Griffon Inn to the north of town, then. Hurry, <GIRLBOY>, hurry! Oh yeah, I almost forgot, here be rest of the bounty for the ears.~

@97 = ~I... I suppose I cannot blame ye. It is very dangerous. Here be rest of the bounty for the ears. I beg ye to change yer mind and find her. Shaldrissa is hot-headed and impetuous because she is young... she doesn't deserve this fate at the hands of a murderer.~ 
@98 = ~You've changed your mind? Please, I beg of you... bring back my Shaldrissa! She's my only child!~
@99 = ~Then go to the old mines by the Green Griffon Inn to the north of town, then. Hurry, <GIRLBOY>, hurry!~
@100 = ~What is the word? Have you found my daughter? Is she safe?!~ [NWKEN054]
@101 = ~Tell me what happened again.~
@102 = ~Where do I find her?~
@103 = ~I'm sorry, Kendrack... but Shaldrissa died. I tried my best.~
@104 = ~I'll go look for her now.~
@105 = ~Find her yourself. I have other problems.~
@106 = ~The last of those escaped convicts, that murderous half-orc Yesgar... he has kidnapped my only daughter, Shaldrissa. I already paid the ransom he demanded... but still he has not returned her. I fear for her life! Please, I beg ye to save her!~ 
@107 = ~I be sure she's held at the old mines. Ye can find them north of town, near the Green Griffon Inn.~
@108 = ~Dead? But... but how can she be... dead? Ye killed her yerself, no doubt! Bah! I cannot believe I trusted ye! My Shaldrissa... dead!!~ 

@110 = ~Please hurry!~
@111 = ~Go on, then. Leave the poor lass to die, heartless wretch!~
@112 = ~Leave me be, <GIRLBOY>. We have nothing to talk about.~ [NWKEN051] 
@113 = ~Get away from me! Some hero ye are... my Shaldrissa lies dead because of ye!~ [NWKEN052]
@114 = ~Shaldrissa is safe and returned! I cannot thank ye enough! Ye truly are the hero the Lady told me of! The girl is shaken, but otherwise she is all right. Perhaps this will serve to curb her desire for adventure, now, aye?~ [NWKEN053] 
@115 = ~Here, take the bounty for Yesgar. I wish I had more to reward ye with. If ye found the ransom, please do keep it... and as for whatever quest the Lady put ye on, I wish ye the best of luck.~ 

@117 = ~I wish ye good luck, <GIRLBOY>. Hopefully ye finds what ye're searching for.~ [NWKEN050] 
@118 = ~You killed my daughter, you scoundrels! I'll take revenge!~
