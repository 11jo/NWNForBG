@0 = ~NP: I... I don't think you're interested in doing good deeds at all, and I doubt I'd go with you again if you asked. I... don't think we'll see each other again.~ /*It just seems to me that Elves shouldn't put these things back in the ground if they didn't take them out in the first place.*/
@1 = ~It wouldn't make sense to continue this partnership if you are unhappy. Are you sure you want me to leave?~ [NWBODDNO]
@2 = ~Yes. Go.~
@3 = ~No. Stay.~
@4 = ~NP: I think the most logical thing we can do now is split up. Where can we meet if you change your mind?~ /*Then I guess the only logical thing for us to do is split up for now. But I'll remain here in case you decide you have need of me again.*/
@5 = ~NP: Go back to the sword fair.~ /*Get to the point.*/
@6 = ~NP: I'll find you at Kendrak Barracks.~ /*Port Llast - Kendrack's Barracks*/
@7 = ~NP: Wait for me here.~ /*Wait right here.*/
@8 = ~Your actions are rather illogical. You say you want me to go, then you tell me to stay. Very strange.~
@9 = ~You're back, so you must need something. The most logical assumption is that you want me to join up with you again. Correct?~ [NWBODD60]
@10 = ~Yep.~
@11 = ~No.~
@12 = ~Okay, then let's go. There's an entire world out there waiting for us to discover it.~
@13 = ~Well, if you change your mind you know where to find me... unless someone else hires me, first.~
@14 = ~Good to see you again, <CHARNAME>, though in actual fact I cannot say I am really surprised. When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be one of those recruited.~ [NWBODD53] /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be one of those recruited.*/
@15 = ~What are you doing here, Boddyknock?~
@16 = ~You again? Are you following me? I've never been stalked by a gnome before.~
@17 = ~Goodbye.~
@18 = ~NP: I was going to continue my exploration of the North. But then I heard that Aribeth was recruiting mercenaries to find the cult that was causing the plague. You can get the cure for the plague and punish those behind it<CHARNAME> , but the process by which the Howling Death spread has not yet been determined.~ /*You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.*/
@19 = ~I am *not* stalking you, <CHARNAME>! I have a vested, scientific interest in investigating the Wailing Death and the events that transpired in Neverwinter. You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.~ /*You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.*/
@20 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. If you find yourself in need of a sorcerer you know where to find me... until someone else hires my services.~
@21 = ~Given my scientific interest in this plague, and my desire to ensure it is never again unleashed upon Faerun, it was only logical that I answer Aribeth's call for aid.~
@22 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@23 = ~NP: How much will it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@24 = ~When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists. Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?~ /*When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.*/
@25 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@26 = ~I have heard people claiming the cult has a base in the plains to the south, others insist there is undeniable evidence of the cult in the forests to the east, still others swear the cult is hiding in the city of Luskan to the north. Obviously such rumors and hearsay are of little value. I prefer to put my faith in hard, empirical evidence - evidence I can observe with my own two eyes. As yet, I have found no evidence I consider reliable.~ /*Obviously such rumors and hearsay are of little value. I prefer to put my faith in hard, empirical evidence - evidence I can observe with my own two eyes. As yet, I have found no evidence I consider reliable.*/
@27 = ~But you must have an opinion of where to start looking.~
@28 = ~I don't think you understand. Without the proper data to analyze my evaluation of the situation would result in a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin of error. Naturally I have formed some preliminary theories, but if I were to venture any opinion on this matter it would be nothing more than a complete and utter guess.~ /*Naturally I have formed some preliminary theories, but if I were to venture any opinion on this matter it would be nothing more than a complete and utter guess.*/
@29 = ~So guess, Boddyknock. Sometimes you've just got to play a hunch.~
@30 = ~A... a hunch? You are a strange <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. But I suppose if I were forced to make a... shudder...guess I would say we should start our search in the Neverwinter Wood, to the south east of Port Llast. Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.~ /*Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.*/
@31 = ~Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group. The Neverwinter Wood seems to be the only place that provided the seclusion and the materials that would have been necessary for the cult to bring about the Wailing Death. At least, that's my best guess.~ /*Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group.*/
@32 = ~You seem to have some solid reasons... for a guess.~
@33 = ~So are you going to investigate the woods?~
@34 = ~I could use a sorcerer by my side, Boddyknock.~
@35 = ~As I said, I had a preliminary hypothesis. However, I would not be at all surprised to find my theory about the Neverwinter Wood to be wrong.~
@36 = ~I am an accomplished sorcerer, <CHARNAME>, but I also have a realistic understanding of my own limitations. Surviving the wilds of this region alone would be a challenge that surpasses my capabilities. Besides, Aribeth has hired us so that we may serve and assist others who are more suited for heroism and great deeds.~ /*I am an accomplished sorcerer, <CHARNAME>, but I also have a realistic understanding of my own limitations. Surviving the wilds of this region alone would be a challenge that surpasses my capabilities.*/
@37 = ~You are a well known hero, <CHARNAME>. If I were to accompany you I am certain my skills would be of some use.~
@38 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@39 = ~NP: In that case, I'll be glad to join your cause,<CHARNAME> . It's an honor to serve a hero like you. I will follow you and do my best in obedience to the order you have given.~ /*Then I will be glad to join your cause, <CHARNAME>. It is an honor to serve with a hero such as you.*/
@40 = ~Well met, <CHARNAME>. It is I, Boddyknock Glinckle from the island of Lantan. I trust you remember me from our last meeting. When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.~ [NWBODD55] /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.*/
@41 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@42 = ~NP: When Aribeth called in the mercenaries, we were all paid up front for our services - well paid. You managed to get a cure for the plague, but the process by which the Howling Death spreads has not yet been determined. I long to solve this mystery, if only such horrors can be told to the whole world. But the matter will be brought to an end only when we discover this cult.~ /*I am eager to solve that mystery, if only so such a horror can never be unleashed upon the world yet again. But that can only be accomplished if we first locate the cult.*/
