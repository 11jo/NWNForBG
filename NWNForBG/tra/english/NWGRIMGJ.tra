@0 = ~Is there something you want?~ [NWGRIM50]
@1 = ~I just want to talk for a while.~
@2 = ~Nothing, I'm all right.~
@3 = ~Conversation is one way to pass the time until the Silent Lord comes to claim us. What do you wish to speak about.~
@4 = ~If you're going to be my henchman, I'd like to know more about you.~
@5 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@6 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@7 = ~Do you have any advice or suggestions you can give me about my mission?~
@8 = ~As you wish.~
@9 = ~NP: I'm going to ask you, <CHARNAME>, to tell me more about yourself for starters. I am very curious to know what kind of <MALEFEMALE> you are, as I bind my fate to you. Why do you serve this plague-ridden city? What leads you to take your chances in the midst of streets full of bloated, disfigured corpses and burning funeral pyres?~ /*Why do you serve this plague ravaged city? What possesses you to venture out into the streets amidst the bloated, swollen corpses and the burning funeral pyres?*/
@10 = ~I have seen too much death and suffering from the plague to stand idly by.~
@11 = ~I seek to forge a legend that will last for ever.~
@12 = ~Aribeth has promised me gold and riches if I can help her in this.~
@13 = ~What the plague brings upon the people of this city cannot truly be called death; there is no final release for the victims of this illness into the waiting grasp of the Silent Lord.~
@14 = ~The name of a hero lives on long after the hero has passed from this world. But do not fool yourself, <CHARNAME>. Your legend may live forever, but you will not.~
@15 = ~Material wealth has its uses, but your gold and gems will mean nothing when the Silent Lord comes to claim you.~
@16 = ~True Death - the ultimate end of existence - is the one perfect absolute in a flawed world of uncertainty. The Order of the Long Death understands this.~
@17 = ~NP: Tell me more about the Order of the Protracted Death, Grimgnau.~ /*Tell me more about the Order of the Long Death, Grimgnaw.*/
@18 = ~That's all well and good, but just remember that until your death comes you're serving me.~
@19 = ~NP: We bring pain, torture and agony to the inhabitants of this world to prepare them for liberation by death. We sow destruction, we seek destruction, devastation and annihilation. The monks and priests of my order worship Death, <CHARNAME>. We can swear allegiance to someone else, but only as long as he or she serves the Silent Lord.~ /*The monks of my order bow down to Death, <CHARNAME>. We may swear allegiance to another, but only as it serves the will of the Silent Lord.*/
@20 = ~So the Silent Lord is the god your Order worships?~
@21 = ~NP: What an evil order you have, Grimgnau.~ /*Your Order sounds pretty evil, Grimgnaw.*/
@22 = ~NP: The monks and priests of my order worship Death, <CHARNAME>. We may swear allegiance to someone else, but only as long as he or she serves the Silent Lord. We bring pain, agony, and torture to the inhabitants of this world to prepare them for the release of Death. I have sworn to wreak havoc and destruction in the name of the Silent Lord.~ /*The monks of my order bow down to Death, <CHARNAME>. We may swear allegiance to another, but only as it serves the will of the Silent Lord.*/
@23 = ~NP: My Order does not worship any god, we worship Death itself, in all its forms. Gods are transient, for even a god can die: Baal, Bane, Sirik. But Death itself has always existed. The Silent Lord is the name we give to the concept, the very essence of Death.~ /*My Order does not bow before any god; we worship Death itself, in all its incarnations. Gods are transient - even a god may die: Bhaal, Bane, Cyric.*/
@24 = ~There are some who call what we do evil, but my Order transcends morality. Good, evil - these things mean nothing, for eventually we all bow down to the Silent Lord.~
@25 = ~NP: I think we need to go our separate ways, Grimgnau.~ /*I think we need to part ways now, Grimgnaw.*/
@26 = ~We all serve Death in one way or another, <CHARNAME>. It was only after I left Mithral Hall to join the Order that I truly came to understand this.~
@27 = ~Mithral Hall? Is that where you come from originally?~
@28 = ~How did you end up joining the Order of the Long Death?~
@29 = ~Together we can sow death and destruction throughout the North. Why would you break up our partnership and deny the Silent Lord his due?~
@30 = ~NP: You're crazy and you're evil. You're a little too evil for my taste.~ /*You're a sick and evil man, Grimgnaw. Too evil for my taste.*/
@31 = ~I just think it's time we parted ways.~
@32 = ~NP: My mind has changed. Let's go together and blaze a bloody trail full of corpses!~ /*I've changed my mind. Stick with me and we'll leave a trail of bodies across the land!*/
@33 = ~NP: I spent several years in the Hall of Mithril in the service of Bruenor the Hammer. Before joining the Order of the Lingering Death. But now there is no place for me among the clans in the Hall of Mythril; I am shunned and reviled by my own kin.~ /*I spent several years at Mithral Hall in the service of Bruenor Battlehammer. Before I joined the Order of the Long Death.*/
@34 = ~Shunned? What do you mean?~
@35 = ~We don't have time for this now. We need to stay focused on our mission.~
@36 = ~You are an agent of death, <CHARNAME>, just as I am. We both serve the Silent Lord in our own fashion, though you refuse to acknowledge what you are.~
@37 = ~We part now, but you are destined to swim in an ocean of blood. Our fates are intertwined, and I shall wait here for your inevitable return so we may once more join together to perform the will of the Silent Lord.~
@38 = ~Well spoken, <CHARNAME>. I tremble in anticipation of the carnage we shall unleash upon the Realms!~
@39 = ~This is not the time to speak of this, <CHARNAME>. Let us return to our mission - the Silent Lord's hunger will not be sated by mere words.~
@40 = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>. The hunger of the Silent Lord will not be fed by mere words.~
@41 = ~NP: That's good, <CHARNAME>. I would not like to speak of my past in the Hall of Mythril, and I thank you for changing the subject. When Bruenor the Hammer regained his throne in the Hall of Mythril twenty years ago, it ignited a strong sense of racial pride in dwarves across the North.~ /*When Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed the throne at Mithral Hall not twenty years ago it kindled a fierce racial pride in all the dwarves of the North.*/
@42 = ~NP: You are my countryman, dwarf, <CHARNAME>. Surely you would understand the desire to live in the legendary halls of our forefathers? I was one of those who gathered under the banners of Bruenor - one of many who came to fight the denizens of Underdark and tossed them out of the mines beneath Mythril Hall.~ /*I was one of many who flocked to Bruenor's banner - one of many who came to battle the denizens of the Underdark and drive them from the mines beneath Mithral Hall.*/
@43 = ~But they wouldn't accept you, would they?~
@44 = ~You said before they shunned you. What happened?~
@45 = ~Did they reject you because you were part of the Long Death Order?~
@46 = ~I was one of many who flocked to Bruenor's banner - one of many who came to battle the denizens of the Underdark and drive them from the mines beneath Mithral Hall.~
@47 = ~NP: It was long before I joined the Order of the Lingering Death, and at first the Hall of Mythril welcomed me, for even then I did not fear death, and gladly carried it to my enemies. Among Bruenor's followers, many shared my love of battle and the reckless fury with which I crushed the enemy. But none of them appreciated the terrible beauty that surrounded us in battle.~ /*There were many among Bruenor's followers who shared my love of battle and the reckless fury with which I slaughtered my foes. But none of them appreciated the terrible beauty of what was all around us.*/
@48 = ~NP: Have you never heard the majestic chorus of dying drow cries echoing off the walls of a dwarven mine? Or pause briefly in battle to appreciate the visible spectrum of deadly colors spreading across the battlefield like a colored mist? Have you not had to stand over a dying comrade, savoring his pain and fear as his life bleeds out with his blood, looking into his eyes to catch that moment of understanding that illuminates them, in that final moment when true death takes him?~ /*Have you ever stood over a dying comrade, drinking in his pain and fear as his life bleeds away, gazing into his eyes to glimpse the terrible understanding shining through in the final instant death claims him?*/
@49 = ~That's horrible!~
@50 = ~Can't say I've had the pleasure.~
@51 = ~I've seen my share of killing, if that's what you mean.~
@52 = ~NP: After the battles, I would go wandering among the scattered bodies, mesmerized... by the truth of their deaths. The others found it strange, but even though I knew it, I couldn't stop. The attraction was too strong. And as I wandered among the mangled, crushed bodies and looked at the masks of agony that froze their faces forever, I finally understood.  Drow, duergar, dwarf-- in death we are one. In death, we are all... perfect.~ /*And as I wandered amidst the twisted, mangled bodies and gazed into the masks of agony forever frozen on their faces, I understood. Drow, duergar, dwarf - in death we are all the same. In death we are all... perfect.*/
@53 = ~I tried to share my revelations with my brothers-in-arms, but they could not understand. They only looked at me with horror and disgust.~
@54 = ~NP: No kidding, you're a freak, Grimgnau!~ /*No kidding - you're a freak, Grimgnaw!*/
@55 = ~NP: They were weak, Grimgnau. They could not see death incarnate, which is you.~ /*They were weak, Grimgnaw. They couldn't dare to face death like you.*/
@56 = ~That was what they said, as well, thought they were glad to have me at their side whenever the drow attacked.~
@57 = ~NP: I left the Hall of Mythril shortly after my epiphany, searching for... something. I found the Order of the Lingering Death. I suppose I shouldn't blame my fellow Dwarves for their reaction. Accepting death is not easy. Even among the members of the Order there are those who cannot face the Silent Lord when he comes.~ /*I suppose I cannot blame my fellow dwarves for their reaction. The acceptance of Death is not easy. Even among my Order there are those who cannot face the Silent Lord when their time comes.*/
@58 = ~Go on.~
@59 = ~What do you mean?~
@60 = ~I'm sorry, <CHARNAME>, I should not have said anything about this to you. This is a matter that must be solved by those of my Order.~
@61 = ~NP: You can tell me, Grimgnau. I might be able to help you with this one.~ /*You can tell me, Grimgnaw. Maybe it's something I can help you with.*/
@62 = ~Fine - just don't let it distract you from the job at hand!~
@63 = ~You don't have to worry about that, <CHARNAME>. I'm eager to end this foul plague that is taking what rightfully belongs to the Silent Lord.~
@64 = ~I told you earlier this was a matter for those of my Order, <CHARNAME>. But you have proven yourself to be an agent of the Silent Lord - death follows you wherever you go.~
@65 = ~And even though the dwarves of Mithral Hall turned me away, I sense you will not do so.~
@66 = ~You are not one of the <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>s of the Long Death, <CHARNAME> - but you are a monk, as I am. You understand the duties and responsibilites owed to one's Order.~
@67 = ~NP: I have not been completely honest about the reasons that brought me to Neverwinter, <CHARNAME>. I came here in search of someone. Her name is Alaganda; like me, she was a novice undergoing trials to join the Order of the Lingering Death. We often trained together in anticipation of our initiation.~ /*Her name is Alaganda; like me, she was a disciple studying to enter the Order of the Long Death. We often trained together in anticipation of our initiation.*/
@68 = ~NP: I will not describe our initiation rituals to you, <CHARNAME>, but be aware that the Silent Lord takes many of those who participate in them. Only those who survive, like me, are welcomed as members of the Order of the Lingering Death. But Alaganda could not face her own mortality, and one day on the morning of her initiation, she fled, despising the vows to which she had sworn allegiance when she first joined the Order.~ /*I will not describe our initiation rituals to you, <CHARNAME>, but the Silent Lord claims many who undertake them. Only the few who survive, as I did, are welcomed into the Order of the Long Death.*/
@69 = ~And you followed her here?~
@70 = ~You follow here here?~
@71 = ~NP: I couldn't follow her immediately; the ruinous ritual left me broken and weak. But when I recovered, my instructor came to me and explained what needed to be done. Alaganda had refused to give the Silent Lord what was rightfully his. And for that, she had to die. Since I was the sole survivor of the most recent ritual, it was my privilege to kill her.~ /*Alaganda has denied the Silent Lord that which is rightfully his. For this she must die. And because I am the lone survivor of the most recent initiation, I am the one given the privilege of killing her.*/
@72 = ~If I am ever to advance further in the Order of the Long Death, I must bring back proof of Alaganda's death to my Masters.~
@73 = ~Proof? What kind of proof?~
@74 = ~I'm not going to just stand by and watch you kill an innocent woman!~
@75 = ~NP: Alaganda always wore a hammered silver ring, stamped with her family's crest, a soaring falcon against the full moon. After it has been on her finger for so many years, the ring cannot be removed, and as long as she lives, she is unlikely to part with it willingly. The Silent Lord has many tools for his harvest; Alaganda could submit either to the plague or to another misfortune. But I will search all over the city until I either kill her or discover a ring that proves to me that she is already dead.~ /*The Silent Lord has many tools to reap his harvest, Alaganda may have succumbed to the plague or other... misfortune. But I will search the city until I either kill her or find the ring that proves she is already dead.*/
@76 = ~I'll help you find and kill Alaganda - or at least help you find her ring.~
@77 = ~She's probably dead already, and the ring could be anywhere in the city. You'll never find it.~
@78 = ~NP: Who among us is truly innocent, <CHARNAME>? Alaganda has participated in the rituals of the Lingering Death, she has killed those you would also call 'innocent'. And she has betrayed her vow to my Order. The penalty for that is death. I will find her, and I will kill her. If you can't accept that, then we should part ways.~ /*Who among us is truly innocent, <CHARNAME>? Alaganda has participated in the rituals of the Long Death, she has slain many who you would call 'innocent'.*/
@79 = ~NP: This is completely wrong. I should leave you immediately, Grimgnau.~ /*This isn't right. I must part ways with you now, Grimgnaw.*/
@80 = ~NP: Actually, I wouldn't be too upset if this woman died.~ /*Actually, I don't have a problem with killing this woman.*/
@81 = ~I will not rest until I find the ring that proves Alaganda has been taken by the Silent Lord, though I know my chances of success are... few.~
@82 = ~I have a ring here with a falcon on it. Is this the ring?~
@83 = ~If I find it I'll let you know.~
@84 = ~As long as you don't let your search interfere with your service to me!~
@85 = ~NP: Your words are cruel, but there is some truth in them. But I will not give up my task so easily. I will not rest until I find the ring that will prove that Alaganda was taken by the Silent Lord, though I realize that my chances of success... are slim.~ /*I will not rest until I find the ring that proves Alaganda has been taken by the Silent Lord, though I know my chances of success are... few.*/
@86 = ~NP: Yes, it's Alaganda's ring! This is the proof I've been looking for; now I know that the Silent Lord took her after all. How foolish I was to flee, for there is no place where Death will not find us. I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small trinket, but it's all I have.~ /*Yes, this is Alaganda's ring! This is the proof I needed; now I know she has been taken by the Silent Lord. She was a fool to flee - there is nowhere we can run that Death cannot find us.*/
@87 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. But for now we must return to the task at hand. The Silent Lord's hunger must be fed with a constant supply of new victims.~
@88 = ~My service to you will draw many into the cold grasp of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. Death surrounds you. I would be a fool to let my other mission distract me from following in your bloody wake.~
@89 = ~You have proved yourself a true servant of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. Take this amulet; all who join the Long Death are given a similar talisman.~
@90 = ~NP: Thank you, Grimgnau.~ /*Thank you, Linu.*/
@91 = ~That's it? A cheap amulet?~
@92 = ~It will not save you from the Silent Lord when He finally chooses you, but it will grant you some protection from succumbing to those who would deliver you into his grasp before your appointed time.~
@93 = ~NP: This amulet has a power of its own, <CHARNAME>. It will not save you from the Silent Lord when he eventually chooses you, but it will give you some protection from defeat by those who try to get you before your appointed time arrives.~ /*It will not save you from the Silent Lord when He finally chooses you, but it will grant you some protection from succumbing to those who would deliver you into his grasp before your appointed time.*/
@94 = ~NP: Eventually I will return to my Order and report back to them that Alaganda is dead. But that can wait until your assignment is complete. The Mark of Death is upon you, <CHARNAME>. As long as I remain with you, I know I serve the will of the Silent Lord.~ /*Eventually I will return to my Order and report Alaganda's death to them. But this can wait until your mission here is done, <CHARNAME>.*/
@95 = ~NP: The essence of those taken by the plague was stolen straight from the terrible grip of my lord, Death. This disease is cheating the Silent Lord out of what is rightfully his. I do not know how we can stop the Howling Death, but I yearn to search the Beggar's Nest for an answer to this.~ /*The essence of those claimed by the plague has been stolen from the terrible grasp of my master, Death. This sickness cheats the Silent Lord of what is rightfully his.*/
@96 = ~Why are you so interested in the Beggar's Nest?~
@97 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@98 = ~We should continue on as we are - the Silent Lord is pleased with our work. Other than this I have no advice to give you.~
@99 = ~NP: I've heard some rumors about zombies roaming the streets in this nasty neighborhood. Few things are so strongly disliked by my order as the abomination of the undead. It would be reasonable to imagine that there is some connection between the appearance of the undead and those who have fallen to the unnatural onslaught of the Howling Death.~ /*I have heard rumors that in that blighted district zombies walk the streets. Few things are so reviled by my order as the abomination of the undead.*/
@100 = ~Did you ever investigate the Beggar's Nest on your own?~
@101 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~
@102 = ~Then we should continue with your mission. The Silent Lord is hungry for us to deliver more souls to His gaping maw.~
@103 = ~NP: I can hardly survive the dangers in this area alone, and throwing my life away recklessly is a very foolish way to serve the Silent Lord. My death will come at the appointed time. I can't think of anything else to say to you, <CHARNAME>.~ /*Alone I am not likely to survive the dangers of the district, and throwing my life away is a foolish way to serve the Silent Lord. My death will come in its appointed time.*/
@104 = ~Yes, we should continue with your mission. The Silent Lord is eager for us to feed his endless hunger with more souls.~
@105 = ~If we're going to be traveling together I'd like to know a little more about you.~
@106 = ~NP: I'd like you to keep telling your story, Grimgnau.~ /*I'd like you to continue your story from before, Grimgnaw.*/
@107 = ~NP: I wouldn't mind hearing the continuation of your story, Grimgnaw.~ /*I'd like you to continue your story from before, Daelan.*/
@108 = ~NP: I am a priest of the Order of the Protracted Death, <CHARNAME>. My behavior is governed by the tradition, tenets, and beliefs of my Order. To put it simply, I worship Death. Understand, I don't give a damn about the petty deities who scandalize each other trying to take patronage over death, for I serve Death himself, the Silent Lord who rules over us all.~ /*Understand, I care nothing for the petty Gods who squabble over and lay claim to death's portfolio, for I serve Death itself, the Silent Lord who rules us all.*/
@109 = ~NP: Tell me more about your order, Grimgnau.~ /*Tell me more about your Order, Grimgnaw.*/
@110 = ~NP: Is your order on the side of evil, Grimgnau?~ /*Is your Order evil, Grimgnaw?*/
@111 = ~NP: Then I have no questions.~ /*That's all the questions I have.*/
@112 = ~I suspect in practice we are similar to your own Order, though our beliefs and values may be somewhat different.~
@113 = ~NP: We are trained by the Order of Protracted Death, trained by and serving the Masters. We endeavor to transform the mortal world through mental discipline and philosophical understanding of Death. We honor every aspect of the Silent Lord, and we also honor the tools that prepare us all for the inevitable, inescapable end: pain, suffering, torment, and agony.~ /*We of the Long Death train, study and serve our Masters. We strive to transcend the earthly world through mental discipline and philosophical understanding of Death.*/
@114 = ~There are some who call us evil, for they fear the pain and death we spread. But we transcend morality. Death is not good or evil, it simply *is*. It is final, undeniable and perfect.~
@115 = ~Our beliefs are difficult for most to accept, and the Order of the Long Death has many powerful enemies.~
@116 = ~What kind of enemies are you talking about?~
@117 = ~You worship death - it's no wonder you have enemies!~
@118 = ~NP: Our choice of the Silent Lord as an object of worship has brought us into conflict with many who do not understand the true beauty of Death. Many of the mortals fear the end of the journey; for most of them, we will use simple pain, agony, suffering and torture to free them from this fear. We will prepare them for the cold embrace of the Silent Lord.~ /*Many fear their mortal end; for most we will simply use pain, anguish, torture and suffering to release them from this fear. We will prepare them for the cold embrace of the Silent Lord.*/
@119 = ~But there are some who go to extremes to avoid their fate. They use foul rituals and dark necromancy to deny the Silent Lord that which is his due.~
@120 = ~You're talking about the undead, right? Liches and zombies and the like.~
@121 = ~NP: Who are you talking about?~ /*What are you talking about?*/
@122 = ~NP: The undead are a vile perversion, a denial of the natural order of things. We who serve the Lingering Death are in constant conflict with necromancers and their minions. I have had to fight my own war with the undead, <CHARNAME>.~ /*The undead are a foul abomination, a denial of the natural order. We of the Long Death are in constant conflict with necromancers and their minions.*/
@123 = ~This is not the time to speak of such things, <CHARNAME>. We must focus on rooting out the cult responsible for the Wailing Death. Perhaps we can speak of this later... when the time is right.~
@124 = ~NP: I mentioned earlier that my order hates the abomination of the undead, <CHARNAME> - and I've already hinted that I've had experience in battles with them. I wasn't going to dredge up those memories, but if we're going to fight together, I think you deserve me to tell the story.~ /*I am not eager to dredge up those memories, but if we are to stand together you deserve to hear the tale.*/
@125 = ~What stories?~
@126 = ~NP: Let's talk some other time. I don't have time right now.~ /*Let us speak of something else.*/
@127 = ~NP: Shortly after I came to join the Order of the Lingering Death, one of our brethren returned with terrible news. He had discovered the lair of a powerful lich. Our service to the Silent Lord demanded that we immediately destroy such an affront to Death, and we set out on a quest to destroy the vile creature, ending its god-awful existence.~ /*Our service to the Silent Lord demands that we destroy such an affront to death, so we marched forth to destroy the foul creature and end its unholy existence.*/
@128 = ~I myself never faced the lich in battle, but I was one of many assigned the task of destroying the lich's zombie and skeleton servants. Never have I felt such revulsion or terror during a battle.~
@129 = ~I thought you liked killing and death.~
@130 = ~What was so scary about zombies and skeletons? They aren't so tough.~
@131 = ~NP: Death itself is beautiful. The exquisite agony of the wounded soldier, the rising crescendo of screams, before the perfect note of eternal silence is sounded. The serpentine torture movements of a beating body transformed into the majestic truth of a coldening body frozen forever. But when the body is not still, when the dead continues to drag dead legs, stumbling, in a crude parody of living flesh - where then is the beauty of Death, <CHARNAME>?~ /*But when a corpse is not still; when the dead continue to shamble and stumble forward in a gross caricature of living flesh - where is Death's beauty then, <CHARNAME>?*/
@132 = ~I didn't realize you were so squeamish.~
@133 = ~NP: You're just a psychopath, Grimgnau.~ /*You're a sick man, Grimgnaw.*/
@134 = ~NP: On this day, my Order destroyed dozens of zombies in the crypt, <CHARNAME>. Their bodies disintegrated under the blows of a rain of rotting flesh, but they marched inexorably forward. But the true horror was yet to come. From the back of the crypt, from where the higher monks were fighting the lich himself, black waves of necromancy were spreading across the battlefield.~ /*But the true horror was yet to come. From the back of the tomb where the highest ranking monks of the Order battled the lich herself waves of dark necromancy spilled out over battlefield.*/
@135 = ~Several of my companions had fallen during the battle and as the foul spell touched their corpses they clambored to their feet, zombies under the will of the enemy we sought to destroy.~
@136 = ~You mean you had to kill some of your own companions?~
@137 = ~NP: We do not fear death, <CHARNAME>, and if I could bring the touch of the Silent Lord to my fallen comrades, I would not remember this battle with such disgust. But a zombie has no mind, and feels nothing. The pain that purifies and prepares us for death means nothing to such creatures; the understanding of the approaching moment of death such creatures never possess.~ /*But a zombie has no mind, it feels nothing. The pain that purifies and prepares us for death has no effect on such creatures; the understanding that comes during the moment of death is forever denied to such creatures.*/
@138 = ~NP: I was destroying these pieces of animal flesh that used to be my brothers and sisters in the Order, but I couldn't truly kill them. The undead cannot be granted such a release. Finally, the lich was destroyed, as were all of his minions. We burned his lair, spreading fire throughout the crypt, to ensure that black magic would be forever purged from this sacred resting place of death.~ /*The lich was destroyed, as were all its minions. We burned its lair, setting fire to the crypt so that the dark magic might be cleansed from a sacred place of death.*/
@139 = ~But even though we were ultimately victorious, the cost was terrible. The horror of the battle haunts me still - as does the fate of my fallen brothers and sisters from the Order.~
@140 = ~NP: How sad to hear this account of what happened to the others.~ /*I'm sorry for what happened to the other monks of your Order, Grimgnaw.*/
@141 = ~NP: Well, the zombies are now destroyed. Death is death.~ /*Yeah, whatever. I have a question.*/
@142 = ~Enough with the memories. Don't let this interfere with your duties to me!~
@143 = ~I thank you for your words, <CHARNAME>, though I doubt you truly understand. You bring death and destruction, but you do not understand it as we of the Long Death.~
@144 = ~You couldn't possibly understand, <CHARNAME>. You are a harbinger of death, but you do not understand it as we of the Long Death.~
@145 = ~The true horror of what happened to my brothers and sisters is too terrible to comprehend; but I have vowed to free them from the torment of their undeath.~
@146 = ~How do you plan to do that?~
@147 = ~NP: Are you seriously hoping for that?~ /*You're set on this path?*/
@148 = ~NP: You are a true servant of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>; you bring death and pain to this world. But for now, you are not yet a member of the Order. My Order has secrets that I cannot yet share with you. This is not the time to talk about such things. We must devote all our energies to eradicating the cult that unleashed the Howling Death. Perhaps we can talk later. at a more appropriate time.~ /*You are a servant of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>; you bring death and pain to the world. Yet even so you are not a member of the Long Death. My Order has secrets I am not yet ready to share with you.*/
@149 = ~NP: My Order has many secrets, <CHARNAME>. These secrets we do not trust to anyone who exists outside the monastery. But you have managed to prove your friendship with the Lingering Death. Perhaps you will do my Order a favor, for without your help, I fear my brothers will never escape their terrible fate.~ /*My Order has many secrets, <CHARNAME>. Secrets we do not reveal to those outside our monastery. Yet you have proven yourself a friend of the Long Death before.*/
@150 = ~NP: What do you want from me?~ /*"What do you want me to do?"*/
@151 = ~I don't think I want to get involved with this.~
@152 = ~NP: I should explain what happened after we burned the lich's lair to the ground. The bodies of those of our brethren who were raised to fight against us were taken back to my Order. There we attempted ancient rituals to separate their essences from the curse that had bound them to their animated bodies. But the shackles of non-life are not easily broken.~ /*I should begin by explaining what happened after we burned the lich's lair. The corpses of our own, those who had risen against us, were brought back to the monastery of my Order.*/
@153 = ~NP: So be it. You are not bound by the obligations of my Order; you have no vow of loyalty to the Silent Lord. I vouchsafed to follow you on this quest, and I will continue to do so, for you bear the mark of my Lord.~ /*I have pledged to accompany you in this mission, and I will continue to do so for the mark of my Master is upon you.*/
@154 = ~The ancient rituals require rare components and we had many casualties. A few we were able to save, but the others remain traped in undeath until we can find more of the necessary components for the ritual.~
@155 = ~What kind of components are you looking for?~
@156 = ~NP: The components must be taken from the lair of a strong undead monster, but it must be something that is not tainted by that creature's necromancy. For example, we could use the preserved arm of a non-animated body lying in the crypt of a mummy. Only the power of such an object can free the essence of my siblings for the embrace of the Silent Lord.~ /*The components must come from the crypt of a powerful undead monster, but it must be something that has not yet been tainted by the creature's necromancy.*/
@157 = ~NP: I will not give up my search for the sectarians behind the plague; I have sworn to help you destroy those who have placed the vile stain of Howling Death upon the world. But during our mission, I will not abandon my search for the mummified hand of an unliving corpse that can free my fellows from the fate of the undead.~ /*But during our mission I will not give up my search for the mummified hand of an inanimate corpse that can release my brethren from undeath.*/
@158 = ~I have a mummified hand here. Will this do.~
@159 = ~Don't worry, I'm sure we'll find the components you're looking for.~
@160 = ~Just don't let this get in the way of your other duties.~
@161 = ~NP: Let me see. Yeah, that could work. The undead spoil hasn't touched this desiccated limb yet. Look at this severed arm, <CHARNAME>. See how the flesh has withered, stretching the skin, exposing the most delicate perfection of the bones hidden within? Isn't it beautiful? I thank you for this, <CHARNAME>, on behalf of the Order of the Lingering Death. I have no reward to give you, excluding the blessing of my Order.~ /*Look at this severed hand, <CHARNAME>. See how the withered flesh has grown so tight and thin it exposes the delicate perfection of the bones beneath? Isn't it beautiful?*/
@162 = ~NP: The reward you offer is greater than you can imagine, Grimgnau.~ /*The reward you offer is greater than you know, Grimgnaw.*/
@163 = ~Great. That and a couple coppers will get me a mug of warm ale.~
@164 = ~NP: You will find that the blessing has empowered the amulet I gave you when I received Alaganda's ring from you. And I will say again, <CHARNAME>, how grateful I am to you. Now let us return to our current task - those who let the Howling Death loose must be punished!~ /*Once again, <CHARNAME>, I thank you. Now let us return to the task at hand - those behind the Wailing Death must still be dealt with!*/
@165 = ~NP: You are a true servant of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>, that is a proven fact. Take this amulet; all who join the Howling Death wear similar talismans. Now, let's return to our current task - those who let the Howling Death loose must be punished!~ /*You have proved yourself a true servant of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. Take this amulet; all who join the Long Death are given a similar talisman.*/
@166 = ~For the sake of my undead brothers and sisters, I can only hope so.~
@167 = ~This is but one aspect of my sevice to the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. The other is to follow your lead as you spread death and destruction across the land.~
@168 = ~NP: The location of the cult you seek is safely hidden. However, I would not be surprised to find that they are somehow connected to the village of Charwood. This little town is isolated from the rest of the world, far south of Port Llast. Few outside of my Order can recall such a place even existing.~ /*The town has isolated itself from the rest of the world, far to the South of Port Llast. Few outside my Order even remember such a place exists.*/
@169 = ~Tell me about Charwood.~
@170 = ~That's enough information for now.~
@171 = ~NP: This town is a strange place; it has a stain of corruption that we members of the Order can sense, but we cannot describe what curse hangs over it. It would not surprise me if this unnatural place revealed some connection to the cult that sows Howling Death, but I can hardly say anything else about it.~ /*It would not surprise me to discover links to the cult behind the Wailing Death in that unnatural place, though I can tell you little else about it.*/
@172 = ~Have you ever been to Charwood?~
@173 = ~NP: I have never been there myself, but I know it is far south of Port Llast. I know, however, that some great danger lurks there. My Order has sent many emissaries to scout that area, but none have ever returned. There is some ferocious and dangerous force at work in Charwood, but I cannot say what it is. That's all I know.~ /*My Order has sent many emissaries to investigate the region, but none have ever returned. There is some fell and dangerous power at work in Charwood, though what it is I cannot say.*/
@174 = ~I wouldn't mind knowing your thoughts on Aribeth's betrayal. How do you feel about it?~
@175 = ~I want you to continue with what you were telling me before.~
@176 = ~NP: I have mixed feelings about this paladin's actions. It is said that she came to treachery after the execution of her lover - she couldn't accept his death, and it filled her with a frenzy of grief and a thirst for vengeance. For a member of the Lingering Death Order, her reaction to this inescapable event was rather childish. The Silent Lord comes to us all; but we can also learn to accept his coming.~ /*I have mixed feelings about the paladin's actions. They say she was driven to her betrayal by the execution of her lover - she could not accept his death and it drove her mad with grief and a desire for revenge.*/
@177 = ~NP: Accepting death is one thing. Seeing your lover hanged right in front of your eyes is quite another.~ /*Accepting death is one thing. Having your lover hung right in front of you is something else.*/
@178 = ~So you disapprove of what she has done?~
@179 = ~NP: Would she have been better off if her lover had been gutted by a hungry troll? Or if his limbs were ripped from their joints by an angry giant? Or perhaps her anger would have been less if the slow-acting poison had plunged him into a sleep from which he would never rise? Death is death, <CHARNAME>. My Order is trying to make the world realize that.~ /*Or perhaps she would have been less angry had a slow acting poison drawn him into a sleep from which he would never awaken? Death is death, <CHARNAME>. My Order seeks to help the world understand this.*/
@180 = ~NP: Her motives seem foolish to me, but I am pleased with the results. She brought war to the North. Thousands upon thousands are dying suddenly and painfully, from blades she drew from their sheaths. The Silent Lord longs for the feast at the table Aribeth has set for him. And while Death satiates himself with citizens and soldiers alike, I will be here to watch my Lord's gluttony.~ /*The motives for her actions seem foolish to me, but the results are pleasing. She has brought war to the North. Thousands will die painful, shrieking deaths beneath the blades she has unleashed.*/
@181 = ~That's a horrible thing to say!~
@182 = ~NP: You're a bloodthirsty freak, Grimgnau. And I love it!~ /*You're a bloodthirsty freak, Grimgnaw. I like it!*/
@183 = ~NP: You're crazy and evil, Grimgnau. You're a little too evil for my taste.~ /*You're a sick and evil man, Grimgnaw. Too evil for my taste.*/
@184 = ~NP: You only say that because you don't understand the mysteries of the Silent Lord. If you were able to understand the truth of Death, my words would not seem so horrible to you. As a priest of the Order of the Silent Death, I have been present at rituals and ceremonies that evoke a dignified appreciation of what the rest of us in our ignorance can only fear. Torture, pain, suffering, and even Death itself are all very beautiful things.~ /*As a monk of the Long Death I was subjected to rituals and ceremonies that brought a true appreciation for that which others fear in their ignorance. Torture, pain, suffering and even death itself - these things are beautiful.*/
@185 = ~NP: I can't believe such things can be beautiful. You evil, evil gnome!~ /*I could never believe these things to be beautiful, Grimgnaw. You're an evil, evil man!*/
@186 = ~NP: I kill out of necessity, but I have strong doubts about it being so beautiful.~ /*I kill when I have to, Grimgnaw, but I doubt I'll ever see anything beautiful in it.*/
@187 = ~NP: You have a love of death and bloodshed that is rarely found outside of our Order, <CHARNAME>. But even you cannot realize the true beauty of Death or the mystery of the Silent Lord. As a priest of the Order of the Silent Death, I have been present at rituals and ceremonies that evoke a proper appreciation of what the rest of us in our ignorance can only fear. Torture, pain, suffering, and even Death itself are all very beautiful things.~ /*As a monk of the Long Death I was subjected to rituals and ceremonies that brought a true appreciation for that which others fear in their ignorance. Torture, pain, suffering and even death itself - these things are beautiful.*/
@188 = ~NP: You bring destruction everywhere in your path, <CHARNAME>. Your motives may be good or evil, but that means nothing. Death will always be at your shoulder, for the Silent Lord himself has put his mark on your forehead. If I could share with you the experience of my initiation, you would have the opportunity to see a glimpse of what Death truly stands for-the one pure, absolute truth of our imperfect existence.~ /*If I could share the experiences of my initiation you might begin to glimpse some small hint of what Death truly means - the only pure, absolute truth in an imperfect existence.*/
@189 = ~I'd never want to hear about that stuff anyway!~
@190 = ~So enlighten me. Tell me about your Order's rituals.~
@191 = ~NP: I take it that you will never get a chance to understand things that way. You seem to have trouble accepting that you are a messenger of death.  Until you realize that it is your destiny to supply sacrifices to the Silent Lord, I will not be able to share the wisdom of my Order's initiation with you.~ /*I imagine you would not be ready for such understanding anyway. You seem to have difficulty accepting that you are a harbinger of death.*/
@192 = ~No, <CHARNAME>, now is not the time. Eager as you are I am afraid you are not ready for the wisdom I would share.~
@193 = ~Perhaps later I will speak more of this, but now is not the time. You are not yet ready. Let us return to our mission, for in doing so we will surely spread death throughout the North.~
@194 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. The beauty of death is not easily understood, but if you are willing I will tell you of some of the rituals I endured when I joined the Long Death.~
@195 = ~I want to hear about the rituals.~
@196 = ~Not just yet.~
@197 = ~NP: Before a novice is accepted into the Order, he must first learn to appreciate the beauty of death. We must wander through cemeteries and crypts in search of this beauty. We must live and dwell between the worlds of the living and the dead. We must surround ourselves with what others view as horror or abomination.~ /*Before an initiate can be accepted into the Order they must first learn to appreciate the beauty of death. We must walk the cemeteries and graveyards in search of this beauty.*/
@198 = ~NP: For many, this is the easiest part of our training. I myself marveled at the bodies lying on the battlefield, I understood the perfect truth of their deaths. The next stage of our training is to begin to understand the tools that the Silent Lord uses to prepare us for death. Pain, suffering, grief and agony.~ /*The next phase of our training is to understand the tools the Silent Lord uses to prepare us for death. Pain, suffering, sorrow, agony.*/
@199 = ~NP: We participate in the torture of the victims, witnessing the sweet release they receive when they finally submit to death. And afterward, we subject ourselves to the same torture that our victims experienced. We savor the pain and suffering; they burn out the part of us that binds us to the mortal world.~ /*And then we subject ourselves to the same torments as our victims. We taste the pain and suffering as it burns away that part of us which clings to the mortal world.*/
@200 = ~You subject yourself to torture?~
@201 = ~NP: Only by experiencing pain can we understand how it prepares us to bow before the altar of the Silent Lord. Pain is part of the underworld, but it can free us for the next world. The Silent Lord takes many during this stage of initiation. Those whom he has chosen to further serve himself in this world, that is, those who survive, continue the training.~ /*Only through experiencing such pain can we understand how it prepares us to kneel at the altar of the Silent Lord. Pain is of this world, but it can release us to the next.*/
@202 = ~In the next stage of our initiation we must become true servants of the Silent Lord. We must murder three people - a rich old man, a poor young woman and a new born child.~
@203 = ~NP: What kind of monster are you, Grimgnau? You deserve to die!~ /*What kind of monster are you, Grimgnaw? You deserve death!*/
@204 = ~Why does it have to be those specific three victims?~
@205 = ~We all deserve death, <CHARNAME>. That is one of the fundamental truths of my Order. And in time we will all surely get what we deserve.~
@206 = ~Fine. Go on.~
@207 = ~NP: By killing a rich old man, a poor girl and a newborn baby, we learn that we are all subject to the Silent Lord - men, women, young, old, rich and poor. Death owns us all. The next time we are brought before the wheel is a simple test, but it betrays more novices into the hands of the Silent One than any other. The wheel teaches us that the Silent Lord makes his choices to please Himself, not us. We are subject to whim and chance, death is random.~ /*By slaying a rich old man, a poor young woman and a new born babe we learn that all of us are subjects of the Silent Lord - male, female, young, old, rich, poor. Death has dominion over us all.*/
@208 = ~How does the wheel work?~
@209 = ~NP: The wheel is made of alternating black and white squares. If the pointer stops on a white square, we all move on to the last initiation. If it stops on the black square, we are immediately killed. When we started the initiation, there were six people entering the Order. Two died on the rack, one was caught after killing an elderly rich merchant and hanged.~ /*The wheel is made of alternating white and black squares. If the pointer stops on a white square we move on to the final initiation. If it stops on a black square we are slain on the spot.*/
@210 = ~That left three of us to face the wheel. I alone survived to face the final challenge.~
@211 = ~What was the final challenge?~
@212 = ~Seems like your Order likes to kill off it's members. That's kind of foolish.~
@213 = ~That I am not yet ready to share with you, <CHARNAME>, for I have not yet completed it.~
@214 = ~But I thought you were a member of the Order already!~
@215 = ~NP: Aren't you already a full member of the order?~ /*Don't you care about your child?*/
@216 = ~Our initiations are necessary for us to truly understand what Death is and what it represents. What we lack in numbers we make up for in conviction.~
@217 = ~NP: I am a priest of the Lingering Death, <CHARNAME>. A final challenge is absolutely necessary for one who is about to enter the inner circle of my Order. I would ask for your help in this endeavor, but this challenge is sacred to the Order. Despite all your deeds, I am still not convinced that you can already know our most sacred secret.~ /*I want to ask you for aid in this, <CHARNAME>, but this challenge is sacred to the Order. Despite all you have done I am not yet certain you are ready to learn of our most hallowed secret.*/
@218 = ~NP: If I were in my order, I could consult with the elders, but in their absence I can only wait for some sign to appear to me. Only if I receive that sign will I be able to tell you about the last trial, <CHARNAME>. I may talk to you more about it later, but now is not a good time. You don't have the right readiness in you yet. Let's get back to our task, for in doing so, we are certainly spreading death throughout the North.~ /*Were I back at the monastery I could consult with the elders, but in their absence I can only wait and see if some sign is delivered to me. Only if I receive this sign will I be able to tell you of the final challenge, <CHARNAME>.*/
@219 = ~NP: I was expecting a directive from the Silent Lord before I discussed the matter with you, <CHARNAME>. But I realize now what a fool I was. You are the Silent Lord's instrument. You bring his will to this world, and spread death in your path. The Silent Lord brought us together for a reason!~ /*You are a tool of the Silent Lord. You enact His will upon this world, spreading death everywhere you go. The Silent Lord has brought us together for a reason!*/
@220 = ~You are here to aid me in this challenge, <CHARNAME>. The very fact that you are here is proof the Silent Lord wants me to ask for your help in this task!~
@221 = ~A task?~
@222 = ~I can't help you with anything until I find the Words of Power.~
@223 = ~I must assassinate one of the inner circle's members. Only by delivering one of their number into the Silent Lord's hands am I worthy to join them.~
@224 = ~NP: Seems simple enough.~ /*Sounds simple.*/
@225 = ~I will not force you to aid me in this, <CHARNAME> - though I fear I will not succeed without your help. If you change your mind speak to me again.~
@226 = ~There is a... a catch, <CHARNAME>. It is forbidden for one of my Order to slay one of the inner circle unless we use a weapon blessed by the inner circle themselves.~
@227 = ~NP: Why would they bless a gun if someone could use it to kill them?~ /*Why would they bless a weapon just so someone else can use it to kill them?*/
@228 = ~NP: You forget, <CHARNAME> - we do not fear Death. This custom exists to ensure that the murderer of a member of the inner circle is a monk worthy of such honor. When someone from our Order joins the inner circle, they must place a blessing on an implement that can be used to take them to the Silent Lord. This weapon is then run and hidden far away, in a place full of danger.~ /*When one of our Order joins the inner circle, they must bless a weapon that may be used to deliver them to the Silent Lord. They then take the weapon and secret it away in a place of great danger.*/
@229 = ~Finding one of these blessed weapons requires luck, skill and fate. In fact, we believe only the guiding hand of the Silent Lord will deliver a blessed weapon into the possession of one of our Order.~
@230 = ~So you want me to find this weapon for you?~
@231 = ~So wouldn't my help be a violation of your Order's beliefs?~
@232 = ~At first I feared enlisting your aid would be sacriligious. However, now I realize that you are a tool of the Silent Lord. You are here specifically to help me find one of the blessed weapons.~
@233 = ~How will I recognize one of these blessed weapons?~
@234 = ~NP: All sacred instruments bear the symbol of my Order, the outstretched hand of the Silent Lord that reaches out to take us all. Fear not, <CHARNAME>. While you seek the Words of Power, I will serve you. And in serving you, I am simultaneously serving the Silent Lord's will. If I find one of the sacred weapons, I will pass it on to you so that you can continue to create your body-carved, bloody legend.~ /*If I am meant to find one of the sacred weapons it will be in your service as you continue to carve out your blood steeped legend.*/
@235 = ~I have a dagger here with a skeletal hand on it. Is this one of the blessed weapons?~
@236 = ~Then if the Silent Lord wills it, we'll find one of the sacred weapons.~
@237 = ~This vision quest better not interfere with your duty to me!~
@238 = ~NP: Yes, it's the mark of my Order. Wait... I sense a slight aura emanating from this blade. Yes, it is one of the weapons blessed by the inner circle! And once again you prove that you are a true servant of my lord, <CHARNAME>. I bestow upon you this talisman, a gift that normally can only be worn by members of my Order.~ /*Once more you have proved yourself an agent of my Master, <CHARNAME>. I bestow upon you this talisman, a gift normally reserved only for those of my Order.*/
@239 = ~NP: Thank you for such a reward, Grimgnau.~ /*I thank you for this reward, Grimgnaw*/
@240 = ~I feel like I'm getting screwed in this deal.~
@241 = ~I could not have spoken it more truly myself, <CHARNAME>.~
@242 = ~You are an instrument of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. I will continue to serve you even as you continue to serve Death itself.~
@243 = ~The talisman has powerful magical properties bestowed by my Order, <CHARNAME>. Its power is not to be underestimated.~
@244 = ~What are you going to do now, Grimgnaw?~
@245 = ~NP: The dagger is just the beginning for me, <CHARNAME>. I now have the ability and the right to send one of the inner circle members into the arms of the Silent Lord. Though the inner circle are those who are the most powerful of the entire fraternity of my Order, and if I am to slay one of them, I must surpass everything I have learned.~ /*The dagger is only the beginning for me, <CHARNAME>. I now have the ability - and the right - to deliver one of the inner circle to the Silent Lord.*/
@246 = ~Once I feel I am worthy I will challenge one of the inner circle to a battle to the death. But of course, all this must wait.~
@247 = ~Wait? Wait for what?~
@248 = ~NP: Your task here is not yet accomplished, <CHARNAME>. You still seek the Words of Power, and in so doing you bring death and destruction to your enemies. It is a great honor to serve you, and I will not abandon you until your task is complete.~ /*Your task here is not yet done, <CHARNAME>. You still seek the Words of Power, and in doing so you still bring death and destruction to your foes.*/
@249 = ~NP: Fear not, <CHARNAME>. As long as you seek the Words of Power, I will serve you. And in serving you, I am simultaneously serving the will of the Silent Lord. If I find one of the sacred weapons, I will hand it over to you so that you can continue to create your body-carved, bloody legend.~ /*If I am meant to find one of the sacred weapons it will be in your service as you continue to carve out your blood steeped legend.*/
@250 = ~Perhaps I can help you, for long ago my dwarf clan dwelt in the Dragon Mountains, though when Bruenor Battlehammer reclaimed Mithral Hall we left to join the others of our kind who flocked to his banner.~
@251 = ~What can you tell me about the Dragon Mountains?~
@252 = ~NP: Okay, you can tell me about it some other time, I don't have time right now.~ /*I'm sorry, but I don't have time right now.*/
@253 = ~NP: I know that these mountains bear their name for a reason, for huge worms can be seen there quite often, hovering in the moonlight in the sky. There are many legends of great treasures guarded by winged serpents and powerful artifacts that can be found in their lairs. I would not insist on Words of Power specifically, but it is conceivable that such a mighty object could well be found in a dragon's lair.~ /*At night great wyrms could often be seen soaring over the moonlit skies. There were many legends of the hoards these winged serpents guarded, and many rumors of the mighty artifacts that could be found within.*/
@254 = ~How do we get to the Dragon Mountains?~
@255 = ~NP: These mountains are far to the west of Beorunn's Well, beyond the hills that are inhabited by giants. In the days when my clan lived there, the giants meant nothing; we often sent out warriors who reduced their numbers and chased them all the way to the caves where they lived. But after my clan left, I heard that the giants became strong and powerful.~ /*In the days of my clan the giants were of little consequence; we often sent warriors to thin their numbers and chase them from their caves. Since my clan left, however, I have heard the giants have grown powerful and bold.*/
@256 = ~NP: I've even heard that the hill giants have a king, but I can't tell if those rumors are true. We would have to explore the area to know for sure. That's all I know, that's all I have to say.~ /*I have even heard talk of a hill giant king, though I cannot say if the rumors are true. We would have to investigate the region to be certain.*/
@257 = ~NP: You've been dismissive of things that are important to me, I don't want to talk about it anymore.~ /*Let us return to the topic of your mission, and speak of this no more.*/
@258 = ~<CHARNAME>, there is something I must tell you, something I would say now, before the Silent Lord claims me and forever stills my breath.~ [NWGRIMSY]
@259 = ~NP: Yes, Grimgnau, what is it?~ /*Yes, Grimgnaw - what is it?*/
@260 = ~NP: Not now, Grimgnau! I don't have time, you know!~ /*Not now, Grimgnaw! I'm kind of busy here!*/
@261 = ~NP: The time of the great slaughter is at hand, a sumptuous feast of bloodshed and death awaits the Silent Lord. But before my lord begins his meal, I have something to tell you. My entire life has been dedicated to the worship and service of the Silent Lord, <CHARNAME>. I exist only to send others into the hands of my master. I am an instrument of Death.~ /*A great slaughter is coming, a magnificent feast of bloodshed and death has been laid before the Silent Lord. But before my master gorges himself, there is something you must hear.*/
@262 = ~I understand, <CHARNAME>. A great slaughter is coming. If you care nothing for my words, I shall not deny you the pleasure of savoring the impending death and destruction.~
@263 = ~No, tell me what you have to say.~
@264 = ~Good, keep quiet. We've got business to take care of!~
@265 = ~To serve my master I have fought at your side. I have seen the mark of the Silent Lord upon you, and I am humbled in your presence. You have been touched by Death, and all living creatures tremble at your approach.~
@266 = ~Don't sell yourself short, Grimgnaw. You spread as much bloodshed as I do.~
@267 = ~*Sigh* I guess people holding me in awe is the burden of being a hero.~
@268 = ~NP: I only resort to murder when necessary, Grimgnau.~ /*I only kill when I have to, Grimgnaw.*/
@269 = ~Let us deliver Morag into the hands of my master, that Death may finally claim her!~
@270 = ~NP: I have sent many to the Silent One since we met, but I owe this to you alone. It was only with you that I was able to fully realize my abilities. Since joining you, I have seen Death in all its glory, and enlightenment has finally come to me. I have gained knowledge of the Silent Lord that not even my order could give me.~ /*Since joining you in your quest I have seen Death in all its glory, and I have at last achieved an enlightened understanding of the Silent Lord that surpasses even the teachings of my Order.*/
@271 = ~You still refuse to see admit the truth. But I have seen with my own eyes the gruesome fate of those who oppose you.~
@272 = ~It may be my time to bow down to the Silent Lord in this coming battle; but at last I am truly ready to accept his claim upon me. For this I thank you, <CHARNAME>.~
@273 = ~Are you saying you expect to die in this battle?~
@274 = ~NP: Hold on, dwarf. We're not done here.~ /*Save it, dwarf. Our work here isn't done.*/
@275 = ~NP: The Silent Lord's throat has opened, and he is ready to devour the Ancients who deprived him of his opportunity to get his own by slumbering in the Source Stone. I will gladly sacrifice my own life to satisfy my lord's hunger. We will deliver Morag directly into my lord's hands, and Death will finally catch up with her!~ /*The maw of the Silent Lord gapes wide, eager to feast upon the Old Ones who have cheated him of his just due with their hibernation within the Source Stone. I would willingly sacrifice my own life to feed my master's hunger.*/
@276 = ~NP: Your words are true. The Silent Lord's throat has opened, and he is ready to devour the Ancients who deprived him of his own by sleeping in the Source Stone. We will deliver Morag directly into my lord's hands, and Death will finally catch up with her!~ /*Your words are true. The maw of the Silent Lord gapes wide, eager to feast upon the Old Ones who cheated him of his just due through their hibernation within the Source Stone.*/
