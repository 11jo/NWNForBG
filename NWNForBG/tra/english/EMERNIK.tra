@0 = ~Pull that lever. It locks the door so we'll be safe.~
@1 = ~Psst! Into the lockdown, quick, before the patrols see us!~
@2 = ~You're not with the prisoners, are you?~
@3 = ~No, I had to fight my way through them to get here.~
@4 = ~... Why do you ask?~
@5 = ~MT: Да, я заключенный... Отправляйся в одну из камер, не то пожалеешь.~ /*Yeah, I am... Get back to your cell or face the consequences.*/
@6 = ~Thank goodness you've come, then. They've been going from cell to cell, killing us guards... I think I'm the last one left.~
@7 = ~Who are you, anyways?~
@8 = ~Think you could answer some questions for me?~
@9 = ~All right, get out of here then.~
@10 = ~You're mistrusting - not the sign of a hunter. I guess that means you're being hunted, just like me. I'm the last guard left, I think.~
@11 = ~Yeah? Well, now that I've got you cornered, I'm going to take you down like I did the last one - point blank.~
@12 = ~Just a guard. The name's Emernik.~
@13 = ~I don't see why not. We're safe in here.~
@14 = ~What's the Head Gaoler up to?~
@15 = ~What do you know about this floor of the prison?~
@16 = ~I need you to follow me.~
@17 = ~All right, wait here.~
@18 = ~The people in those cells were my friends. Abandon their memory if you want, stranger, but I'm here for some vengeance.~
@19 = ~The Head Gaoler? He was torturing some of us former guards on the bottom level until we managed to escape.~
@20 = ~The bottom level? How many levels are there?~
@21 = ~Why was the Head Gaoler torturing you?~
@22 = ~Who's helping him?~
@23 = ~Okay, enough questions about the Head Gaoler.~
@24 = ~It's the Security Layer - Supposed to be a buffer zone between the regular prisoners and the troublemakers we throw down in the Pits...~
@25 = ~The Pits? What are those?~
@26 = ~Are the doors locked or unlocked?~
@27 = ~Where are the former prisoners holed up?~
@28 = ~I need supplies. Are there any storerooms?~
@29 = ~That's all I need to know about the prison.~
@30 = ~At your command.~
@31 = ~Sure thing. I'll secure the area.~
@32 = ~Four in total. The top two are the prison proper. The bottom two are the Pits.~
@33 = ~He kept talking about cutting us, getting inside our heads. Some of our guys came out of there looking like zombies. The rest of us were... discarded.~
@34 = ~The Head Gaoler's right hand man is a half-orc named Kurdan Fenkt, one of the meanest prisoners in the Pit.~
@35 = ~Agreed. The Head Gaoler's a monster - We have to put a stop to him.~
@36 = ~That's where you're headed. There aren't many cells down there except those the prisoners built themselves. What they did in the Pits was their business...~
@37 = ~The cell doors are locked but the others should all be open. If you can get inside a lockdown and seal it up, you should be safe inside.~
@38 = ~They've barricaded themselves in the central guard room. They're sending out patrols but it's pretty haphazard - I've killed off a couple without them noticing...~
@39 = ~Yeah, you'll find them to the north and south.~
@40 = ~Just be careful. This is place is a deathtrap right now.~
@41 = ~Think we'll survive the day?~
@42 = ~Looks like things are cooling down. I'm going to stay around here and try to get things back in order. Thanks for the help.~
