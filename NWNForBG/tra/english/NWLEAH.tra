@0 = ~Oh? Over here! Oh, thank the - I thought I was going to die. Everytime they came close to me, their foul smells - I was so scared.~ [NWLEA051]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Leah. My name is Leah. I was working on the farm when I was attacked by those beasts. They kidnapped me, and - oh...~
@4 = ~Leah! I need to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~I spoke with your husband, Leah. He thinks that you're dead.~
@6 = ~All right. It should be safe for you to get out of here, Leah.~
@7 = ~I didn't expect to find any prisoners. Can you get out on your own?~
@8 = ~I'll go make sure it's safe. Can you wait here? I'll come back.~
@9 = ~Please, don't go! I don't want to be left in here, not alone... I'm so scared. It's so dark...~
@10 = ~NP: What? What questions? What do you want to ask for?~ /*Oh? What kind of questions? What did you want to ask?*/
@11 = ~What can you tell me of these caves?~
@12 = ~Why did the monsters kidnap you?~
@13 = ~He does? He - oh... this has been so horrible. I just want to go home. Will you help me escape?~
@14 = ~NP: Certainly. You can leave, the path is clear.~ /*Then you are free to go. The way behind me is clear.*/
@15 = ~Thank you so much, kind <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I wish I could show you my appreciation. Please come and visit me and my husband when you are done here.~
@16 = ~I... I suppose I could, yes. You did kill the monsters that were guarding me, right?~
@17 = ~Yes. Just follow the trail of carnage and you'll be fine.~
@18 = ~You want me to... wait here? In this place? I guess I have no choice in the matter, but please hurry back! Please...~
@19 = ~I don't really know... it's pretty dark in here and I haven't been able to see too much. They generally just screamed at me and kept me in here. Every once in a while, they would drag me out and force me to do something for them: menial labor, for the most part. When I finished the cooking, stitching, what have you, they'd throw me back in here.~ /*I don't really know... it's pretty dark in here and I haven't been able to see too much. They generally just screamed at me and kept me in here.*/
@20 = ~You should get out of here now.~
@21 = ~Just to do some menial labor, it would seem. Nothing too heavy or exhausting, really. Though it didn't make this any easier on me... I've been sick, exhausted, hungry... I can't sleep anywhere, and I just want to get back to my husband.~ /*Just to do some menial labor, it would seem. Nothing too heavy or exhausting, really. Though it didn't make this any easier on me...*/
@22 = ~I hate to keep asking questions, but did they mention anything?~
@23 = ~Um... come to think of it... they mentioned something about their "master." It was more like a threat to them, though, to keep them in line. It was as if the truly heroic monsters would be rewarded by this monster some how. Well, that's the impression that I got from it.~ /*Um... come to think of it... they mentioned something about their "master." It was more like a threat to them, though, to keep them in line.*/
@24 = ~Please! Don't leave me here again, I beg of you. My name is Leah. My husband must be so worried!~ [NWLEA054]
@25 = ~(sob) I miss my family!~ [NWLEA050]
@26 = ~NP: Wait here? Ill be back soon.~ /*"Wait here until I return."*/
@27 = ~Thank you so much for all you have done!~ [NWLEA056]
