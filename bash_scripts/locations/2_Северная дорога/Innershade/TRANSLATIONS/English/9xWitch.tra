@0    = ~Who comes? Why are you here? This is not a place for you or any of your kind. It's not place for anyone. Leave immediatly, I want to be alone! I want to sleep for now and forever... Why someone must always disturb me? Why must something like this always happen... Can't I at last leave your world behind...? Leave...~
@1    = ~No. You have left something behind. I came here to give it back. (Allow Dream to speak through you.)~
@2    = ~I came here to end your sleep. Prepare to die monster.~
@3    = ~I agree to leave. Send me back - I will never bother you again.~
@4    = ~You won't kill me easly.~
@5    = ~I will let you go. Leave me and never come back...~
@6    = ~(The creature stays silent. She looks at you with mixed curriosity, confusion and fear in her eyes. It is obvious that she didn't expect to be found in her assylum.)~
@7    = ~*It's good to see your again, m'lady. Is this what you wished for? Are you happy with your state? Into what you have become...*~
@8    = ~It is you... I... I should have expected you. Why did you come?~
@9    = ~(You feel emotions growing inside of you - emotions that are not yours.) *You thought that I wouldn't expect to meet you again? You have really lost part of you. Why have you abandoned me? I want to know your story. I have seen everything through a mist. I want to know how you see things now.*~
@10   = ~You know what I have seen - the death of my parents. Later I was told that my mother's friends who took care of me died. The nightmare was growing bigger and bigger. I just wanted to be alone, to live a peaceful life in the forest where I could practise my skills, where I could gaze the stars, where I could face the embers of the bonfire. I had to run away.~
@11   = ~When I thought that I reached my peace, he came - a boy whom I once loved. I knew him only for a few moments, but I felt as if something I'd long been missing had finally arrived. But when we talked... he felt confused, he wanted to leave... I just couldn't be hurt again! I couldn't stand it! I turned him to stone and talked to him every evening.~
@12   = ~You shouted when I was sleeping, you showed me visions and images. Do you think it's easy to face wishes and dreams? Memories? Both painful and happy? To see images of the person I could have become? I just had to leave you behind...~
@13   = ~*You did not even remember those important images. The moment you killed your mother's friend. Even then you couldn't stand the pain, you let it become a sin - you killed her.*~
@14   = ~(The creature again stays silent. She gazes at you. You gain a new insight - the Dream seems to be responsible for what its creator has become.)~
@15   = ~*You know... when you eluded me on your run through the forest, I just become a shadow in the echoes of your soul. You are right - it is I who showed you who you could become, but I didn't mean to hurt you. I wanted you to chase your dreams...*~
@16   = ~(Before the Dream ends the sentence, the creature stops it with a request.) Please, come back. I want to find the peace I had with you - the one in the dreams - the only one I am able to catch. That was my assylum, not this place without an exit.~
@17   = ~*It's not for me to decide. It's <CHARNAME> who made me live. It is <PRO_HESHE> who must let me be with you. <CHARNAME>, be our judge.*~
@18   = ~The decision is yours. I will face it. I can't run away again. (The Dream doesn't speak anymore - you are the one who can speak. The creature awaits your judgement.)~
@19   = ~You have faced your decision. I can't just see you both suffering for eternity. Dream, join with your creator as you should have done long ago.~
@20   = ~You are responsible for taking lives, for the torment the Dream caused. You are egocentric person who shouldn't be allowed to live. My judgement is death.~
@21   = ~You deserve each other. Dream, I will leave you here - you will have to live inside this sick assylum of hers. You will stay silent forever, and you, 'creator', may talk with one who can't speak, just as you talked with boy you turned to stone. I will leave you here until time destroys you both. It will be torment for you both.~
@22   = ~Thank you...~
@23   = ~(The creature accepts the decision. Your judgement has killed her.)~
@24   = ~(After few seconds everything around starts to tremble. You do not feel the Dream inside of you, it died the moment the creature accepted the judgement. Magical energy teleports you from the asylum an instant before the ceiling hits the ground.)~
@25   = ~This is the torment I have to face then... (After a moment, you no longer feel the Dream inside of you. The creature makes a sign in the air and suddenly you feel magical energy teleporting your away from this place.)~
@26   = ~At last, I am who I was... once more I have the part of myself that I lost so long ago. Thank you. Your verdict has allowed me to become myself again. Now I can dream again, pass away... (She comes closer to you; a small crystal shard appears in her hand. Suddenly her hand disappears inside of your chest, but you do not feel pain. It's like a stream of cold water begins to flow through your body. Then she takes out her hand, but without the shard.) It is a gift.~
@27   = ~(Witch seems to fade. She starts to call out to someone.) I see you, my lover... I see you in the forest... You are not stone anymore? I am glad to see your face again.~
@28   = ~I will follow you. I will. I have dreamed about it for so long... (The witch smiles. Seconds later, her dead body hits the ground. A moment later, magical energy teleports you away from the wich's assylum.)~
