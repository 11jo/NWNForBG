@0 = ~Hey there dear, what can I do for you?~ [LINA050]
@1 = ~I just want to talk for a while.~
@2 = ~Nothing, I'm all right.~
@3 = ~I love chatting with you, but don't you think we should focus on your mission right now?~
@4 = ~If we're going to be working together, I'd like to know more about you.~
@5 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@6 = ~NP: Do you have any tips or suggestions for our searches?~ /*Do you have any advice or suggestions you can give me about my mission?*/
@7 = ~As you wish.~
@8 = ~NP: I can understand this, because I spent many years away from home and friends. I would also like to know you better. OK<CHARNAME> , What do you want to know?~ /*I guess that is understandable. I have been away from my home and friends for a long time now. I would like to get to know you too.*/
@9 = ~Why did you leave your homeland?~
@10 = ~What happened to make you hate thieves so much?~
@11 = ~What are your memories of your home like?~
@12 = ~NP: I think we should trust each other a little more. I have to ask you not to make fun of me, it's such a stain on my reputation. Years ago, a cleric served the people of Evereska by uncovering a plot by the drow to destroy the city. Sehanine Moonbow rewarded this priest with a silver cup.~ /*Many years ago, a cleric performed a service for the people of Evereska by uncovering a drow plot to destroy the city. Sehanine Moonbow came and presented the priest with a silver goblet.*/
@13 = ~And that is what was stolen?~
@14 = ~You lost a gift from a goddess?~
@15 = ~NP: I think I'd be happy to share my frighteningly difficult task with you, my friend. Both you and I are adventurers. If I trust you with my life, then I should trust you with everything that worries me. Forgive me for being so desperate, but you see, the Moonbow Silver Chalice was once mine. I discovered her in a small town called Lorch, but after that... oh,<CHARNAME> I lost her again!~ /*We are both adventurers. If I trust you with my life, I should trust you with my troubles. I am sorry I was so overcome with despair, but you see, I found the Silver Chalice of Moonbow once already.*/
@16 = ~How in the name of all that is holy did you lose it again?~
@17 = ~Why did I ever decide to pick you as a companion?~
@18 = ~I know I shall probably never find the chalice again, <CHARNAME>, but I shall not give up. I must return it to my people to restore my honor.~
@19 = ~Is this the chalice you were talking about?~
@20 = ~If I find it I'll let you know.~
@21 = ~Just don't let your quest get in the way of mine. You work for me, not the other way around.~
@22 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, I should not have said so much. We will talk more about this later, but not now.~
@23 = ~NP: I always wanted to be an adventurer<CHARNAME> . I have a natural curiosity about everything around me, and I want to experience what I used to read about in books. But I'm from Evereska, this is the birthplace of philosophers, magicians, scientists and explorers of mysteries. Few are adventurous and usually looked down upon in my homeland. With one exception.~ /*I always wanted to be an adventurer, <CHARNAME>. I have a natural curiosity about everything, and I wanted to experience the things I read in books.*/
@24 = ~Oh? Who is that?~
@25 = ~NP: It's clear. We'll speak another time.~ /*Sure, another time.*/
@26 = ~NP: It's been a long time since anyone asked me this question. I came to Sehanine Moonbow when I was still very young, which is unusual, because my parents were both magicians and worshipers of the god Corellon. It all started when I was sent to Gaedolin Sentristi's Gift School. You see, my parents were both steeped in secrecy and held respected positions. I was supposed to follow in the footsteps of my parents in the study of magic.~ /*My... it's been a long time since someone asked me that question. I came to Sehanine Moonbow when I was very young, which is unusual, since my parents were both mages and followers of the god Corellon.*/
@27 = ~What are 'potentials'?~
@28 = ~But you didn't take after them?~
@29 = ~I wish I could be more helpful, <CHARNAME>. All I really know about is the Blacklake district, but otherwise I know nothing of the city.~
@30 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@31 = ~NP: I don't know where this cult might be hiding, but I've heard rumors indicating where they might strike. This concerns the strange events in the forest of Neverwinter. I don't know much in particular, but it looks like a ranger has recently come into town from there, and he says that the animals savagely attack anyone who enters the forest, or at least passes by.~ /*I don't know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling tales of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.*/
@32 = ~A ranger?~
@33 = ~That's enough information for now.~
@34 = ~I don't really know anything about these lands, except what I have read in books.~
@35 = ~What have you read?~
@36 = ~It seems like we're doing alright so far, so I'm not sure what to tell you. Maybe it'd be best if we just kept on doing what we're doing.~
@37 = ~NP: (Sighs) You don't start with easy questions, do you? This question will not be easy to answer, but I will try. Before I left my home, I worked for six years at the Full Moon Temple. I really liked the peaceful atmosphere of the temple. But even there, failures and jokes of fate burdened my life. Usually it was the little things. More often than not, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't even know why, I just got unlucky.~ /*But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn't usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know why, but I just didn't have any luck.*/
@38 = ~Well, bad luck happens to all of us at one time or other.~
@39 = ~You'd better not bring any bad luck my way.~
@40 = ~NP: These dirty, mean, low, SCARY, EVIL... um, sorry. I'm shaking just thinking about them. Most of my problems were related to thieves. To be honest, it was because of the thieves that I left my house. Before I left my home, I worked for six years at the Full Moon Temple. I really liked the peaceful atmosphere of the temple. But even there, failures and jokes of fate burdened my life. Usually it was the little things. More often than not, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't even know why, I just got unlucky.~ /*But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn't usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know why, but I just didn't have any luck.*/
@41 = ~NP: I have both good and bad memories of the house in Evereska. I was never able to settle down there, and all because of my ... predisposition to trouble, let's call it that. I still remember how I once fell while playing Tambalia and all the kids ran around me and sang &quot;Man, man, Lina man.&quot; (Sighs) Even children can be cruel sometimes. I put up with it for 60 years.~ /*I have good and bad memories of my home in Evereska. I never fit in too well, mostly because of my... accident-prone nature, I guess you could call it.*/
@42 = ~There were good times too, right?~
@43 = ~(Snicker) That's, um... terrible Linu.~
@44 = ~I'd have beat some sense into them.~
@45 = ~Do elven children really call each other humans, in a bad way?~
@46 = ~Yes. The thief stole it right out of the temple and managed to sneak out of Evereska, no small accomplishment there.~
@47 = ~It wasn't my fault... well, it was... but I... oh, it was terrible.~
@48 = ~NP: Like I said, I found the bowl in a market town called Lorch. A thief, a halfling, tried to sell it to a Zent merchant, but when the halfling charged 500 gold, Xent demanded that this religious artifact be given to him as a 'tribute to Bane'. The halfling thief objected, but the city's mayor was also a Zhentarim. And before the halfling could blink, he was already arrested for the murder of an old woman who had spat in the face of a Zenta soldier the day before.~ /*As I said, I found the chalice in the merchant town of Llork. The thief, a halfling, tried to sell it to a Zhent merchant, but when the halfling tried to charge him 500 gold, the Zhent claimed the religious artifact as 'tribute to Bane'.*/
@49 = ~I know. I berate myself all the time, and beg for Sehanine to blast me into oblivion for failing her so!~
@50 = ~How did you lose it?~
@51 = ~NP: Silver Moonbow Bowl! Thank you,<CHARNAME> â€œI can never repay you for this gift of true friendship. There is something that would certainly be useful to you. This is the Elven Amulet. It can enhance some of your abilities, making them similar to those of those with elven blood.~ /*There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.*/
@52 = ~Thank you, dear <CHARNAME>. But don't let my concerns interfere with your duty to Aribeth. My problem was self-inflicted, curing the plague is more important.~
@53 = ~Oh, dear <CHARNAME>. You are always so focused on one thing. Don't worry so much, I won't let you down.~
@54 = ~NP: Sint La'neral was an attractive, charismatic, intelligent and adventurous archaeologist. He was respected in Everesk and in other intellectual communities such as Waterdeep. He was Evereska's most promising bachelor.~ /*He was respected within Evereska and other intellectual circles in places like Waterdeep. He was considered the most eligible bachelor in Evereska.*/
@55 = ~Your husband.~
@56 = ~And YOU managed to hook him?~
@57 = ~As you wish. We should probably continue with your mission in any case.~
@58 = ~NP: All children of gifted wizards in Evereska are sent to a special school as &quot;gifts&quot; because they are expected to further develop the magical arts. My ability to get into situations was already evident then, but my parents kept it a secret, hoping that with age it would pass.~ /*All children of gifted wizards in Evereska are sent to special schools as 'potentials', because they are expected to excel in furthering the art of spellcraft.*/
@59 = ~Okay, go on.~
@60 = ~Boy, were they wrong.~
@61 = ~NP: I worked for a while in the Heart of the City, but spent most of my time in the slums of Blackshire. The slums separate the wealthy district from the rest of the city. The bodies of plague victims lie there right on the streets, without any attention from the guards or healers. There were so many patients there that I just couldn't cope. Although I couldn't be of real help, I tried my best to ease their pain.~ /*Bodies of plague victims lay in the streets, unattended by guards or healers. There were to many sick and I couldn't keep up. Not that I helped much, but I tried to help ease their pain as much as I could.*/
@62 = ~NP: Yes. I don't remember his name, but he stayed in Port Llast for a long time. It is possible that the townspeople know where it can be found. This rumor may be empty, but I have a hunch that something important is behind it. Since they failed to break us with this terrible disease, I would not be surprised to hear that this cult has infected a plague of wild animals.~ /*Yes. I don't remember what his name was, but he was in Port Llast for a while. It is possible that the townsfolk might know where he is. It may be nothing, but I have a feeling it could be important.*/
@63 = ~Is there anything else you know about the cult?~
@64 = ~I understand. We must keep our efforts focused on rooting out those responsible for the Neverwinter plague.~
@65 = ~NP: I read something about the ancient ruins that are located far to the south of here. As for them, I have read that they contain traces of the presence of an ancient culture whose knowledge of magic was beyond anything we have today. I think that such magic, which is contained in the Words of Power, is most likely somehow connected with deep antiquity.~ /*I have read about some ancient ruins, to the far south of here. What I read of the ruins is that they contain traces of ancient cultures, whose knowledge of magic ran deeper than any living today.*/
@66 = ~Magic?~
@67 = ~NP: Although, it was not always a matter of luck. Sometimes I was just too naive. Because of this, I got into trouble, after which I had to leave Evereska. Once, a stranger in a raincoat approached the temple for alms. He looked like a child dying of hunger, so I took him into the sanctuary and went to get food, and when I returned, he was gone. But along with him, something else, very valuable for the temple, disappeared.~ /*I was collecting tithes one day, when a heavily cloaked figure came begging at the temple. He looked like a starving child, so I took him inside the inner sanctum to get him some food and when I came back, he was gone.*/
@68 = ~What did the thief steal?~
@69 = ~You really are a piece of work. You better not bring catastrophe down on me.~
@70 = ~NP: You don't have to talk to me like that. I am very careful. Your mission is important to me too.~ /*No need to talk to me in that tone of voice, <CHARNAME>. I am being very careful. Your mission is very important to me too.*/
@71 = ~NP: There were good times too. I loved the mysteries and magic of our homeland. And when I grew up, everything changed. Before I left my home, I worked for six years at the Full Moon Temple. I really liked the peaceful atmosphere of the temple. But even there, failures and jokes of fate burdened my life. Usually it was the little things. More often than not, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't even know why, I just got unlucky.~ /*But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn't usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know why, but I just didn't have any luck.*/
@72 = ~I suppose I can laugh about it now, but it wasn't very funny back then. I don't know why that came to mind. I shouldn't have said anything.~
@73 = ~I shouldn't have said anything about that. I don't know why that came to mind all of a sudden.~
@74 = ~NP: The other priests were furious. Only the high priest was willing to give her up so that someone else could have her. But, of course, that didn't happen. It happened to the one who broke off the head from the golden statue of Corellon. I didn't know what to do and stayed up there all night, praying to Sehanine to guide my path. The goddess heard my prayers and even before the first ray of the sun she sent me a vision.~ /*The other priests were frightfully mad. Only the head priest was willing to concede that it could have happened to someone else. But, of course, it didn't. It happened to the person that broke the head off the golden statue of Corellon.*/
@75 = ~What happened in the vision?~
@76 = ~What, did she tell you to get the hell out of Evereska before you doomed them all?~
@77 = ~NP: I saw myself leaving Evereska on a long journey. And at the end of this journey, I returned with a bowl. But I saw the journey itself as if through a haze. I had no idea where to go, the only directions were west and north. When I told the priests about my vision, which was supposed to take me far away from them, they arranged a joyful celebration in honor of my upcoming sacred campaign. And at that moment, for the first time in my life, I felt where my place was.~ /*When I told the priests of my vision that would take me far away from them, they held a cheerful celebration in honor of my sacred quest. It was the first moment in my life when I felt I truly belonged.*/
@78 = ~Yes, I'm sure they were very happy... for you.~
@79 = ~You're just a little clueless aren't you?~
@80 = ~Do you have a single kind bone in your <PRO_RACE> body? I have not doomed us; I have kept you alive in fact. My accidents have never cost someone their life.~
@81 = ~But now they will never welcome me back to their city. My quest has failed.~
@82 = ~Surely it has not failed. You will find it someday.~
@83 = ~We can find it, Linu, if we work together.~
@84 = ~Good. I'm paying you to keep me alive, not to worry about some stupid quest.~
@85 = ~I... well... no, it's just easier to accept it that way. And if I'm clueless, at least I'm not exceedingly RUDE!~
@86 = ~No, you do not understand. No one will ever understand. I shall be an outcast for life!~
@87 = ~NP: As you say<SIRMAAM> .~ /*As you command, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.*/
@88 = ~Obviously he never committed the crime. It never fails to shock me when people are capable of such injustice.~
@89 = ~How did you find all of this out?~
@90 = ~Sounds like he had just about as much luck as you do.~
@91 = ~NP: I found out what was happening when I came to the city and saw that the crowd had already gathered to watch him hang. Everyone was chuckling and telling the story to anyone who wanted to hear it. They really thought that such injustice was funny. Even that cursed merchant was there to watch the execution, and he drank from the sacred cup!~ /*I found out what had happened when I showed up in town and saw a mob of people about to hang him. Everyone was laughing and telling the story to anyone who would listen. They actually thought that such injustice was funny.*/
@92 = ~I can't believe he would do that!~
@93 = ~That's a Zhent for you.~
@94 = ~Now that takes a lot of gall.~
@95 = ~Don't compare me to that babyfaced, good-for-nothing weasel! I should have let him hang!~
@96 = ~NP: They had already put the noose around the halfling's neck when they finally told me what the matter was. I didn't know what to do, but it had to be stopped. I ran through the crowd, yelling at them to stop, but... I... got entangled in the folds of my robe and fell into the mud. I looked up and saw the face of a pretty old woman. I extended my hand to her, when suddenly ... she gave me her fist right in the teeth.~ /*I ran forward into the crowd, yelling for them to stop, but... I... I tripped and fell in the mud. I looked up and saw the face of a kindly grandmother. I reached for her hand and... she kicked me right in the teeth.*/
@97 = ~That's horrible.~
@98 = ~You got beat up by an old woman?~
@99 = ~Yes, so I have discovered.~
@100 = ~Don't admire him! There is nothing admirable about men with no honor.~
@101 = ~NP: The crowd turned into a gigantic dump, the people hooted and waved their fists. I got out of the crowd and ran, crying from impotence. I reached the edge of the forest and hid in the roadside bushes. And as I lay there and cried, I heard the crackling of a twig. I turned and saw a halfling standing behind me.~ /*I made it to the forest and collapsed in the bushes off the road. As I lay there weeping, I heard a twig snap. I spun around and standing there behind me was the halfling.*/
@102 = ~NP: It may seem ridiculous now, but at that time it was just some kind of horror. The crowd turned into a gigantic dump, the people hooted and waved their fists. I got out of the crowd and ran, crying from impotence. I reached the edge of the forest and hid in the roadside bushes. And when I lay there and cried, I heard the crackling of a twig. I turned and saw a halfling standing behind me.~ /*I made it to the forest and collapsed in the bushes off the road. As I lay there weeping, I heard a twig snap. I spun around and standing there behind me was the halfling.*/
@103 = ~He winked at me and toasted me with the chalice, which he held in his hand. I cried out that I had to have it back, but he just laughed and disappeared into the wood. I never saw him again.~
@104 = ~Don't worry Linu, I'll help you find the chalice.~
@105 = ~Better forget about it then. He probably sold it and you'll never find it again.~
@106 = ~Thank you, sweet <CHARNAME>. That is a kind answer from a good friend.~
@107 = ~I know I shall probably never find the chalice again, <CHARNAME>, but I shall not give up. I must return it to my people to restore my honor.~
@108 = ~NP: On this day, you managed to prove that you are a true friend of the Elven people. I'm proud to call you my friend<CHARNAME> .~ /*You have proven this day that you are a true friend to the elven people. This pendant only works for those who prove such worthiness. I am proud to be able to call you my friend, <CHARNAME>.*/
@109 = ~Thank you, Linu.~
@110 = ~That's it? A pendant?~
@111 = ~NP: It's thanks to you<CHARNAME> , I can now return the bowl to where it should be. I will protect her with my own life until I have the opportunity to pay a visit to Evereska. Until that moment arrives, I will fight for you and help you achieve your goals. Thank you my dear friend.~ /*Because of you, <CHARNAME>, I can return the chalice to where it belongs. I shall protect it with my life until the opportunity arises for me to visit Evereska.*/
@112 = ~NP: Don't underestimate its merits. The real power of this medallion lies within you. It's thanks to you<CHARNAME> , I can now return the bowl to where it should be. I will protect her with my own life until I have the opportunity to pay a visit to Evereska. Until that moment arrives, I will fight for you and help you achieve your goals. Thank you my dear friend.~ /*Because of you, <CHARNAME>, I can return the chalice to where it belongs. I shall protect it with my life until the opportunity arises for me to visit Evereska.*/
@113 = ~NP: Actually, I didn't like it at first. I was reading a text about an ancient race in the temple library. The author described his adventures in search of the missing relics in exotic, dangerous places. I slammed the book on my desk shut and loudly called the author a lying, pompous jerk. Next to me, buried in a book, sat another elf in a chair. He asked me what I was reading.~ /*I slammed the book on the table, calling the author a lying, pompous fool. Another elf was sitting on a chair near me with his face in a book. He asked me what I was reading.*/
@114 = ~Don't sound so shocked. You sure know how to make a woman feel special, don't you?~
@115 = ~I told him the name of the book and he laughed. In my youthful arrogance I went on to list the large number of errors in the author's logic.~
@116 = ~Was it really that bad?~
@117 = ~Thought you were pretty smart, huh?~
@118 = ~NP: When I finished, he began to refute my every construction. It was, I quickly guessed, Sint La'neral himself. When I realized what a mistake I had made, I yelped and ran away from the hall. Despite my oversight, I must have made some impression on him, from that very day he began to persecute me. In the end, he won my heart, though the venture almost cost him his life.~ /*Despite my blundering, I must have made an impression on him, for he pursued me from that day on. Eventually he won my heart, though only through an act that almost cost him his life.*/
@119 = ~What did he do?~
@120 = ~NP: Well yes, but I quickly realized how stupid I was. When I finished, he began to refute my every construction. It was, I quickly guessed, Sint La'neral himself. When I realized what a mistake I had made, I yelped and ran away from the hall. Despite my oversight, I must have made some impression on him, from that very day he began to persecute me. In the end, he won my heart, though the venture almost cost him his life.~ /*Despite my blundering, I must have made an impression on him, for he pursued me from that day on. Eventually he won my heart, though only through an act that almost cost him his life.*/
@121 = ~Let us not talk of such things right now, sweet <CHARNAME>. We must hunt down the cult responsible for the Wailing Death. Perhaps we can speak of this later... when the time is right.~
@122 = ~NP: My first day of class was a real disaster, but I don't think it has anything to do with my ability to cast spells. I had an insatiable curiosity, and Gaedolin was a wayward old teacher who thought all elf children would be quiet and studious. I barely have enough of these qualities even today, to say nothing of my childhood years.~ /*I had an insatiable curiosity, and Gaedolin was a crotchety old master who expected all elven children to be patient, quiet, and orderly. I barely possess those traits now, let alone when I was a child.*/
@123 = ~The master decided to open class with a powerful spell, to awe us into submission to his tutelage. He turned his back and I moved in.~
@124 = ~What do you mean by moved in?~
@125 = ~NP: It never occurred to me that it was possible to be worse than you are now.~ /*I didn't think it was possible for you to be worse than you are now.*/
@126 = ~NP: I just wanted to look at the components for the spell. They were very interesting, especially the shiny gem that hung from his belt. Well, he reached for the stone, only it was no longer there. The spell went awry, and as a result, he began to smoke lilac smoke and this dragged on for several weeks.~ /*Well, he went to reach for the gem, and it wasn't there. The spell misfired, causing him to ooze purple smoke for weeks.*/
@127 = ~So he kicked you out?~
@128 = ~I'd have kicked you out too, how stupid.~
@129 = ~It was curiosity, not true mischievous behavior, although I suppose the results were often the same.~
@130 = ~Gaedolin was well paid for training us. He didn't kick me out right away, but he never forgave me either. It also wasn't the only 'accident' to befall the class when I was around.~
@131 = ~NP: It was just a childish wish! I was very young. Gaedolin was well paid for our training. He didn't kick me out, of course, but he never forgave me. Besides, it wasn't the only &quot;accident&quot; that happened to me in class.~ /*Gaedolin was well paid for training us. He didn't kick me out right away, but he never forgave me either. It also wasn't the only 'accident' to befall the class when I was around.*/
@132 = ~NP: But in spite of all this, I still could have become a sorceress, if not for that little trip. Everyone in the city remembers this incident to this day. My destiny was sealed with Sehanine's faith that day.~ /*Despite all of this, I might still have become a wizardess, if it wasn't for the little trip I took. That was an accident that will long be remembered in our fair city.*/
@133 = ~What fate would that be?~
@134 = ~Little trip?~
@135 = ~NP: I'll be sure to tell you about my dimensional jump later. We have too much to do right now to tell this story. We need to find the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.~ /*We have too much to do right now to tell that tale. We need to find the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.*/
@136 = ~The people of the slums have become so desperate that many of them attack intruders on sight, hoping for even just a single gold coin.~
@137 = ~Anything else?~
@138 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~
@139 = ~NP: I've heard of some kind of zoo where wealthy citizens keep exotic animals for their own amusement. Their conditions are simply disgusting. I never went there myself. I have enough sick townspeople to take care of the poor animals, too, but I know that there is a druid here in the Heart who was looking for someone to help the unfortunate animals. That's really all the useful information I can give you, sorry.~ /*I never actually went there. I had enough sick people to worry about the misery of the animals, but I know there is a druid here in the core who is looking for someone to free the poor creatures.*/
@140 = ~That is all I know. I guess we just need to investigate until we can find some real evidence of cult activity. I thought the woods might be a good place to start.~
@141 = ~NP: I am an elf from Evereska, a land where solving mysteries is more than just a journey, where it is considered a higher calling. The ruins to the south call to me, as if they hold the knowledge we all need. I suppose it may just be my heritage that pulls me to explore something old and different like these ruins, but maybe there is more to it.~ /*I am an elf of Evereska, a land where studying the mysteries is more than a path, it is the highest calling. The ruins to the south call to me, as if they hide knowledge that is imperative to us all.*/
@142 = ~I will follow your lead as always, my dear <CHARNAME>. You are a better judge of such things than I am.~
@143 = ~Please forgive me, <CHARNAME>. I can talk no more about this. We don't know each other well and I can't share my most embarrassing moment with a stranger.~
@144 = ~Perhaps we will not become the best of friends. I will not be distracted from our task again. Let's go.~
@145 = ~Tell me, how do you like being an adventurer?~
@146 = ~NP: Tell me more about your meeting with Sint.~ /*Tell me more about you Order, dwarf.*/
@147 = ~I'd like you to tell me more of your story, Linu.~
@148 = ~I have an unusual seed right here. Is this it?~
@149 = ~What made you decide that you should be a cleric?~
@150 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@151 = ~NP: You are truly my friend<CHARNAME> . Maybe you can help me with this. Sint retired from the life of an adventurer for several years. Then he returned home with the news that he had discovered the ancient city. The moment he said those words, I knew he was about to embark on another great journey. I wanted to go with him, but I had to prepare a festive ceremony at the temple.~ /*I knew as soon as he uttered those words that he would be off on another of his grand adventures. I wanted to go with him, but I was involved in preparing a special celebration for the temple.*/
@152 = ~He wouldn't wait for you?~
@153 = ~So? Why couldn't they do it without you?~
@154 = ~NP: We will find these cultists<CHARNAME> and justice will be done. Maybe then I can continue my search. I'm sure the diary exists somewhere, and one day I'll find it.~ /*We will find the cultists <CHARNAME>, and justice shall be done. Then perhaps I can resume my quest.*/
@155 = ~I found this journal. It has your husband's name on it.~
@156 = ~Don't worry, we'll find the journal and discover what happened to your husband.~
@157 = ~Just don't let this get in the way of your other duties.~
@158 = ~Let us not talk of such things right now, sweet <CHARNAME>. We must hunt down the cult responsible for the Wailing Death. Perhaps we can speak of this later... when the time is right.~
@159 = ~NP: I think he was deliberately waiting for the moment until I got stuck in something that I could not quit. So he wanted to protect me. Sint had a friend, a magician, who created two diaries. Through them we could write to each other daily, keeping in touch. I don't know why, but he never wrote me about his adventures or events around him. Instead, he wrote down thoughts, philosophical discussions about life and the mysteries of being. I would like now that he writes more about where he is going.~ /*I don't know why, but he never wrote to me about his day or his quest. Instead he would write about his thoughts and philosophies on life and the mysteries. I wish he had written more about where he went.*/
@160 = ~Why is that?~
@161 = ~You figure he was fooling around on you?~
@162 = ~It was the first time I had been given a leadership role in the church. I couldn't back out on it. Now I wish I had.~
@163 = ~NP: In his last entry, he wrote out several pages for a letter about how much he loves me, and that, no matter what happens to him, I must continue on my way. I knew something was wrong and begged him to tell me, but he ignored my pleas. The last entry was about how he hears that someone is approaching again. And it's all.~ /*I knew something was wrong and I begged him to tell me, but he ignored my pleas. The last thing he wrote was that he could hear them coming again. That was it.*/
@164 = ~No! Synth wouldn't do such a thing. Don't profane his memory, please.~
@165 = ~<CHARNAME>, someday I shall find the caves Synth was exploring and I will try to find that journal. I think that if I could do that, I would be able to get past his ghost that haunts my dreams.~
@166 = ~NP: Do you want to know how Sint won my heart? I think I can tell you about it. I could not meet Sint because, after our first unexpected meeting, I decided never to approach him. This was easier said than done considering how dashing he was as an adventurer. One night, he climbed the ten-story wall of my parents' house and climbed through the window.~ /*I couldn't face Synth, since our embarrassing encounter I had decided never to be near him again. Easier said than done when dealing with a daring adventurer.*/
@167 = ~Then what happened?~
@168 = ~Ten story wall? Your parent's must be rich.~
@169 = ~NP: That's all. Oh... oh Synth, my love. You, so you... really left. I... thought it would be easier for me. I knew he was... but the pain is still strong. ABOUT,<CHARNAME> , this is all because of me. You should leave me before my evil fate kills you too.~ /*That's it. Oh... oh Synth, my beloved. You really are... gone then. I... I thought it would be easier than this. I knew he was... but it still hurts. Oh, <CHARNAME>, it's all my fault.*/
@170 = ~It wasn't your fault, Linu. I'm not going to leave you.~
@171 = ~I won't leave you, Linu. You must be strong and go on, as Synth wanted you to.~
@172 = ~Quit whining Linu. He's been dead for a long time, get over it.~
@173 = ~Sweet <CHARNAME>, I know that with you by my side, anything is possible.~
@174 = ~I haven't let anything else get in the way, and this won't either. You don't need to remind me.~
@175 = ~NP: I... I wish I could believe... I don't know what to wish for. I just need time... But thank you for your words. You are a true friend, now it is certain. My heart will heal with time. I have to tell you something. Take this elven amulet. It can enhance some of your abilities, making them similar to those of those with elven blood.~ /*There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.*/
@176 = ~NP: I... I wish I could believe... I don't know what to wish for. I just need time... But thank you for your words. You are a true friend, now it is certain. My heart will heal with time. I have to tell you something. As our friendship grows, so will the power of the amulet I gave you. I think now you will find that he is stronger than before.~ /*As our friendship grows, so will the power of the pendant I gave you. I think that you shall find it is stronger now than it was before.*/
@177 = ~NP: ABOUT,<CHARNAME> How can you speak so cruelly? Don't you think that love is so easy to forget? But still, thanks to you, this diary was found. Actions speak louder than words. This is a more significant sign of friendship than any of your statements. As our friendship grows, so will the power of the amulet I gave you. I think now you will find that he is stronger than before.~ /*Still, you helped me find the journal. Deeds speak louder than words. I shall count this a truer sign of your friendship than your words.*/
@178 = ~NP: ABOUT,<CHARNAME> How can you speak so cruelly? Don't you think that love is so easy to forget? But still, thanks to you, this diary was found. Actions speak louder than words. This is a more significant sign of friendship than any of your statements. Take this elven amulet. It can enhance some of your abilities, making them similar to those of those with elven blood.~ /*There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.*/
@179 = ~NP: After he began to serenade me softly, I jumped up in bed and opened my mouth to scream. He jumped on me to cover my mouth, but I didn't know it was him and kicked him in the jaw. He was thrown back onto the balcony. I jumped forward to continue the attack, but when I jumped out onto the balcony, I saw his face in the moonlight. He held on to his jaw, his face wrinkled in pain.~ /*I leapt up to continue my attack, but when I got to the balcony, I saw his face in the moonlight. He was holding his jaw, his face wrinkled in pain.*/
@180 = ~You mean you broke his jaw?~
@181 = ~Remind me never to try to wake you quietly in the night.~
@182 = ~Well, it's not ten stories anymore. Not since the explosion, but that's a different story, and not one I want to get into.~
@183 = ~NP: I just gave him a bruise. But he must have been very sick, because when I realized what I had done, I moved closer to him, but he must have thought that I was throwing myself at him again. He rushed over the railing of the balcony, because he did not want to hurt me, stopping me, so he said later. I thought that he would fall and kill himself, and I rushed after him to stop him.~ /*I just bruised him. But it must have hurt a lot, because when I realized what I had done, I moved to help him and he must have thought I was attacking again.*/
@184 = ~Just whisper my name and I'll wake up fine. That's something I've had to train myself to do. Unfortunately it didn't help Synth.~
@185 = ~He had grabbed the edge of the balcony floor, between the rails, and was trying to swing himself toward the lower terrace. I didn't see his fingers though.~
@186 = ~Tell me you didn't.~
@187 = ~You're just one calamity after another, aren't you?~
@188 = ~NP: I stepped right on the fingers of his right hand and they slipped off the edge. Although he was able to stay on his left hand. Fearing for his life, I called on Sehanine for the strength to save him. I felt an influx of energy into my muscles, and reached the edge, grabbing his hand. I pulled, heard something burst with a loud crack, and pulled him over the railing, he had a dislocated shoulder and all that.~ /*Fearing he would die, I called on Sehanine for the strength to save him. I felt power flow into my muscles and I reached over the edge, grabbing his hand.*/
@189 = ~At least he survived.~
@190 = ~I'm afraid that's true. It wasn't my fault though, I was trying to help him.~
@191 = ~NP: I don't think he was genuinely grateful to me, at least not at first. He just lay on the balcony, trying to either hold his shoulder or rub his jaw. I tried to apologize, but he only begged me not to touch him. Finally, tired of his protests, I grabbed his shoulder, pulled him back, and cast a healing spell on him to ease the pain.~ /*I don't think he was terribly thankful at first. He just lay on the balcony, trying to hold his shoulder and rub his jaw. I was trying to apologize, but he just kept begging me not to touch him.*/
@192 = ~Did he forgive you?~
@193 = ~And that didn't kill him or turn him into a frog or something?~
@194 = ~I never gave him a chance to think about it. I helped him up, kissed him soundly, then led him into my bedchambers and removed any thought of flight from his mind.~
@195 = ~Good for you!~
@196 = ~You mean you... ?~
@197 = ~I may have troubles with certain things, but I am a good healer. You should know that by now.~
@198 = ~NP: We became very close after that night, and got married a year later. Those were the happiest years of my life. I would like them to go on and on.~ /*We were very close after that night and we married a year later. Those were the happiest years of my life.*/
@199 = ~What do you mean? What happened?~
@200 = ~What? Did you kill him finally?~
@201 = ~I'm sure you can fill in the details without my help.~
@202 = ~I... I can't talk about that right now. The memories are too unpleasant.~
@203 = ~That... that is a cruel thing to say. You have a heart like a rock. I have treated you as a friend; a lesson you should well learn.~
@204 = ~I suppose you won't rest until I tell you about the accident that led to my becoming a cleric of Sehanine. I guess I can tell you, though it was a horrifying experience.~
@205 = ~I want to hear it.~
@206 = ~NP: We'll speak another time.~ /*Me talk about different things.*/
@207 = ~NP: <CHARNAME>you are the most faithful friend in this world. I know that we must work together to complete all our tasks. I told you that I overheard a conversation between Sehanine Moonbow and a high cleric of her order. The words I heard will echo in my head for the rest of my days.~ /*I told you that I overheard Sehanine Moonbow speaking with the head cleric of her order. The words that I heard would echo in my mind for the rest of my life.*/
@208 = ~Tell me what they said.~
@209 = ~I've changed my mind. I don't really want to hear this.~
@210 = ~NP: That's all I could say my dear<CHARNAME> . I will protect your life at the cost of my own until Neverwinter is safe again. One day fate itself will lead me to the seed. The goddess brought me here to join you. With your help, I found the Moonbow Cup and my husband's diary. You are my guide on the way to the volcanic oak, to the restoration of my people.~ /*The goddess has led me to be here with you. With your help I have recovered the Chalice of Moonbow and found my husband's journal. You are my guide to restoring the volcanic oak, to rebuild my people.*/
@211 = ~Don't worry Linu, we will find the seed, somehow.~
@212 = ~No stupid seed had better get in the way of our important quest.~
@213 = ~We have too much to do right now to tell that tale. We need to find the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.~
@214 = ~NP: It's only been a month since we started our preparations when Gaedolin decided to introduce us to part of his collection of magical artifacts. He led us to his vault, to the part where the magic items of small power were located. We played with them for a while, but then I got bored.~ /*He took us into his vault, the part where the lower powered magic items were stored. We played with them for a while, but I was bored.*/
@215 = ~That's trouble.~
@216 = ~You didn't destroy the place, did you?~
@217 = ~You were bored playing with magic items?~
@218 = ~Bored children with magic items? I should say that's trouble.~
@219 = ~That's not funny. I didn't destroy anything... this time.~
@220 = ~NP: Since we came from families of wizards, most of us have already seen such items quite often. I couldn't be impressed with the wand of magic projectiles. I noticed that one of the doors was left ajar and quickly slipped inside. I wasn't going to touch anything, but two more students came after me and they were behind me. One of them asked me what I was doing.~ /*Being from a wizard's home, most of us had seen items like these quite a few times. I was hardly going to be impressed by a wand of magic missiles.*/
@221 = ~NP: His voice startled me and I jumped but didn't land on the floor. I did not notice the rope that was stretched to fence off the place where I flew. The hole I fell into was a door to another plane of reality, or at least I was told that later. As Gaedolin assured, no one, much less a child, could survive there.~ /*The hole I fell into was a doorway into another plane of existence, or at least that's what they told me later. According to Gaedolin, no person, let alone a child, should have survived the experience.*/
@222 = ~So how did you survive?~
@223 = ~I don't think anybody else could survive what you have.~
@224 = ~NP: All I remember is that my body expanded and contracted terribly rapidly, like a deep-breathing toad. This sensation seemed to last for hours, but it stopped after a few seconds. I can't explain better. When it was over, I opened my eyes.~ /*All I know is that my body seemed to expand and contract at a horribly fast rate, like a hyperventilating toad. The feeling seemed to last for hours, but was over in seconds.*/
@225 = ~What did you see?~
@226 = ~Does that make me blessed, or cursed?~
@227 = ~NP: I think it's a blessing. You are an exceptionally dangerous and most exciting woman.~ /*I think it's a blessing. You are the most dangerous, yet exciting woman I have ever met.*/
@228 = ~NP: Both, I think.~ /*No, no I'd say not.*/
@229 = ~Cursed.~
@230 = ~NP: There was a huge, grey, squelching creature that looked at me with twenty large eyes. I whimpered a little, I remember that. Then it started to move. I've probably never seen anything that can move so fast. I screamed as it lunged at me and continued to squeal until a bolt of bright blue light pierced its body, moments before it hit me.~ /*There was a large, gray, squishy thing that looked at me with twenty large eyes. I whimpered a little, I remember that. Then it started to move. I don't think I have ever seen anything move so very fast.*/
@231 = ~NP: I... I... yes, thank you. I don't know if I'm ready for a deeper relationship, but I appreciate your kind opinion.~ /*<CHARNAME>! I... I... well, thank you. I don't know if I'm ready for a deeper relationship, but I value your good opinion.*/
@232 = ~Then let's continue your story.~
@233 = ~Then I don't want to listen to your whiny stories anymore.~
@234 = ~Woah! Deeper relationship? It was just a compliment.~
@235 = ~NP: Yes... I think so. All I remember is that my body expanded and contracted terribly rapidly, like a deep-breathing toad. This sensation seemed to last for hours, but it stopped after a few seconds. I can't explain better. When it was over, I opened my eyes.~ /*All I know is that my body seemed to expand and contract at a horribly fast rate, like a hyperventilating toad. The feeling seemed to last for hours, but was over in seconds.*/
@236 = ~I sat on the ground, trembling uncontrollably. Arms enveloped my quaking form and a soft voice whispered words into my ear.~
@237 = ~What did the voice say?~
@238 = ~Who was it?~
@239 = ~Is that all this is? Is this just a way to get me into your bed? You swine!~
@240 = ~I was just joking, Linu. Calm yourself and continue your story.~
@241 = ~I really don't care what you think. Let's get going.~
@242 = ~Oh... I'm sorry <CHARNAME>. I thought you meant... (sigh) it was a nice gesture. Sorry I ruined it. I'll continue my story now.~
@243 = ~NP: I can recall images of travel and rest, life and death, and future times. While the voice was speaking, I felt very tired and fell into a dream. When I woke up, I was lying in a soft bed, surrounded by a canopy hanging from the ceiling, and I heard a quiet conversation between a man and a woman from behind the canopy.~ /*I can only recall images of journeys and safety, of life and death and of times to come. As the voice spoke, I began to feel very tired and I drifted off to sleep.*/
@244 = ~That would be getting ahead of the story. Just be patient.~
@245 = ~I don't find that kind of humor to be very funny.~
@246 = ~At your command, verithalas!~
@247 = ~The voices were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of my master, who angrily asked why I was taken to the temple of Sehanine. A single word from the woman stopped him cold.~
@248 = ~How did she stop him?~
@249 = ~What did she say?~
@250 = ~NP: All she said was his name. He looked at her with a spiky look, then his eyes went wide and he fell to his knees. I was embarrassed, not understanding who was standing next to my bed. And all my teacher said was her name: Sehanine.~ /*All she said was his name. He looked at her with a piercing stare, then his eyes opened in surprise and he sank to his knees. I was confused, having no idea who was standing by my bed.*/
@251 = ~Wait, you were rescued by a goddess?~
@252 = ~I already figured that out.~
@253 = ~NP: The goddess approached and pushed back the curtain. She smiled and kissed my forehead. &quot;My child,&quot; she said, &quot;you have overstepped the bounds of luck.&quot; Green light enveloped her body, she stepped back and disappeared. But even years later, acquaintances treated me with trepidation and called me &quot;child of the goddess.&quot; Sehanine did me a favor, but there were days when I dreamed that she would make him more inconspicuous.~ /*A green light surrounded her body as she stepped back and disappeared. For years after that experience, people treated me with awe and called me the god-child.*/
@254 = ~That does seem to stretch the limits of luck.~
@255 = ~How could you be ungrateful for such a gift?~
@256 = ~Yes dear, you're very smart.~
@257 = ~Such is my life. Bad and good luck in heaping amounts, like a gift of gold that crushes you under its weight.~
@258 = ~I have dedicated my life to the goddess. She gave me that gift, so I gave everything back to her. There is a task that she wishes me to accomplish and that is why she chose to save my life.~
@259 = ~A task?~
@260 = ~NP: I overheard part of her conversation with the high priest before my master entered the room. But this is a task for me, and should not interfere with your goals. We have too much to do right now to tell this story. We need to find the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.~ /*We have too much to do right now to tell that tale. We need to find the Words of Power for Aarin Gend if we are to save Neverwinter.*/
@261 = ~NP: She told the old priest that in her travels in this world she had come across a forest of fantastic oaks growing in the middle of a ridge of fire-breathing volcanoes. As she stood in thought, spellbound by the beauty of the oaks, the volcanoes erupted. Lava flows rushed down the mountains, burning all life in their path.~ /*She told the elderly cleric that during her wanderings through this world, she had come upon a forest of breathtaking oak trees that grew in the middle of a range of volcanoes.*/
@262 = ~The way I could stand and admire your beauty for endless hours.~
@263 = ~How long did she stand there looking at the trees?~
@264 = ~All right dear. Maybe later.~
@265 = ~Oh... now that's the kind of comment that could trip up a woman's heart. But... let's explore that later.~
@266 = ~NP: Lava reached the edge of the forest and destroyed every single tree. A distressed Sehanine, ready to move on, noticed something strange. Tree seeds floated in the lava flow.~ /*This saddened Sehanine, but as she prepared to move away, she noticed something very unusual. The seeds of the tree were floating on top of the lava.*/
@267 = ~Floating?~
@268 = ~Are you sure you weren't still dreaming?~
@269 = ~Being an elven goddess, probably several years or more.~
@270 = ~NP: They didn't burn. As the lava cooled, the seeds sprouted and small shoots appeared, taking root in the newly created infertile soil. In a few weeks the forest grew again, and proud trees stood in contradiction to the realm of volcanoes that stretched all around and their eternal destruction.~ /*Within weeks the forest had renewed itself and the oak trees stood tall, defiant of the surrounding volcanoes and their fiery destruction.*/
@271 = ~That's amazing.~
@272 = ~Beauty standing amidst fiery destruction. That's you!~
@273 = ~I'm positive. Just hear me out.~
@274 = ~NP: Sehanine was so impressed by the regality of these trees that she made her favorite weapon out of one of the branches. Sehanin left this forest, but occasionally returned there to enjoy the grandeur of their beauty. But one day she returned and found that the trees had disappeared, leaving not a single seed. The goddess was crying.~ /*Sehanine left the forest, returning occasionally to enjoy the splendor of their beauty. One day she returned to find that the trees had disappeared. Not a single seed remained, which made her weep.*/
@275 = ~What happened to them?~
@276 = ~People die every day, but this goddess cries over a tree?~
@277 = ~NP: What do you mean? Oh... I think I understand. I think you should be thanked. I like this image. It gives me confidence that I have a greater purpose in life. You managed to hit me<CHARNAME> . This is what I appreciate in men.~ /*Thank you, I think. That's an image I like. I guess it just makes me feel like I have a little more purpose in life. You surprise me <CHARNAME>. I like that in a man.*/
@278 = ~NP: Sehanine didn't know what had happened. She was absent for several centuries, and not a trace of the mighty volcanic oaks remained. Now, honey, that's my assignment. Sehanin thinks that perhaps one day an elven priestess will bring a volcanic oak seed to Evereska as a symbol of the rebirth of the elf people.~ /*This is my task, dear one. Sehanine thinks it is possible that one day an elf priestess will find a seed of the volcanic oak and bring it to Evereska to be a symbol of rebirth for the elven people.*/
@279 = ~She would weep if all of her people died, and she does sometimes weep when a favored elf is killed. But this was a symbol of nobility and strength.~
@280 = ~With this symbol, as the oak is reborn through fiery death, our people might be rekindled in spirit, though we might face adversity. I must find this seed, though I know not where one might exist.~
@281 = ~NP: Yes - this is exactly the seed that the goddess described to me, there is no doubt. ABOUT,<CHARNAME> and that's all for me! There is nothing I can give you that balances your gift to the people of Evereska. You've managed to establish yourself as one of the best friends of the elf people.~ /*There is nothing I could give you that could equal the gift you have given to the people of Evereska. You have proven that you are the best of friends to the elven people.*/
@282 = ~NP: Thank you,<CHARNAME> . Your words are dear to my heart. I have not had such a close friend since the death of my husband. You managed to fill a void that I thought would be forever. But for now, we must focus on finding the Words of Power. Aarin Gend is counting on us.~ /*Thank you, my <CHARNAME>. Your words are dear to my heart. I have had no close companion since my husband's death. You fill a void that I thought would be empty forever.*/
@283 = ~Your father was an abusive bastard wasn't he? I shall imagine that he was so that I can continue to serve someone whose heart is so cold.~
@284 = ~I think you shall find that the pendant I gave you is now much stronger than before.~
@285 = ~NP: Take this elven amulet. It can enhance some of your abilities, making them similar to those of those with elven blood.~ /*There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.*/
@286 = ~Dear <CHARNAME>, I would like to talk to you for a moment.~ [LINA050]
@287 = ~Yes Linu, what did you want to talk about?~
@288 = ~I'm too busy right now, Linu.~
@289 = ~NP: A fierce battle awaits us, in which we can lose our lives,<CHARNAME> . I feel like I have something to share with you. This upcoming fight with Morag scares me terribly. I never thought that I would ever be able to participate in this, although I have been waiting for this for some time.~ /*This battle that we face with Morag frightens me desperately. I didn't think I would ever be able to face this day, though I have known it would come for some time now.*/
@290 = ~Of... of course you are. It was foolish of me to interrupt you; I had just wanted to share something with you, but it is of no matter.~
@291 = ~*Sigh* All right. What did you want to say?~
@292 = ~I have no time for your chatter. Let's go.~
@293 = ~Yet now that the time has come at last, I find that I have mastered my fear, and it is all because of you. I have drawn courage from following the greatest hero of our time - <CHARNAME>.~
@294 = ~We have been a team, Linu. You too are a hero.~
@295 = ~That's the job of a hero. We inspire others to greatness.~
@296 = ~What ever. Let's just get going, okay?~
@297 = ~NP: In that case, we will meet our fate together. Now let's show them what a legend means and kick some ass!~ /*Now let's go show them what legends are made of and kick some scaly-ass!*/
@298 = ~NP: Thanks for the compliment, but if it wasn't for you, I'd still be trapped or dead in plague-ridden Neverwinter. Or maybe I could burn down the whole city. Words cannot express how many nightmares I had about the upcoming fight. Then I slip on the blood and knock you into a deep abyss.~ /*That's if I hadn't managed to burn the entire city down around me. I can't tell you the number of nightmares I've had about this coming battle, where I would slip in some blood and knock you into a huge chasm.*/
@299 = ~NP: Well, I couldn't do without inspiration. If it weren't for you, I would still be trapped or would have died in the plague-ridden Neverwinter. Or maybe I could burn down the whole city. Words cannot express how many nightmares I had about the upcoming fight. Then I slip on the blood and knock you into a deep abyss.~ /*That's if I hadn't managed to burn the entire city down around me. I can't tell you the number of nightmares I've had about this coming battle, where I would slip in some blood and knock you into a huge chasm.*/
@300 = ~NP: Fine,<CHARNAME> . I won't waste your time with my boring thoughts. Now let's show them what a legend means and kick some ass!~ /*Now let's go show them what legends are made of and kick some scaly-ass!*/
@301 = ~Or I would start to cast a healing spell and it would go wrong and you'd be turned inside out. Or you would be just about to kill Morag and I'd lean against a giant boulder that would fall over and crush you.~
@302 = ~NP: Maybe it's just your lack of self-confidence.~ /*Maybe you're just weaker than you thought.*/
@303 = ~Okay Linu, I get the point.~
@304 = ~NP: Your confidence and your skills taught me a good lesson. And I really believe that no matter what happens next, I am better and stronger than I was before we met you. Now I know that I can have the nobility and refinement of my elven ancestors. I just need to believe in my strength. It's a lesson I couldn't have learned without your help<CHARNAME> .~ /*I have learned from your confidence and skill, and I truly believe that, no matter what happens next, I am a stronger, better person than I was when we first met.*/
@305 = ~Enough speeches, we need to get going now.~
@306 = ~Now let's go show them what legends are made of and kick some scaly-ass!~
@307 = ~NP: I can't help but agree. Now let's show them what a legend means and kick some ass!~ /*Now let's go show them what legends are made of and kick some scaly-ass!*/
