@0 = ~I bid you welcome, dwarf, for I see you are not of the clan that hunts us and destroys our trees. I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads.~ [NWARW055]
@1 = ~For what reason have you sought me out, <RACE> one? Is there some boon you would ask of me?~ 
@2 = ~Why are the dwarves at war with you?~ 
@3 = ~What do you make of this amulet?~
@4 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@5 = ~All right, dryad. Now it's your turn to die.~
@6 = ~I think I will go now. Farewell.~
@7 = ~The dwarves cannot be reasoned with. They slaughter my sisters and chop down our trees. It is as if they are possessed by a kind of madness. And yet sometimes I feel the dwarves are not solely to blame. I do not speak of this with my sisters, but there are times when... things are not clear, as if I am in a dream or nightmare.~ 
@8 = ~This amulet looks... familiar. As if I knew it once long, long ago. See the inscription on the back? It is written in an old and ancient tongue... yet I know what the words say: "Tree and forge united, to overthrow the Master."~ 
@9 = ~As you wish, <RACE> <MALEFEMALE>. What wisdom I have I shall gladly share with you, though I know little beyond our endless war with the immortal dwarves.~
@10 = ~Immortal? What are you talking about?~
@11 = ~What is this place? How can this world exist inside a snow globe?~
@12 = ~We battle the dwarves each and every day, and it has made us strong with courage. We shall not fly from another fight!~
@13 = ~May the earth be ever soft beneath your feet. But travel with care, good <MANWOMAN>. Danger is ever present.~
@14 = ~I have dark visions of me and my sisters unleashing our magic on the dwarves and revelling in the slaughter. I cannot help but wonder if we dryads do not sometimes succumb to the same bloodlust as our foe.~
@15 = ~Have you always been at war with the dwarves?~ 
@16 = ~I can sense that once this amulet held great magic. The power of nature itself was contained within. But it is cracked, and the magic within it is gone.~
@17 = ~Can you do anything to fix it?~
@18 = ~I sense that this amulet once held great power. The magic of nature itself was contained within. But the magic is now gone, the amulet is cold within my hand.~
@19 = ~Can you make it magic?~
@20 = ~This amulet conjures strange visions in my mind: half-remembered images of a time long ago, when dryad and dwarf alike served a terrible, cruel Master.~
@21 = ~Tell me more about this vision.~
@22 = ~The true horror of this war is that it can never, ever end. The dwarves we slay are reborn and venture forth to wage war upon us again, just as we are reborn after each and every death. A thousand, thousand times I have felt the cold steel of a dwarven sword pierce my flesh, or had my skull broken by their great war hammers. Yet each time I reappear whole again in this grove.~
@23 = ~That's horrible!~
@24 = ~You are immortal! You get to live forever.~
@25 = ~Forgive me but I do not understand your question. I know nothing of this snow globe of which you speak, and our world is as it is. We know no other life but this one of constant, endless war with the dwarves.~ 
@26 = ~I... I think not, though it is hard to remember anything else. But within my mind there are fleeting images of a time long, long ago. A time when dwarf and dryad stood side by side. We were slaves to a terrible master, a monstrous creature of pure evil. Dwarf and nymph alike served this being, and together we dared stand against it.~ 
@27 = ~Perhaps I could imbue it with the magic of tree and earth, if it were whole. But the amulet is cracked. It must be repaired before I can fill it with magic. However, metallurgy is beyond the skill of I or my sisters. The dwarves may possess such power, but they will surely attack you on sight if you try to reason with them. I am sorry I can tell you no more of this amulet.~
@28 = ~Perhaps... yes, it is possible for me to restore the magic of tree and earth to this amulet. Prepare yourself. It... it is done. The amulet... is whole again.~ 
@29 = ~Are you okay? Is something wrong?~
@30 = ~I see a... creature. Cold as death. The Master. And I see... it is unclear... I see... the amulet. Yes, the Amulet of Ages! Forged to slay the Master and free us from this existence. I remember! We set out against the Master, dwarves and dryads together and... no, the memory is fading... the Master was too strong... the amulet cracked, its magic was lost and... and...~ 
@31 = ~Our life is one of endless suffering and hate. We feel the pain of death and the horrors of eternal war, but for us there can be no escape. I know not how we came to be this way, though I know our existence is... wrong. But we know no other life. War, death, rebirth... the cycle shall never end.~
@32 = ~But the memories are clouded and unclear, a trembling reflection in a muddied pond. Perhaps they are not even real, for it seems as if our war with the dwarves has raged since the dawn of existence.~
@33 = ~I'm sorry, the vision is gone. It... it as if some great spell has stripped the memories from my mind. I can tell you nothing more about the amulet or the Master we once served. I'm sorry.~
@34 = ~Maybe I could free you from this Master.~
@35 = ~The only release we seek is death. Perhaps, if you could slay the Master we could find peace... but it may be the Master is already dead. Even now I cannot remember... The magic is too strong. I am sorry, but the memories jarred by the amulet are gone. I cannot even recall the face of the Master. I can tell you no more.~ 
@36 = ~I am Arwyl, leader of the dryads. I bid you welcome, <RACE> one. Your kind is strange to us - we are used to seeing only the dwarves who attack us on sight.~ [NWARW056] 
@37 = ~I bid you welcome once again, <RACE> friend.~ [NWARW054]
