@0 = ~What can an old farmer do for you, m'<LADYLORD>?~
@1 = ~What's your name?~
@2 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@3 = ~I need some directions.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Me? I'm Farmer O'Deel but you can just call me Pete, if you like. An' who might you be?~
@6 = ~You may call me <CHARNAME>.~
@7 = ~NP: No matter what my name is, our squad is led by <CHARNAME>.~ /*Who are you? My name is <CHARNAME>.*/
@8 = ~Sorry, I generally don't give out my name.~
@9 = ~Sorry, I have to keep an eye on my cattle. No time for distractions.~
@10 = ~How many cattle do you have?~
@11 = ~Yes, on your way, then. Well met.~ /*Yes, on your way, then.*/
@12 = ~Very well. <CHARNAME> it is, then. I've been having some trouble around the farm as of late... Think you'd be fit to help out?~
@13 = ~What troubles you tell of?~
@14 = ~This does not interest me. Goodbye.~ /*I'm not interested. Goodbye.*/
@15 = ~As you wish. I've been having some trouble around the farm as of late, m'<LADYLORD>... Think you'd be of a mind to help me out?~
@16 = ~Less than I had a few weeks ago, admittedly. The herd's run into some bad trouble, lately.~
@17 = ~There are some dire wolves in the hills there that have taken to preying on my herd. The pack's led by a big she-wolf I've taken to calling Silverback... I swear I'll pay 300 gold to have her head. She's already taken down two of my cattle and, left to her own devices, she'll clear the whole herd.~ /*I swear I'll pay 300 gold to have her head. She's already taken down two of my cattle and, left to her own devices, she'll clear the whole herd.*/
@18 = ~Sure, that sounds like something I could do.~
@19 = ~Sorry, it doesn't sound like high adventure...~
@20 = ~NP: Actually, that she-wolf is already dead.~ /*Baram is already dead, actually.*/
@21 = ~Well I didn't kill Silverback but I did speak with her...~
@22 = ~NP: I want to know the details.~ /*Me want ask questions.*/
@23 = ~NP: Really? Well, I'll only breathe easy when the damn wolf is dead, but thanks for your help. In the meantime, is there anything else you need?~ /*That be true? Well I won't hold my breath 'til I see you returning with ol' Silverback's head but the help's appreciated. Until then, need anything else?*/
@24 = ~Where do I find these wolves again?~
@25 = ~Mind if I ask you a few more questions?~
@26 = ~I'll be back after I find the wolf.~
@27 = ~NP: No. I find this case too much of a hassle.~ /*No. It still seems like too much trouble.*/
@28 = ~NP: That's what I thought. Well, if you'll excuse me, I have a herd to tend to.~ /*I reckoned as much. If you'll excuse me, then, m'<LADYLORD>, I've got a herd to watch over.*/
@29 = ~NP: Oh, my gods, <MALEFEMALE> you did it! Wow! That must have been hard! Well, now. I guess a reward of 500 gold pieces will be enough, huh?~ /*By the gods, <MANWOMAN>, so you do! Bravo! I imagine that could not have been a simple task!*/
@30 = ~That'll do, Pete. That'll do.~
@31 = ~I think I've earned a higher reward than that.~
@32 = ~More money, fool, or I'll have your head, too!~
@33 = ~No reward necessary. The joy of the hunt was reward enough.~
@34 = ~You what!? Bah, who am I to argue. I've been known to talk to my cows on occasion... Still, wolves are predators. What makes you think they'll stop?~
@35 = ~She gave me her word. She'll stick to it.~
@36 = ~NP: Well, then I'll go and kill her...~ /*Well, I'll be off now. Farewell.*/
@37 = ~Find someone else, then, because I'm not killing her...~
@38 = ~Sure thing. What do you want to know?~
@39 = ~Where can I find these wolves?~
@40 = ~NP: That's not a lot of money for a job like this.~ /*There is something not quite right about this child.*/
@41 = ~What kind of threat do these wolves pose?~
@42 = ~NP: The entrance to the cave is just south of my farm. That's where they have their lair. Anything else? Or are you going to finish off the wolves like you promised?~ /*Now, is there anything else? Or are you going to bring me the head as you promised?*/
@43 = ~NP: I'm not really in the mood to talk. I have to protect my herd from wolves. Well, is there anything else? Or are you going to finish off the wolves like you promised?~ /*I'm not really in the mood for questions. I've still got to protect my cattle from the wolves.*/
@44 = ~NP: That's good to hear. Come back when the she-wolf is dead, and I'll pay your reward promptly.~ /*That's good to hear. Return when you have the head and I'll give you your reward.*/
@45 = ~As you wish, <SIRMAAM>, though it's a shame you don't have the heart to help a simple dairy farmer.~
@46 = ~Thanks for the help, then. With the she-wolf gone, the rest of the pack should be easy enough to scatter. It's been appreciated. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again, m'<LADYLORD>.~ /*Thanks for the help, then. With the she-wolf gone, the rest of the pack should be easy enough to scatter. It's been appreciated.*/
@47 = ~NP: You can't get much for wolf pelts, though. Here's 675 gold pieces, that's all I have. And the herd won't recover for a few years.~ /*True, maybe the pelts aren't worth as much as I led you to believe. Here, 375 gold is all I have. The herd'll recover in a few years.*/
@48 = ~NP: The wolf skins may be heavy, but you can get good money for them in town. I can't give you more than 500 gold pieces. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to Port Llast for more cows. Thank you again.~ /*The wolf pelts may be heavy but they'll be worth gold enough when you make it back to town. 300 gold was what we agreed on at the start.*/
@49 = ~NP: You're gonna take a man's life so easily? You've had enough of your loot, demon, and the 500 gold I promised you-- Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go to Port Llast for more cows.~ /*Would you toss away a man's life so easily? Satisfy yourself with your loot, fiend, and the 300 gold I promised you...*/
@50 = ~Then you are more than kind, m'<LADYLORD>. If only there were more such as you, a farm like this could maybe still turn a profit. Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again, m'<LADYLORD>.~ /*Then you are more than kind, m'<LADYLORD>. If only there were more such as you, a farm like this could maybe still turn a profit.*/
@51 = ~Very well, then. It may be against my better judgment but I suppose I trust you... I assume the 300 gold we discussed is sufficient?~
@52 = ~NP: No, I don't trust her, and neither do you! As long as Silverback is alive, you won't get any money from me.~ /*Well I don't trust her and I don't trust you, either, <SIRMAAM>!*/
@53 = ~NP: Their lair is in a cave south of my farm. There's always a couple of them wandering around.~ /*They den in a cave just past the waterfalls where my cattle like to drink. There are always a couple of them pacing in front.*/
@54 = ~All right, that's enough information to make a decision on.~
@55 = ~NP: Maybe so, but I'm not a rich man. You can't make much money from cattle nowadays, especially when the wolves don't let you live.... Well, those wolves are pretty good, if that's any consolation. And, after all, their hides will be worth money in the city too....~ /*Perhaps so but I'm not a wealthy man. There's not much money in cattle these days, and less when you're losing your herd to wolves...*/
@56 = ~NP: These aren't ordinary wolves. Fierce wolves are more cunning and stronger than ordinary wolves. At least they're more intelligent than old Ingo's boy....~ /*Well I'll warn you now, they aren't your everyday timber wolves. Dire wolves are a lot tougher and a lot more cunning. Smarter than old Ingo's boy at any rate...*/
@57 = ~You'll help? You'll kill Silverback and her pack?~
@58 = ~Aye? Something amiss, traveler?~
@59 = ~NP: Ah, you're back! So, any good news? Did you kill that she-wolf, Silverback?~ /*So you have returned, m'<LADYLORD>! Have you good news? Have you the head of the she-wolf, Silverback?*/
@60 = ~NP: Oh, I'll go and tell my landlady. And I have to go to Port Llast for more cows. Thank you again.~ /*Now, if you'll excuse me, I've got to make a trip to Port Llast to restock the herd. Thank you again, m'<LADYLORD>.*/
