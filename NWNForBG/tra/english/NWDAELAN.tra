@0 = ~Greetings, <SIRMAAM>. I see you are not yet infected by the plague that ravages Neverwinter. Among such suffering and misery we who are not yet afflicted must be grateful for our health.~ [NWDAEL51]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~NP: Now I don't have time to talk. Goodbye.~ /*I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.*/
@3 = ~I am Daelan Red Tiger of the Uthgardt tribes of the frozen North. But it has been over a year since I left my people and came to Neverwinter. Now I earn my living as a blade for hire.~
@4 = ~You're quite well spoken for a half-orc.~
@5 = ~I'm sorry, but I don't know much about the Uthgardt tribes.~
@6 = ~Why would an Uthgardt tribesman come to the city?~
@7 = ~I'm looking for a good mercenary to help me in my mission.~
@8 = ~As you wish, <SIRMAAM>. Come back if you ever wish to hire a warrior of great skill and honor.~
@9 = ~My father was an orc, and the blood of his inhuman race is in my veins. But I was raised by my mother among the tribes of the Uthgardt.~
@10 = ~There are some in the city who call my people savages and barbarians, but they know nothing of the Uthgardt. We are great warriors and hunters, following the herds and living off the land.~
@11 = ~Many of my people's customs would be familiar to you, <CHARNAME>. We too are called barbarians, for we are tribal hunters and warriors who live off the land.~
@12 = ~My tribe is noble, but small. Among them there was little chance for a young warrior to prove himself or earn a wife. But I am young and strong and my people are renowned for their skill in battle. Here in Neverwinter I found work on the docks as a guard for the cargo and shipments being transported.~ /*But I am young and strong and my people are renowned for their skill in battle. Here in Neverwinter I found work on the docks as a guard for the cargo and shipments being transported.*/
@13 = ~Then what happened?~
@14 = ~I am no stranger to battle or bloodshed, but I am a warrior with honor. I will not undertake any sinister mission. Had I desired such work I could have found employment back at the docks.~
@15 = ~NP: I work for Aribeth. I've been tasked with finding the missing creatures that will serve as ingredients for a cure for the plague.~ /*I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that are ingredients for a plague cure.*/
@16 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@17 = ~The coming of the plague changed everything. The quarantine halted all incoming or outgoing ships. There was no work and no money. I should have left the docks then. Many of the dock workers were afflicted - men I had come to know as friends. I stayed to ease their suffering, but in the end I could do nothing to save them from the Wailing Death.~ /*Many of the dock workers were afflicted - men I had come to know as friends. I stayed to ease their suffering, but in the end I could do nothing to save them from the Wailing Death.*/
@18 = ~Aribeth's reputation is well known throughout the city, so I have no fear your mission will bring dishonor to me. I will work for you, if we can agree upon a fair price for my services. I am not one to boast of my own abilities, yet the skill and ferocity of the Uthgardt tribes are well known throughout the North.~ /*Aribeth's reputation is well known throughout the city, so I have no fear your mission will bring dishonor to me. I will work for you, if we can agree upon a fair price for my services.*/
@19 = ~I can understand that. If you are working for Aribeth then I am certain your 'mission' must be of great importance.~
@20 = ~With my friends dead there was no reason to stay in the docks. Not with things getting... worse. Now I earn a living with my axe as a freelance mercenary.~
@21 = ~What did you mean about the docks getting 'worse'?~
@22 = ~I doubt you will find any other axeman for hire who is my equal. Only 250 gold pieces and I am your willing servant.~
@23 = ~I could use a good fighter. Here's your 150 gold. Welcome aboard, Daelan.~
@24 = ~That seems a little expensive. I'll give you 100.~
@25 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@26 = ~Goodbye.~
@27 = ~NP: You won't regret it. My powers are at your disposal. I will follow you and do my best; according to your orders.~ /*I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.*/
@28 = ~NP: Working for you is an honor. Let it be 600, and all my abilities are at your disposal. I will follow you and do my best; according to your orders.~ /*You seem like an honorable <MANWOMAN> to work for. 100 it is, and all my skills are yours to command.*/
@29 = ~I'm sorry, 150 is my final offer. If you do not wish to hire me I'm certain others shall.~
@30 = ~NP: Unfortunately, I have to make a living from my art. I can't work for free.~ /*That is unfortunate, but I must earn a living through my skills. I cannot work for free. Is there something else you need?*/
@31 = ~The quarantine trapped ships in port, swelling the number of pirates and other criminals in the district - men with no honor. And with the city guard focused on the plague, these evil men have seized control of the docks. An Uthgardt warrior knows no fear, but I will not dishonor my tribe. I refuse to serve these men! I will not become a common thug or murderer!~ /*The quarantine trapped ships in port, swelling the number of pirates and other criminals in the district - men with no honor. And with the city guard focused on the plague, these evil men have seized control of the docks.*/
@32 = ~Anything else you can tell me about the docks?~
@33 = ~Before I left I heard talk in the district of an auction to be held at Jim Seedy's tavern. Something besides the usual stolen merchandise, illegal goods and helpless slaves sold at his filthy den of sin. The word spread quickly on the street. Perhaps I could have learned more before I left, but I had no interest in such transactions. I am a warrior, not a smuggler.~ /*Before I left I heard talk in the district of an auction to be held at Jim Seedy's tavern. Something besides the usual stolen merchandise, illegal goods and helpless slaves sold at his filthy den of sin.*/
@34 = ~There is little else I can tell you about the docks, but I know the district is dangerous. If you intend to go there you would be wise to take along a hired blade.~
@35 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some hired help to assist me on my mission.~
@36 = ~No thanks. Goodbye.~
@37 = ~I see you have returned, <SIRMAAM>. What brings you back to the Trade of Blades?~ [NWDAEL52]
@38 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@39 = ~There is little I can tell you about the city. Since the plague I have spent most of my days here seeking employment. I do have some knowledge of the docks district, as I worked there before the plague. It was a dangerous and sinister place when I left... though I suspect things have only grown worse since then.~ /*I do have some knowledge of the docks district, as I worked there before the plague. It was a dangerous and sinister place when I left... though I suspect things have only grown worse since then.*/
@40 = ~<CHARNAME>! It is a pleasure to see you again, though not altogether unexpected. I had heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the foul cult that was responsible for the plague.~ [NWDAEL53]
@41 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Daelan.~
@42 = ~You again? Are you following me like some kind of pathetic lost puppy?~
@43 = ~I know we went our separate ways, <CHARNAME>, but it seems the gods have seen fit to bring us together once more. After we parted ways in Neverwinter, I returned to the Trade of Blades to offer my skills for hire. It was there I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ /*After we parted ways in Neverwinter, I returned to the Trade of Blades to offer my skills for hire. It was there I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.*/
@44 = ~I am grateful for all you have done for me, <CHARNAME>, but I did not follow you here. Make no mistake, Daelan Red Tiger is his own man.~
@45 = ~Farewell, <SIRMAAM>. My blade is at your service if you require the aid of a skilled and honorable warrior.~
@46 = ~It seems Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search.~
@47 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@48 = ~NP: How much will it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@49 = ~When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists. Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?~ /*When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.*/
@50 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@51 = ~I could use a good fighter by my side.~
@52 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@53 = ~I have heard nothing of the cult, though many suspect - as I do - that answers might be found in the city of Luskan.~
@54 = ~Luskan?~
@55 = ~NP: What is this city?~ /*What kind of guild is this?*/
@56 = ~I would be honored to join my blade to your cause.~
@57 = ~Then I shall bid you farewell. If you ever find yourself in need of a skilled and honorable warrior come speak to me again.~
@58 = ~That city has long been an enemy of Neverwinter. An evil blight upon the North, it is widely acknowledged as the home of murders and thieves - a place with no honor! It would not surprise me to discover links to the cult in that den of evil. Is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ /*That city has long been an enemy of Neverwinter. An evil blight upon the North, it is widely acknowledged as the home of murders and thieves - a place with no honor!*/
@59 = ~Greetings once more, <SIRMAAM>. It is I, Daelan Red Tiger, warrior of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. Remember? I am eager to have my revenge on the cult that loosed its plague on Neverwinter.~ [NWDAEL55] /*Greetings once more, <SIRMAAM>. It is I, Daelan Red Tiger, warrior of the Uthgardt Red Tiger tribe. Remember?*/
@60 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@61 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@62 = ~If you're so interested in vengeance, why are you standing around here?~
@63 = ~It seems Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search. I answered the call without hesitation. I lost many friends to the plague and I am eager to avenge their deaths. The cowards who unleashed this curse must be made to pay.~ /*It seems Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search.*/
@64 = ~I would accomplish little by dashing off on my own. My orders were to come here and help any who might need my blade. Your reputation is well known, <CHARNAME>. I am no great hero such as you, but I am a skilled warrior of the Red Tiger tribe. My people are well known for their bravery, honor, and ferocity in battle. I could be of great service to you in seeking out this cult, if you would have me.~ /*I would accomplish little by dashing off on my own. My orders were to come here and help any who might need my blade.*/
@65 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra fighter. You're in.~
@66 = ~NP: Of course I bow to your will<CHARNAME> . I am honored to serve the cause of such a great hero. I will follow you and follow your orders to the best of my ability.~ /*Of course I will bow to your lead, <CHARNAME>. I am honored to join my blade to the cause of such a great hero.*/
@67 = ~If you find yourself in need of a strong warrior to aid you, come back and speak to me. My blade is ready to aid you in this mission.~
@68 = ~Greetings and well met. You are <CHARNAME>, aren't you? The one responsible for saving the city of Neverwinter. Your deeds have become something of a legend.~ [NWDAEL54]
@69 = ~NP: Well, this is not only my merit. Aribeth and the other city guards did no less.~ /*Well, I wasn't acting alone. Aribeth and the other city guard did as much as I.*/
@70 = ~Yes, that would be me.~
@71 = ~Your are modest to share the praise, though it does nothing to diminish the honor you have rightly earned.~
@72 = ~I am Daelan Red Tiger, a noble warrior from the Uthgardt tribes of the north. No doubt your mission here is the same as mine: to aid Aribeth in stamping out the cult that was responsible for the Wailing Death.~
