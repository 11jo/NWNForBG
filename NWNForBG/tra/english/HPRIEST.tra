@0 = ~Speak what ye will, friend. I will answer.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I will answer, though I am a newcomer too. Granting blessings in this time of plague has not left much time for exploration.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Have you collected a lot of charitable donations?~
@8 = ~As you will. Would you like a blessing as you go?~
@9 = ~Please. I'm sure it will help.~
@10 = ~No, thanks.~
@11 = ~You keep your useless blessing thing!~
@12 = ~Hmm... I have only just acquainted myself with the city, but I will assist you if I can.~
@13 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@14 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@15 = ~The Wailing pulls at the soul, spiritually tearing a victim apart from within. The blessings I give are small comfort, but comfort nonetheless.~
@16 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@17 = ~MT: There is another question.~ /*I want to ask something else.*/
@18 = ~MT: Actually, no. I care more about plague patients than petty scandals. Don't waste your time on empty guesses. You should think more about your state of mind.~ /*Don't waste your time following conjecture. You should be more concerned about your spiritual well-being.*/
@19 = ~I have... acquired some measure of gold from the generous. What business do you have asking me about it?~
@20 = ~You give me gold or I'll kill you and claim you were stealing it!~
@21 = ~I was merely curious. Let's go back to some other questions.~
@22 = ~No, I have nothing. Someone else has already bilked me of anything I might have had, so you may as well just ask your questions and leave.~
@23 = ~MT: The city is divided into several districts. This division holds back the plague a little, but also alienates people from each other. I think the districts are called Beggar's Nest, Harbor, Black Lake, Peninsula and Heart of the City.~ /*There are several districts dividing the city. The division has apparently slowed the plague, but it divides people as well.*/
@24 = ~Talk about the City Core.~
@25 = ~Talk about the Beggar's Nest.~
@26 = ~Talk about the Docks district.~
@27 = ~Talk about the Blacklake district.~
@28 = ~Talk about the Peninsula.~
@29 = ~I know little of these things. I need only my blessings. Still, I believe there are a few establishments that have what you want.~
@30 = ~The blessings of we Helmites upon you. May it deliver you beyond the plague.~
@31 = ~MT: Most of them are just stupid sorcery, and none of these remedies will produce any results. We Helmites serve Dester, and only our blessings will save Neverwinter. At first people refuse, but the more they get sick with the plague, the less they use such things and accept what we offer.~ /*Most are foolish sorcery, and none have proven effective. We Helmites under Desther are certain that only our blessings will deliver Neverwinter.*/
@32 = ~Don't you want the other cure attempts to work?~
@33 = ~MT: Everyone wants the plague to end. We, led by Dester, firmly believe that our methods will bring the fastest relief. I think eventually people will look back and realize how important our mission was, even if they don't realize it now.~ /*Everyone seeks the end of the plague. We under Desther merely believe that our methods will bring the swiftest resolution.*/
@34 = ~As you will. Good luck to you.~
@35 = ~W-what? I am a Helmite in service to Desther! Do you know what you risk by threatening me?!~
@36 = ~I serve Aribeth. She will believe me, not you! Do you want this to get ugly?!~
@37 = ~You are right. I'm sorry. Let us forget this.~
@38 = ~MT: Ah, the spiritual and political center. We Helmites have founded a small temple here under the direction of Dester. We are near Nevers Castle, serving as advisors to the main institutions. Not everyone needs our advice, but sooner or later they will be required. There are shops on the outer edge of the county, but I don't know what they sell. No time to go shopping.~ /*We are not far from Castle Never, and serve as advisors in all the major institutions. Not all heed our words, but they will in time.*/
@39 = ~Is your temple accesible? I may need clerical services.~
@40 = ~MT: Ah, actually we would love to show you everything here, but I'm afraid our temple is temporarily closed to the public. Well... er... Although we don't hesitate to treat the sick, we can't let the holy water bowls get contaminated. The temple must remain safe.~ /*You see... ah... Although we treat the sick without hesitation, we can't risk contaminating our blessing pools. We must keep the temple secure.*/
@41 = ~How long has the temple been closed?~
@42 = ~MT: Well, I came with Dester from Helm's Castle shortly after the epidemic started. He made the wise decision to close it as soon as we arrived. This is a shameful but necessary measure. Most of the Helmites here have contracted the plague. Only we, who came with Dester, remained.~ /*Well, I accompanied Desther from Helm's Hold shortly after the plague began. He wisely decided to close it soon after we arrived.*/
@43 = ~Can I ask you about Helm's Hold?~
@44 = ~MT: Oh, I'm not the authority here. That is, of course, I am a Helmite, but I spent a little time in Helm's Castle. It was a long time ago and doesn't matter. There are so many things to do here. Do you need something else?~ /*Besides, it is days away and hardly worth considering. There is so much here that deserves our attention. Do you require anything else?*/
@45 = ~MT: Nest of Beggars? Our blessings bring relief, but we are powerless to contain the plague in the area. They say that the plague could be contained there, but no matter how hard we try to calm people down, it still comes soon.~ /*It was thought the plague could be contained there, but even as we try to calm people, the Wailing follows soon after.*/
@46 = ~Now I fear there is an unforseen threat of undead in the District. Leave it to the Helmites, my friend. Do not endanger yourself there.~
@47 = ~Shouldn't all help be welcome?~
@48 = ~I have heard that the undead that were roaming the area are calmed now. Not that people should endanger themselves facing such things...~
@49 = ~MT: Of course, in the future. The plague will be overcome not by brute force, but by hope in people's hearts. Blessings will put an end to this. Of course, you can do something else, but you need to help in such a way as not to harm even more. We Helmites do whatever is necessary. Our blessings will save the city. Here you will see.~ /*The blessings will accomplish this. Other actions can certainly follow, but care must be taken not to do more harm than good.*/
@50 = ~The Docks are a haven for lawlessness, even in this otherwise dark time. Thankfully my brethren have been mostly left to do their good work.~
@51 = ~MT: A lot of gold has been accumulated. And now the robbers have gone off the chain. I hope this doesn't undermine people's spirits even more. I would avoid the docks, my friend. Let us Helmits distribute blessings and settle things peacefully.~ /*There has also been much hoarding of gold. Muggings are rampant. I hope it does not harm the spirit of the people further.*/
@52 = ~I hear, however, that the area is quite calm now. I hope no one was foolishly put at risk by rash action.~
@53 = ~Blacklake is the home of the nobility, a group that I am sorry to say has not borne the weight of these times in a distinguished manner.~
@54 = ~It is possible they are even hoarding resources meant for the poorer Districts. Hopefully no one inflames the situation.~
@55 = ~MT: They stockpiled provisions in secret from the common citizens of Neverwinter. But something stopped them. I cannot approve of this, the risk to life is too great, but it is often necessary to do without it.~ /*I'm not sure I approve, as the potential for loss of life was high, but I suppose these things must be done.*/
@56 = ~MT: There is a prison on the peninsula. No matter how hard the Helmites try to get there, they won't let us in. I hope my brethren in the area continue to bless the locals and the population will be imbued with our faith. Especially now, when news from the great fortress is so rare. The authorities will need time to sort things out.~ /*Hopefully my brethren in the area have continued their blessings and the spirit of that has found a way within to some degree.*/
@57 = ~MT: There is a prison on the peninsula. No matter how hard the Helmites try to get there, they won't let us in. Perhaps we could have prevented all of these events. Such losses are a great tragedy. I hope there will be no hasty decisions. The soft blessings of the Helmites should be preferred. Souls must be healed.~ /*I hope no further rash action is taken. The gentle blessings of we Helmites should be allowed to take precedence. Spirits must be healed.*/
@58 = ~MT: I saw several people enter the Moonstone Mask in the southeast, right at the main gate. They were clearly hiding from someone. I know almost nothing about this place. I mentioned it just for the sake of completeness. You better avoid it. I heard about a camp where you can hire mercenaries. It's called the Sword Fair and it's in the southeast, but I would advise avoiding it.~ /*I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.*/
@59 = ~MT: Are you a servant of nature? There is a Druid Tree in the Heart of the City, in the southwest of the district. But I myself have never been there. I heard about a camp where you can hire mercenaries. It's called the Sword Fair and it's in the southeast, but I would advise avoiding it.~ /*I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.*/
@60 = ~MT: Helm's temple is closed, but we continue to bless the people. Go to the temple of Tyr, it is on the western side, next to Nevers Castle. You will be assisted there. I heard about a camp where you can hire mercenaries. It's called the Sword Fair and it's in the southeast, but I would advise avoiding it.~ /*I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.*/
@61 = ~MT: If you're adept at arcane magic, you need to head to the Cloak Tower. It is in the east of the region. I heard about a camp where you can hire mercenaries. It's called the Sword Fair and it's in the southeast, but I would advise avoiding it.~ /*I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.*/
@62 = ~MT: If you are a martial arts pro, then Shining Knight Weapons and Armor is your best bet. It's just south of the main square. I heard about a camp where you can hire mercenaries. It's called the Sword Fair and it's in the southeast, but I would advise avoiding it.~ /*I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.*/
@63 = ~MT: You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to &quot;Shining Weapons and Armor for Knights&quot;, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Well, thieves are welcome in the Mask of the Moonstone. I heard about a camp where you can hire mercenaries. It's called the Sword Fair and it's in the southeast, but I would advise avoiding it.~ /*I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southwest, but I would avoid it.*/
@64 = ~MT: Wait a minute! No... I don't want trouble. I... have important work that must not be interrupted. Okay, take your gold... but... I assure you, you're putting an eternal curse on your head. You tease powers you don't understand. Go do your petty atrocities. I have an important task!~ /*Rest assured, <CHARNAME>, that you damn yourself with this act. You anger powers you do not understand. Go, commit your petty evils. I have important work to do!*/
@65 = ~You are foolish beyond measure. Ask what questions you have and get out of my sight.~
@66 = ~You are not welcome in my sight. In fact, be thankful you yet live. You should be dead, but I have important work to do that must not be interrupted by petty vengeance.~
@67 = ~MT: Why are you taking my time? I don't want to talk, I have a lot to do.~ /*What would you make of my time? Speak quickly, for I have much to do.*/
