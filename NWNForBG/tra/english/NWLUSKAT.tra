@0 = ~Hmmm. So you're the one Aarin wants me to let in the gates. You look like trouble, if you ask me. You sure you know what you're doing?~
@1 = ~Why? What's going on in Luskan?~
@2 = ~I need to find the cult.~
@3 = ~Just let me go into the city.~
@4 = ~I'm not ready yet.~
@5 = ~Fighting, and lots of it. The High Captains are at war... have been for weeks, now. Luskan's just about torn apart. I'm sure you're full of questions, but I really can't chat. I promised Aarin a favor, and I'll do it... so do you want inside or not?~ 
@6 = ~Yes, let me inside.~
@7 = ~Aye, Aarin mentioned something along those lines. Had plenty of questions about the wizards in the tower, too. Truth be told, the less I know about what you're up to, the better I'll feel. Do you want inside or not?~ 
@8 = ~Oh that's the way of it, is it? Good thing for you Aarin is an old friend... a favor is a favor. All right... the gates are open for you, now. Just remember: I can't let you back out once you're in. Make sure you have everything you need, you hear?~ 
@9 = ~Oh? Well, if you change your mind, I'll still be here to let you in. A favor's a favor.~
@10 = ~The gate's open for you. Just remember: once you go into Luskan, you can't come back out... period. So get everything you need before you go in.~
