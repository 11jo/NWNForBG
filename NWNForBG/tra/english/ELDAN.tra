Yes, that was the time... And these animals, it seems, are poorly fed... Why hunt such animals... Not like before... Previously, they would not have dared to put animals in cages. The animals are scared... They are scared. Is it an honor to fight them?~ /*A fine collection. Reminds me of my days with the Adaron Aces. I tell you, we would wrangle the biggest meanest... eh... what was it we hunted?*/
