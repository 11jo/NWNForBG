@0 = ~You are welcome in this house of Tyr, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... or what remains of it. I am afraid many of my brethren have either been killed or have abandoned us.~
@1 = ~I am in need of healing.~
@2 = ~MT: Do you have any healing supplies for sale?~ /*Do you have any healing or clerical supplies that you could sell?*/
@3 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~You have survived some battle in our streets, have you? Then you have earned Tyr's blessing. It is the least that I can do to aid you.~
@6 = ~When the temple was attacked, much of our supplies were taken. The acolytes who remain have helped me gather some tinctures and potions and such... come, I will show you.~
@7 = ~I will answer you what I can. What do you wish to know?~
@8 = ~What has happened here?~
@9 = ~Tell me about what's going on in Luskan.~
@10 = ~MT: Farewell. May Tyr keep you.~ /*Tyr grant you justice.*/
@11 = ~MT: There is little left of the temples now, although there used to be a temple of the Just in the north. Now no one needs justice anymore. When the High Captains started to fight each other, they all expected the warrior-priests from our temple to help them. But we wanted to help everyone, and not serve only one ... And we only received suspicions. We have been attacked several times, but the temple fell only recently. I was not in the temple, but on my return I was told that sorcerers and soldiers had suddenly burst in, killed most of my brethren, and plundered the temple.~ /*We were attacked several times, but only recently did the temple fall. I was away from the temple, but upon my return I was told that sorcerers and soldiers had suddenly appeared and slain most of my brethren and looted the temple.*/
@12 = ~That is a very large question, friend. What is it about the city that puzzles you?~
@13 = ~What is all the fighting about?~
@14 = ~Do you know of any cults active in the city?~
@15 = ~Is there no one who can stop all the fighting?~
@16 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@17 = ~MT: The few who survived the battle were imprisoned. I don't know what they did with them. They must have been forced to serve the High Captains after all. The rest of the servants and I can only collect what is left, and we must hurry. Luckily, your Lord Nasher has given us very generous donations... Taking in Aarin Gend and the others is the least we can do.~ /*I can only pick up what pieces remain with the few acolytes I have left and push on. Fortunately your Lord Nasher has been very kind in his donations... housing Aarin Gend and you others is the least we can do.*/
@18 = ~MT: Nobody is sure. There were five High Captains who ruled the city... It must have been on the orders of the wizards from the Brotherhood of Mysteries, but the city was ruled by pirate captains. A few weeks ago, without any warning, the High Captains suddenly began to exterminate each other. Our temple is not the only thing that suffered in this struggle.~ /*Nobody is sure. There were five High Captains who ruled the city... at the bidding of the wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, perhaps, but all five of the pirate lords held power.*/
@19 = ~MT: Hmmm... cults, you say? I was told about all the small sects operating in Luskan. All of them are insignificant. My senior mentor once expressed concern that several High Captains were suspected of having links with a cult dedicated to the evil goddess Oril... But I know little about this.~ /*My master did express concern, once, that several of the High Captains were associating overmuch with a cult dedicated to the evil goddess Auril... but I know little more of it.*/
@20 = ~Nobody except for an invasion by the Lords' Alliance... or the Arcane Brotherhood's intervention, perhaps. For whatever reason, they remain unmoved by all the violence.~
@21 = ~Why do you think that is?~
@22 = ~Who can say? The Brotherhood have always kept to themelves in the Host Tower. No-one but the High Captains themselves ever sees them.~
@23 = ~Welcome, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. You are welcome in the house of the Maimed God. Few of us remain here due to recent hardships... I only ask that you do not add to them.~
@24 = ~The Maimed God bids welcome to a proud defender of good, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Would that our temple were in a condition to give you proper hospitality... few of my brethren remain here, now.~
@25 = ~Greetings. This is the house of Tyr, the Blind Overlord... or perhaps I should say it was. We have been robbed of much and most of my own brethren no longer remain here.~
