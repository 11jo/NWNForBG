@0 = ~What are you doing here? Why have you come? I do not wish to be bothered.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Excuse me. I will leave.~
@3 = ~Geth - at one time a normal man, and not a horrific beast - who hails from Port Llast. Why do you care?~
@4 = ~MT: I have silver charms from Newrick.~ /*I have silver charms - from Neurik.*/
@5 = ~What makes you become werewolf?~
@6 = ~MT: I was sent to finish off the werewolves. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will look for you again.~ /*I've been sent to end the werewolf menace. If you give me your ring, I will leave and no one will come searching for you in the future.*/
@7 = ~I'll try to find some help for you. Stay here.~
@8 = ~I'm here to kill you, Geth. Are you ready?~
@9 = ~Thank you...~
@10 = ~Silver? I might be despondent about my future, but I do not wish it prematurely ended, either.~
@11 = ~If you want to change the future, you must do it yourself.~
@12 = ~This charm comes from Neurik. It is safe.~
@13 = ~Take the charm, or I'll see you dead myself.~
@14 = ~I don't care. I'm killing you now.~
@15 = ~MT: Caratis brought me and some of my friends here: Urt, Bran, and Ender. He wanted us to help him kill the werewolf. It all sounded fun, and this is how it ended. Everyone ran. And we all became werewolves except Ender. As far as I know, he was not caught.~ /*It sounded fun, but this is how it ended. Everyone ran. We all became werewolves except for Ander. As far as I know, he wasn't caught.*/
@16 = ~Do you know where I can find any of them?~
@17 = ~Fine, take it. I need it not. It will not change the course of my life.~
@18 = ~As if I have any interest in going elsewhere. But you wouldn't understand. Fine, farewell - just leave me alone.~
@19 = ~I do not fear death - not as a beast as I am now. If you come for death, then I shall make sure you have it.~
@20 = ~I suppose you're right. If I sit here and do nothing, then nothing will change, right? Fine, give me your silver charm.~
@21 = ~I felt a - flicker of hope. Could it be truth, then? Fine, give me the charm and we will see what happens.~
@22 = ~Karathis told me that I would be safe at his side, and look at me now. No, I think I'll pass on your offer.~
@23 = ~Well, if those are my choices, then I suppose I will take the charm. Death this way or death that way - what does it matter?~
@24 = ~No, I don't. And I grow weary of this conversation. Perhaps we can put it to an end, yes?~
@25 = ~I - am human again! Is this a joke? A dream that I will wake from? Let it be truth! Oh, take my ring, and bring it to Neurik.~
@26 = ~I am overjoyed. I am human again! Thank you, stranger, thank you. I am forever indebted!~
@27 = ~MT: I am human again! What is this, a joke? Or is it all in my dream? I wish this was true!~ /*I - am human again! Is this a joke? A dream that I will wake from? Let it be truth! Oh, take my ring, and bring it to Neurik.*/
@28 = ~Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can't control... Myself!~
@29 = ~Stop hurting me! I will no longer attack you!~
