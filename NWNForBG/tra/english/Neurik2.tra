@0 = ~Oh! Greetings, <CHARNAME>. It's me, Neurik. Remember? I was serving in Tyr's church in Port Llast until Aarin Gend asked me to come and oversee this temple here at Beorunna's Well.~
@1 = ~I remember, Neurik. Good to see you again.~
@2 = ~Sorry, Neurik. I don't remember you.~
@3 = ~NP: I'm surprised you remember me, <CHARNAME>, given all your troubles. The Luscan cult, the betrayal of Aribeth... It's enough to forget your own name, let alone everyone else's! To be honest, I barely recognized you, great hero of Neverwinter. I have a problem that is taking all of my energy to solve.~ /*I'm surprised you remember me, <CHARNAME>, what with everything on your mind. The Luskan cult, Aribeth's betrayal... Why, that's enough to make someone forget their own name!*/
@4 = ~I have need of healing.~
@5 = ~I would like to purchase some supplies.~
@6 = ~Maybe I could help you with this problem.~
@7 = ~I'll be going now.~
@8 = ~NP: I guess it shouldn't surprise me. You must have a lot on your mind, <CHARNAME>, that cult in Luskan, Aribeth's betrayal and all that. To be honest, I barely recognized you, great hero of Neverwinter. I have a problem that is taking all my energy to solve.~ /*I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You've had a lot on your mind, <CHARNAME>, what with the cult in Luskan and Aribeth's betrayal and everything else.*/
@9 = ~The Temple of Tyr shall never refuse the pleas of supplicants in need. Feel his divine mercy and go with his blessing.~
@10 = ~You are welcome to see what I have on hand.~
@11 = ~I don't know. This is a very delicate matter. Recently an Uthgardt tribesman named Rolgan killed one of the Lords' Alliance soldiers. He claims it was self-defense, and I have given him sanctuary here to save him from the vengeance of the soldier's friends.~
@12 = ~Go with Tyr's blessing.~
@13 = ~But Rolgan cannot stay in the Temple forever. I am trying to arrange a fair trial for the young man, but his Uthgardt friends are unfamiliar with our justice system... and none of the Lords' Alliance mercenaries wants to defend him during the trial.~
@14 = ~Maybe I could defend the Uthgardt warrior.~
@15 = ~I could represent the Uthgardt... for a price.~
@16 = ~NP: It is a generous offer. And as a priest of Tyr, I will see that you are compensated handsomely, depending, of course, on the defense you present in court. After careful deliberation, I have selected a jury. There will be two jurors representing the Utgardts, two representing the mercenaries, and my novice, Edegar. It seems to me the only way to ensure a fair verdict.~ /*After careful consideration I have selected the jury. There will be two who represent the interests of the Uthgardt, two who represent the mercenaries, and my own acolyte Edegar. I felt this was the only way to be fair.*/
@17 = ~NP: Those who serve the cause of Justice will be rewarded. If not by Tyr himself, then by his priests. If your defense is worthy, I will see that you are compensated accordingly. After careful deliberation, I have selected a jury. There will be two representing the Uthgardts, two representing the mercenaries, and my novice, Edegar. It seems to me the only way to ensure a fair verdict.~ /*After careful consideration I have selected the jury. There will be two who represent the interests of the Uthgardt, two who represent the mercenaries, and my own acolyte Edegar. I felt this was the only way to be fair.*/
@18 = ~If you agree to undertake this case, I can give you the details. Or is there something else you need.~
@19 = ~I'll do it.~
@20 = ~NP: Take this notebook. It contains information about the jurors and witnesses, as well as the details of the case and the lawsuit itself. Since you represent Tyre, you need to keep this notebook and keep a record of any new aspects of this case. I can briefly tell you everything that is recorded in this notebook. First, the names of the jurors: a mercenary named Averick, a tracker on the Dalsia estate, a soldier named Javon, the Uthgardt witch doctor Palla, and, of course, my servant Edegar.~ /*I can summarize the notebook for you. First, the jurors: a mercenary named Averik, a ranger named Dalcia, a soldier named Jevon, an Uthgardt wise-woman called Palla, and, of course, my own acolyte Edegar.*/
@21 = ~Feel free to speak to any of the jurors before the trial. It is a common practice to do so in these matters. The ranger and Palla can be found in the Uthgardt camp. The others are here in the buildings housing the Lords' Alliance members.~
@22 = ~And what about the witnesses?~
@23 = ~The prosecutor has advised me that he will be calling two mercenaries who witnessed the event, Zed and Lodar. He also will question Vanda, the wife of the accused. I suggest you speak to these people before the trial to gather what evidence you can.~
@24 = ~And of course there's the Uthgardt himself, Rolgan. He doesn't have to testify, but if you call him up to defend his actions, then the prosecutor will also be able to question him. He is here in the back of the Temple here, if you wish to speak with him.~
@25 = ~I'll begin my investigations right away.~
@26 = ~Rolgan is counting on you to bring forth the truth at his trial. Once you have all the evidence, come speak to me and we can begin the proceedings.~

@28 = ~NP: Ah yes... hello again, <CHARNAME>. Welcome to the temple of the god of justice. Forgive me if I seem a bit... upset. Rolgan's future trial has thrown me off my game a bit.~ /*Forgive me if I seem somewhat... distracted. Rolgan's impending trial has me a little out of sorts.*/
@29 = ~NP: Ah, <CHARNAME> - I see you're back already. But, uh. where is your court book? You agreed to defend Rolgan, and without that book, no one will recognize you as a judicial officer! Please, I know you have many other concerns. But if you want to take part in Rolgan's trial, you must keep this book with you at all times.~ /*Ah, <CHARNAME> - I see you are back. But... where is your trial notebook? You agreed to defend Rolgan; without that book no one will recognize you as an officer of the court!*/
@30 = ~In the meantime, is there anything else I can do for you before Rolgan's trial, <CHARNAME>?~
@31 = ~Can I get another copy of the notebook?~
@32 = ~NP: Of course, <CHARNAME>. Here is another copy of the book for you. Remember, you must keep it with you at all times as a symbol of Tyr's authority. Without it, no one will recognize you as a judicial officer.~ /*Of course, <CHARNAME>. Here is another copy of the notebook. Remember, you must keep it on at all times as a symbol ofTyr's authority.*/
@33 = ~Oh... hello, again, <CHARNAME>. Welcome back to the temple of the just god.~
@34 = ~Forgive me if I seem... distracted. The outcome of Rolgan's trial has created as many problems as it seems to have solved.~
@35 = ~NP: What's the problem?~ /*What problem?*/
@36 = ~Forgive me if I seem somewhat... distracted. Rolgan's impending trial has me a little out of sorts.~
@37 = ~I've completed my investigations and I'm ready to begin Rolgan's trial.~
@38 = ~Trial?~
@39 = ~I am grateful for your assistance during Rolgan's trial, <CHARNAME>. This is not a problem you can readily fix.~
@40 = ~Rolgan's trial has been postponed because of the death of one of the participants. However, Tyr's justice must still be served in this matter so I have advised everyone that the case will proceed... though it may be months before I am ready to resume the trial.~

@42 = ~Are you quite certain, my <PRO_LADYLORD>? Once the trial begins it cannot be ended prematurely, or Rolgan's life will be forfeit.~
@43 = ~I'm ready. Let's begin.~
@44 = ~Actually, I need some more time to prepare.~
@45 = ~NP: Don't say you don't remember, <CHARNAME>! You made a promise to defend Rolgan at his trial. I realize you have a lot on your mind, but a man's life is at stake. All the information about this case is in the notebook you carry with you. So, is there anything else you need?~ /*I realize you have a lot on your mind, but a man's life is at stake here. The information is all there in the trial notebook you carry with you.*/
@46 = ~NP: Even though Rolgan was justly convicted, there are those among the Utgardts who believe that the whole thing was a set-up. Since the verdict, tensions between the soldiers and the Utgardts have been steadily rising. I only hope things don't get any worse. But there's hardly anything anyone can do about it. So, is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ /*Tensions between the soldiers and the Uthgardt have only increased since the verdict was issued. I only hope things doesn't escalate further.*/
@47 = ~NP: Even though Rolgan is acquitted, there are those among the Union of Lords soldiers who believe he is guilty of murder and deserves to die. Since the verdict, tensions between the soldiers and the Uthgardts have been steadily rising. I only hope things don't get any worse. But there's hardly anything anyone can do about it. So, is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ /*Even though Rolgan was acquitted there are still those among the Lords' Alliance soldiers who feel he is guilty of murder and deserving of death.*/
@48 = ~NP: You can continue your investigation if you wish, but I doubt you'll be here when we finally close this case. I can always find new counsel when I'm ready to proceed. And you'd better get busy finding Words of Power for Aaryn Gend. Is there anything else I can do for you, <CHARNAME>?~ /*You can continue your investigations if you wish, but I doubt you will still be here when this matter is finally resolved. I can always find a new advocate for the defense when I am finally ready to resume this case. Your time would probably be better served helping Aarin Gend locate the Words of Power.*/
@49 = ~NP: That's great. I know that all parties involved in the trial have an interest in the resolution of this case. I'll give the prosecutor and the other participants the floor. The rules of these proceedings are fairly simple. The jury will listen to the witnesses, the prosecutor and the defense attorney and raise the swords and torches I have given them to find the defendant guilty or not guilty.~ /*The rules of these proceedings are simple. The jurors will listen to the evidence and testimony, and as the trial progresses they will use the swords and torches I have given them to indicate either guilt or innocence.*/
@50 = ~NP: Rolgan is counting on you to get the truth. When you have all the information you need, come back to me and then we can begin the session. Is there anything else I can do for you, <CHARNAME>?~ /*Rolgan is counting on you to bring forth the truth at his trial. Once you have all the evidence, come speak to me and we can begin the proceedings.*/
@51 = ~NP: If the juror decides that the accused is guilty, he will take a sword in his right hand, symbolizing the inevitable stroke of justice. If the juror decides that the accused is innocent, he will raise a torch, which symbolizes the light of truth that has shone over this trial. Just as the jurors' opinions fluctuate, their tools may or may not be used. A juror who is undecided will raise neither sword nor torch. For Rolgan to be released, three jurors will have to raise their torches.~ /*Whenever a juror feels the accused is guilty they will hold forth the sword in their right hand to symbolize the swift strike of justice. If they feel the accused is innocent they will hold up the torch to symbolize the burning light of truth shining down on this trial.*/
@52 = ~What we have now begun cannot end until Justice is served. If the trial is interrupted or broken off before its proper completion, the accused shall be found guilty, regardless of the status of the Jurors. Is this clear?~
@53 = ~I understand. Three jurors or more must be holding a torch to get Rolgan acquitted. And if I end the conversation before we're done, Rolgan suffers.~
@54 = ~Can we go over the rules one more time?~
@55 = ~The rules of these proceedings are simple. The jurors will listen to the evidence and testimony, and as the trial progresses they will use the swords and torches I have given them to indicate either guilt or innocence.~
@56 = ~Now that we are all here the trial can begin. Remember, if you quit the trial before its rightful end, Rolgan's life is forfeit.~
@57 = ~Igland, I have given you a lot of leeway in this case. But you are coming very close to crossing the line of what is acceptable!~
@58 = ~Igland, don't push me.~
@59 = ~Igland! Such comments are not appropriate! The Uthgardt beliefs may differ from our own, but they are not on trial here! Please, <CHARNAME>, continue with your questions.~
@60 = ~I have no more questions for Vanda.~
@61 = ~<CHARNAME>, you may make your closing arguments now.~
@62 = ~The prosecution witnesses never saw who started the fight, so we must accept Rolgan's claim of self defense as truth.~
@63 = ~Igland! Be quiet.~
@64 = ~Because he was drunk, Rolgan is clearly not responsible for his actions.~
@65 = ~Griff spiked Rolgan's drink, making Rolgan more prone to act irrationally.~
@66 = ~Griff cheated at cards, and when he saw Rolgan he attacked him out of fear Rolgan had found out.~
@67 = ~NP: The family valuables that Griff took were religious artifacts for the Black Lion Tribe.~ /*The heirlooms Griff had taken were valuable religious artifacts of great value to the Black Lion tribe.*/
@68 = ~Rolgan is here because he is an Uthgardt, an outsider. Don't let your racist prejudices judge him.~
@69 = ~The defense rests its case.~
@70 = ~Igland, your time to speak is over!~
@71 = ~We know Griff was a violent man who hated the Uthgardt. He probably started the fight himself.~
@72 = ~I'm warning you, Igland!~
@73 = ~I'm getting sick of all these uncalled for remarks, Igland.~
@74 = ~This is not the time for such comments, Igland!~
@75 = ~Spare us your sarcasm, Igland. <CHARNAME> must be allowed to present closing arguments without your snide comments!~
@76 = ~Then as Tyr's representative overseeing this trial, I proclaim judgment in this case. By the light of Tyr's truth, may justice be done!~
@77 = ~NP: The court will not simply tolerate your accusations, young lady. Your husband is here because he killed a man! Don't forget, it was the Temple of Tyre that gave Rolgan asylum! <CHARNAME>, in the future, you might want to advise your client not to call any more members of the court racist during the hearing. It could end badly. Please continue.~ /*<CHARNAME>, in the future you might want to advise your client against calling the jurors racists during the trial. It doesn't go over well. Please, continue with the questions.*/
@78 = ~Tell me why you sent your husband to see Griff.~
@79 = ~Tell me about the significance of the heirlooms your husband had gambled away.~
@80 = ~NP: The verdict is clear, unanimous five to zero in favor of release. Rolgan, you may go, all others are free to go as well. The court thanks you for your time. Igland, you've done your job. I suggest you leave before I make a note somewhere of your disgusting behavior during this session. You dishonor the sacred halls of this temple!~ /*Igland, your work here is done. I suggest you leave before I write you up for your loutish behavior during these proceedings. You are a disgrace to the hallowed halls of this Temple!*/
@81 = ~The verdict is clear, a four to one decision to acquit. Rolgan, you are free to go, as are the rest of you. The court thanks you for time.~
@82 = ~NP: Igland, you've done your job. I suggest you leave before I make a note somewhere of your disgusting behavior during this meeting. You dishonor the sacred halls of this Temple! <CHARNAME>, come talk to me whenever you want to talk.~ /*Igland, your work here is done. I suggest you leave before I write you up for your loutish behavior during these proceedings. You are a disgrace to the hallowed halls of this Temple!*/
@83 = ~The verdict is clear, a three to two decision to acquit. Rolgan, you are free go, as are the rest of you. The court thanks you for time.~
@84 = ~I do not see three torches in the jury, the verdict is clear: guilty as charged. Rolgan shall be taken away for immediate execution. The rest of you are dismissed. The court thanks you for time.~
