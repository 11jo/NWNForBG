@0 = ~Please, my <LADYLORD>... spare my life! I shall give you whatever you like...~ [NWRIMA55]
@1 = ~Answer my questions, then.~
@2 = ~Give me everything of worth you have, wizard.~
@3 = ~Go on... run, and don't come back.~
@4 = ~Grovelling won't save your worthless hide! Die!~
@5 = ~What... do you wish to know?~
@6 = ~Tell me who you are.~
@7 = ~I want more information on the cult.~
@8 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@9 = ~Take it, then. It is not much, perhaps, but it is all I have on me. Will you allow me to flee the tower, my <LADYLORD>? I have done as you have asked...~ 
@10 = ~I have questions I want answered, first.~
@11 = ~Thank you, my <LADYLORD>! You are a kind and merciful <MANWOMAN>! I swear you shall never see me again!~
@12 = ~No! It cannot end like this! Maugrim save me!!~
@13 = ~My name is Rimardo Domine, my <LADYLORD>. Once I was... Overwizard of the East Tower. That was before Arklem was overthrown, however.~
@14 = ~And what are you doing here now, then?~
@15 = ~Who was Arklem overthrown by?~
@16 = ~Who is this Arklem?~
@17 = ~I want to know something else.~
@18 = ~I have no more questions. Now you will die!~
@19 = ~Maugrim is behind it all, my <LADYLORD>. There is some other mistress that he serves... but I know nothing of it. Maugrim kept it a secret from all but his followers, and they are fanatics.~
@20 = ~What does this cult want? Why are they doing all this?~
@21 = ~Where is Maugrim?~
@22 = ~Who are his supporters?~
@23 = ~Will you allow me to flee the tower, my <LADYLORD>? I have done as you have asked...~
@24 = ~But I... have nothing left, my <LADYLORD>. You have taken it all. Will you allow me to flee the tower, my <LADYLORD>? I have done as you have asked...~
@25 = ~Maugrim has been... forcing me to create golems. War golems for use in his army.~
@26 = ~Tell me more about Maugrim.~
@27 = ~Why would he need an army?~
@28 = ~Maugrim and his cult, of course. Maugrim has been converting followers amongst the wizards ever since his arrival.~
@29 = ~When did Maugrim arrive?~
@30 = ~Just how did the cult manage to take over?~
@31 = ~He... he is building an army, my <LADYLORD>. The High Captains, the forces of the north, the brotherhood... he gathers them all to build a great army.~
@32 = ~I... I think he's at the top of the tower my <LADYLORD> .~
@33 = ~Maugrim performs many secret rituals... he has few confidantes. The only one he keeps with him constantly is the elf woman, Aribeth.~
@34 = ~Aribeth?~
@35 = ~Maugrim believes that there is some hidden power at Neverwinter's heart and he has rallied his forces to lay claim to it. His mistress needs what lies there... needs it badly. He has sent his agents throughout the North to search for... for more of this power. I... I do not know what it is, exactly, however...~ 
@36 = ~You are lying. You know more than you're saying.~
@37 = ~Are you telling me everything you know?~
@38 = ~Arklem Greeth was the Archmage Arcane of the Brotherhood... until the battles began. I think he fled before the fighting got very bad. He is a powerful mage and will return to teach this... usurper... a thing or two, I know it. Why Arklem let the Brotherhood fall to the cult I do not know.~ 
@39 = ~Maugrim came to us more than a year ago, though I know not from where. He was charismatic and obviously possessed of strong magic. Arklem listened eagerly to his promises of power. Maugrim hinted that the mistress he served could bring great success to the Arcane Brotherhood. He would tell us nothing of his mistress, but our greed overcame our better judgment. We allowed him to take our pupils under his wing to teach them his secrets.~ 
@40 = ~N-no, please... ask me about something else...~
@41 = ~Tell me what you know.~
@42 = ~Fine, I want to ask you something else.~
@43 = ~I... I am, of course...~
@44 = ~Are you sure you don't want to tell me more?~
@45 = ~Fine. Then I guess I'll have to kill you.~
@46 = ~I despise people who lie to me. I would have to hurt them.~
@47 = ~Each became another fanatic in his following, working secretly to do his bidding. It was not long before Maugrim had followers throughout the towers, spreading like a plague in our midst. When we finally discovered what was happening, it was too late. Arklem fled from our midst and Maugrim sought to take over. It... it was a long and bloody battle, but Maugrim has won.~ 
@48 = ~Please... don't hurt me! Maugrim... he seeks something for his mistress! That... that's all I can tell you!~
@49 = ~You needn't fear reprisal from Maugrim. I intend to kill him.~
@50 = ~Your life is in my hands. You had best tell me all you know.~
@51 = ~Either you start talking or I start removing your fingers!~
@52 = ~I... I can tell you nothing more, I swear it!~
@53 = ~I knew it! You are lying to me! Time to die!!~
@54 = ~What Maugrim looks for so desperately... what he believes lies in Neverwinter and elsewhere in the north... he calls the Words of Power. The Brotherhood has never heard of these 'words,' and I have no clue what they might be. Maugrim is desperate to locate them for his mistress, however. He has sent his agents throughout the north to track them down. He... already has one, I believe... and he will take the rest by force or whatever other means he must.~ 
@55 = ~No! Maugrim has great power... he will hunt me! There are things he can do that... that are worse than death!~
@56 = ~That... that is all I know, my <LADYLORD>. Please believe me.~
@57 = ~What are you doing within the Host Tower?! This will not be tolerated!~ [NWRIMA53]
