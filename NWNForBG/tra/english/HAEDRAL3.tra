@0 = ~**hiss** I see you still live, warm-blood. **hiss** I feared you had perished with Morag and the rest of the Old Ones when the Source Stone collapsed.~
@1 = ~What is this place, Haedraline? How did I get here?~
@2 = ~The Source Stone collapsed? What are you talking about?~
@3 = ~You again? What do you want now?~
@4 = ~I am anxious to return to my own world, Haedraline.~
@5 = ~When you destroyed Morag you destroyed her magic as well. **hiss** The world she had created - the Source Stone - crumbled into nothingness, and all trapped within it were utterly consumed. **hiss**~
@6 = ~You have done everything I have asked of you, warm-blood. **hiss** Morag has been defeated, the magic of the Words of Power is broken. **hiss**~
@7 = ~I used my magic to open a portal from the collapsing Source Stone into this astral pocket, a temporary place of refuge between that world and your own. **hiss** I am glad you found the portal and escaped with your life, warm-blood.~
@8 = ~The Creator Race can never return, and never again will I be a Word Slave. **hiss** You are free to leave this astral realm at any time, with my thanks. The portal behind me will take you back to your own world.~
@9 = ~**hiss** My time here grows short. The Words of Power are broken and my magic is fading. **hiss** Soon I will pass from this existence and this astral pocket will also collapse.~
@10 = ~Pass from this existence? Are you dying?~
@11 = ~So it's over, then? Neverwinter is safe once more?~
@12 = ~The time of the Creator Race is over. **hiss** There is no place for me in your world now, just as there was no place for Morag. I have accepted this, warm-blood.~
@13 = ~You have faced Morag and the Old Ones and triumphed. **hiss** Even the foul and ancient magics of the dark Queen could not stand against your might.~
@14 = ~You are the savior of Neverwinter, warm-blood - but you are also much, much more. **hiss** You have altered the fate of not just your own world, but a thousand others that would have fallen to Morag's armies.~
@15 = ~I did my duty.~
@16 = ~Maybe people should start bowing down before my awesome greatness.~
@17 = ~For all the work I did you'd think I could get more of a reward.~
@18 = ~Few could have faced Morag's power and survived. **hiss** But even though you have ended the threat of the Creator Race your work is far from done, for I have seen glimpses of what fate awaits you.~
@19 = ~**hiss** You speak with arrogance, but there is truth in your words.~
@20 = ~I have marked well your evil nature, warm-blood. **hiss** You hunger for power and wealth, you seek to dominate and destroy those who will not bow down before you. **hiss**~
@21 = ~You are a champion of the North, a defender against all that is dark and evil. **hiss** Hold fast to what you believe to be true and your courage shall not fail when you face your greatest challenge.~
@22 = ~Your legend and fame will continue to grow, spreading throughout the North. **hiss** But Morag will not be the most dangerous foe you face in your lifetime. **hiss** As you become ever more powerful, so will those who seek to destroy you.~
@23 = ~Take heed of my warning, warm blood. You are not so different from my people - or from Morag herself. **hiss** As your terrible legend grows, so will the power and conviction of those who stand against you.~
@24 = ~The city of Neverwinter is still vulnerable, and there are other enemies who seek to destroy it - and you. **hiss** There are sinister forces that will ally against you, for you are a symbol of all that is righteous and good.~
@25 = ~There are many who will try to steal that which you have worked so hard for, and others will seek to forge their own legend by destroying you. **hiss** Your enemies will band together, they will strike when you least expect it. **hiss** That is the price of fame and fortune.~
@26 = ~Heroes will rise to challenge your tyranny, just as you rose to challenge Morag. **hiss** Hoard your power and marshal your forces, for you will need all your resources to triumph against those who would cast you down.~
@27 = ~Who are these upstarts who will dare to stand against me?~
@28 = ~More than this I cannot say, for my magic has grown weak with the destruction of the Words of Power, and the mists of time cloud my vision.~
@29 = ~Quickly now, warm-blood. I cannot sustain this astral pocket much longer. **hiss** The portal behind me will return you to your own world.~
@30 = ~I thank you for all you have done - never again will I be a Word Slave. **hiss** Go through the portal so that I may finally pass to my long awaited eternal rest.~
@31 = ~Why have you returned, warm-blood? **hiss** My magic cannot sustain this astral pocket much longer. You must leave through the portals and return to your own world so that I may finally be free to pass from this existence.~
@32 = ~MT: Расскажи мне о своем видении моего будущего.~ /*Tell me again about your vision of my future.*/
