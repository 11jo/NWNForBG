@0 = ~Well then, what would a person of your manners be doing here? I've only a minute, so your introduction must be quick. Too much to do.~ [NWHARB50]
@1 = ~<CHARNAME> is my name. I'm helping Aribeth.~
@2 = ~What is my name to you? Why should I tell you?~
@3 = ~I've no time to speak right now. Farewell.~
@4 = ~You're one of the new guards? Land and lord, why didn't you say so? Your job will be finding the source of the zombie infestation.~
@5 = ~That's you? I expected green recruits, but I've heard how you've been helping find those blasted Waterdhavian creatures already! Glad you've come. It's a mess in here right now. We've got a zombie infestation, and it will be your job to root out what's behind it.~ 
@6 = ~And why wouldn't you? Goodness, you are making this unnecessarily difficult. Tell me or don't, but I have a lot to do.~
@7 = ~You've got no time? Well, join the bloody club. Go on then, and don't come back unless you're someone willing to help.~
@8 = ~We've been up to our necks in undead. Even deeper for short folk like me. The Beggar's Nest is just a mess, it is.~
@9 = ~Are the undead linked to the plague? When did this start?~
@10 = ~Is there an identifiable enemy behind this?~
@11 = ~Are there any safe locations in the district?~
@12 = ~A Waterdhavian creature was in another district. Think there's one here?~
@13 = ~Do you know anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~Who are you? What is your role here?~
@15 = ~I heard some things about the local Sword Coast Boys gang. Don't know a lot, but they seem involved. I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.~ 
@16 = ~Tell me about the Sword Coast Boys.~
@17 = ~Go over the basic run down of the area.~
@18 = ~Goodbye.~
@19 = ~I heard some things about a local Cult, or some such. Don't know too much, but it seems they are a concern. I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.~ 
@20 = ~Tell me about this local Cult.~
@21 = ~I heard some things about the Sword Coast Boys gang, and a little about a local Cult, or some such. I think they have something to do with the undead. I may say something you already know. I can only repeat what the guards have heard. Some of this you probably did yourself.~ 
@22 = ~Don't know if the two are linked. Not all plague victims become undead, but the ones that do hardly hit the ground before rising. The plague was here before the zombies, though, and it was only a few days ago that the undead became a horde.~ 
@23 = ~If I find out anything I'll let you know.~
@24 = ~I wish I knew. Like I said, that will be your job. You find out who's behind this and take 'em out. There are rumors, sure, but nothing makes much sense right now, and I don't have time to talk to everyone.~
@25 = ~What rumors have you heard?~
@26 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@27 = ~Well, you're kinda standing in one, smarty. The Helmite temple is another, though you have to suffer their soggy blessings. I got nothing against them, I guess. Gives people hope, but all their splashing hasn't scared the plague away yet.~ 
@28 = ~Aribeth has you chasing those things, hmm? Well, don't blab it around to everyone. If people hear that we lost a shot at the cure... I'm sorry, but I don't know where those things might have gone, and I ain't even sure what they were. I got zombies to worry about now.~ 
@29 = ~Me? Harben Ashensmith. I just have a bit of unofficial rank because the people around here respect me. I did some things in the old days and made a few friends. Someone had to step up and help. I may not have a uniform, but I get things done. Now, what's on your mind?~ 
@30 = ~A lad named Krestal fears that the Sword Coast Boys have made a deal with a strange creature. Their leader, Drawl, has become a powerful undead. These are alarming tales, but I can't spare anyone to check out the warehouse the gang uses as a base. Perhaps you could? It's in the north central of the Beggar's Nest, but take care. Drawl has apparently killed off all his rivals... including many of his own gang.~ 
@31 = ~I guess it's a snake worshipping cult, of all things. They are in league with someone named Gulnan. Gulnan... Where have I heard that... Oh boy. That name was on one of the crates brought from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures. What the heck did we bring in that could cause a mess like this? I'll be asking about this when Castle Never is back open, that's for sure!~ 
@32 = ~Careful out there. And remember, I'll make your efforts worth your while.~

@35 = ~Here's the thing. I know you're just supposed to keep the peace, but we're up against a wall here. You find out what's happening, and I'll make it worth your while over and above whatever Aribeth wants from you. So off you go then. And make sure you talk to Drake if you haven't. He's an undead hunter from way back.~
@36 = ~Like I said, I haven't had time to talk to anyone about it, but a couple of boys have said they heard things. Krestal and Jemanie. Don't know much about them. Krestal lives just north of the Helmite shrine. Jemanie lives over in the central west section. I think Drake will probably tell you of them as well. He's trying to organize rescues. That's all I know.~ 
@37 = ~What do you need to know?~
@38 = ~Seach that estate top to bottom. This Gulnan creature had to contact them somehow, and it wasn't by knocking on the door.~
@39 = ~Is the creature justified? Neverwinter would've used it in a spell.~
@40 = ~Don't go feeling sorry for it. Sure, some of the creatures were a little more... sentient than others... but there's more to it. The spell to cure the plague isn't supposed to be lethal, and I heard some of these things came willingly, even out of charity. Of course, rumors say one was imprisoned in Waterdeep, and probably saw the trip as a chance to escape. Don't know any more than that, though.~ 
@41 = ~Who might you be, then? Speak up, speak up, I can't spend much time on pleasantries right now. Too much to do.~ [NWHARB51]
@42 = ~What manner of malcontent are you? Say who you are and why I should bother with you. I've got a lot to worry about right now.~ [NWHARB52]
@43 = ~Back again, hmm? Need a recap?~ [NWHARB53]
@44 = ~Have you had any updates? Any new information?~
@45 = ~Not as such. We're still up to our armpits in dead things. You find anything out, let me know.~
@46 = ~Tell me about this Snake Cult.~
@47 = ~Seems Drawl, the leader of the Sword Coast Boys, has become a powerful undead. Killed his rivals... some of his own gang too. Something named Gulnan was behind it... Gulnan... Where have I heard that... Oh boy. That name was on one of the crates brought from Waterdeep. It must be one of the creatures. What the heck did we bring in that could cause a mess like this? I'll be asking about this when Castle Never is back open, that's for sure!~
@48 = ~You'd better check the Sword Coast Boys' warehouse in the Beggar's Nest north central. This Gulnan contacted Drawl somehow, and not by walking the streets openly.~
@49 = ~Now, who might you be, then? I don't have a lot of time to talk. We're busy with clean up now that the zombie threat seems to be over.~ [NWHARB55]
@50 = ~Who are you?~
@51 = ~I found the Waterdhavian Yuan-Ti creature. It raised the zombies.~
@52 = ~I killed the creature that caused the undead.~
@53 = ~Me? Oh, I'm nobody, really. Folks around here kind of look to me as a representative of the militia, but I'm no guard. Unofficial rank, I guess you'd call it. Still, they like me well enough that I can get things done. That's valuable, you know? More so than uniforms and whatnot. So, what's on your mind?~ 
@54 = ~A Yuan-Ti? The search for a cure must not be going well if they are willing to risk dealing with one of those. I have no information on what to do with it. You'd best take it to Aribeth. She'll want a look at it.~ 
@55 = ~Am I to be rewarded for my efforts?~
@56 = ~Reward time. Cough something up or I get nasty.~
@57 = ~I want to talk about the reward.~ 
@58 = ~A Yuan-Ti? The search for a cure must not be going well if they are willing to risk dealing with one of those. I have no information on what to do with it. You'd best take it to Aribeth. She'll want a look at it.~ 
@59 = ~Yes, I know, and I have already given you the reward that you deserved. We cannot afford any more.~
@60 = ~And thank you again. Good luck.~
@61 = ~Fair enough. I know Aribeth is more keen on duty as its own reward. Me, I like coins. Here's 500 gold for you, and an item that I was saving for just the right person. Yer a hero... and likable, too.~ 
@62 = ~Come now. Don't I deserve more than that?~
@63 = ~Me tough and scary. You give more!~
@64 = ~Thanks. Farewell.~
@65 = ~No need to get testy. I had gold put aside for whoever helped out. You'll get your share. Here's 500 gold for you, and an item that I was saving for just the right person. Yer a hero... and likable, too.~ 
@66 = ~I have already given out a reward. I am very grateful for any assistance, but we can afford no more.~
@67 = ~All right, but don't go wearing out your welcome. This is coming out of my own pocket. Beat it.~

@69 = ~I don't think that would be very fair. I've paid what I can and there's not much more.~
@70 = ~Well, you know, I WOULD do that, but there's this thing me and Drake have about bullies. We don't appreciate 'em. We were short people to help and you filled the bill. You got your fair share, and now you should leave.~ 
@71 = ~Thank you. Be safe out there.~
@72 = ~I knew you'd help us, by Whilliker's whiskers. I heard about what you did before, and knew you'd take care of business. If you found anything important in that mess, report it to Aribeth. She's keeping score, or some such.~ [NWHARB56]
