@0 = ~NP: Great fight! You have shown strength by defeating Kallik. This guy was trying to stop me. And he had absolutely no sense of style. Still, judging by your stern look, I guess my troubles aren't over yet, are they?~ [NWVENG50] /*Well fought! You have proven quite the force, defeating Callik like that. The lad was giving me trouble. No sense of style.*/
@1 = ~I've come for the Cockatrice, Vengaul.~
@2 = ~You have something that doesn't belong to you.~
@3 = ~Your actions caused no end of chaos!~
@4 = ~NP: Of course of course. This was to be expected, although I had hope that Nasher would personally appear. I managed to find the remains of a beautiful bird that Nasher and his henchmen lost. Imagine my surprise when I saw her carried down the street in the mouth of a dog. And it occurred to me to find a better use for them.~ /*I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.*/
@5 = ~Now you'll hand it over for the good of everyone.~
@6 = ~I demand you give me the Waterdhavian creature! And your weapons!~
@7 = ~You'll be paying a high price this time. I can't let you live.~
@8 = ~NP: I think your point of view is not devoid of logic. And since you are the predominant force in this room, I bow to your wisdom. I managed to find the remains of a beautiful bird that Nasher and his henchmen lost. Imagine my surprise when I saw her carried down the street in the mouth of a dog. And it occurred to me to find a better use for them.~ /*I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.*/
@9 = ~NP: Nonsense. I just expressed a thought or two. How people react to it is none of my business. I managed to find the remains of a beautiful bird that Nasher and his henchmen lost. Imagine my surprise when I saw her carried down the street in the mouth of a dog. And it occurred to me to find a better use for them.~ /*I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost.

@10 = ~NP: Of course I will. Oh, don't be so surprised. Why do I need this lousy bird? Besides, I am well aware of how important the feathers of this creature are. I wanted Nasher to want to take it from me. But since he refused to play, and most of my people turned their backs on me, the fun is over. The remains of this creature are in the chest. Please accept these feathers and my blessing. You know, some of my friends got the plague too. Nasher knows who I'm talking about.~ /*Of course I will. Oh, don't look so surprised. What am I going to do with some mangy bird? Besides, I know full well how important the feathers of this beast are.*/
@11 = ~Okay. You get going then.~
@12 = ~You've hurt too many people with this.~
@13 = ~NP: My weapon? You really run into conflict. Will you forgive me if I just leave? My lieutenants will be able to respond to your bloodthirstiness. May the strongest win the prize!~ /*You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!*/
@14 = ~That's a blanketing statement. Why, may I ask, do you deem it necessary to kill me?~
@15 = ~Just for a laugh, really.~
@16 = ~Sounds like Nasher would appreciate you being dead.~
@17 = ~Just trying to intimidate you a bit. No harm meant.~
@18 = ~As you will. Farewell, my friend. Our paths will cross again, I am sure.~
@19 = ~NP: It is not my fault. Desperate people do desperate things. Would you kill a baker if they rebelled against bread? Will you forgive me if I just leave? My lieutenants will be able to respond to your bloodthirstiness. May the strongest win the prize!~ /*You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!*/
@20 = ~NP: Then 'just for fun', I'll do my best to escape. I don't want to die here. Not after I gave this creature away. The remains are the creatures in the chest. Send them to Nasher and say hello to him. Though I doubt he'll have time for a scoundrel like you.~ /*The remains of the creature are in a crate. Send it to Nasher with my regards, though I doubt he'll have time for a scoundrel like you.*/
@21 = ~NP: You don't know the old man as well as I do. We have been holding each other by the throat for many years. He would not approve of my death or imprisonment. All of this might be an insult, but deep down, Nasher likes all this controversy. Will you forgive me if I just leave? My lieutenants will be able to respond to your bloodthirstiness. May the strongest win the prize!~ /*You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!*/
@22 = ~Well, a great deal of harm was taken. I'll just take my leave. You'll find what you need in my absence, I am sure.~
