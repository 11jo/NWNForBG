@0 = ~I am so grateful. I... I'm just stunned that someone would bother to help us... thank you.~
@1 = ~I'm... I'm at the bottom. Things can't get worse. Who'd have thought this was how it would end?~
@2 = ~Is there nothing the guards can do? Burn down the Great Graveyard? Something? Anything...~
@3 = ~What do you want? I've nothing for you... I had to leave everyting to flee the zombies... I've nothing...~
@4 = ~I hate this place. Fools trying to act like everything will be okay. Well, nothing is okay... we're all doomed.~
@5 = ~Can you understand having nothing? Having to leave everything or die? Can anyone understand...~
@6 = ~So this is where I will die... great. They can't keep the zombies out forever...~
@7 = ~What can you trust if you can't trust the dead to stay down? How can anything be normal after that?~
@8 = ~I guess I could have tried to go to the Helmite sanctuary... but they are always treating plague victims there. I don't want to get sick...~
@9 = ~At least you can outrun zombies for a while, but the plague... I don't have a clue how to avoid that.~
@10 = ~Where do we go now... there's nowhere. We just wait for the zombies to get us here, I guess...~
@11 = ~I heard some people tried to get to the City Core but the guards wouldn't let them out past the gate. They didn't want the plague to spread...~
@12 = ~Slow death to plague or quick death to zombies... maybe the undead are the merciful way out after all.~
@13 = ~What is left... nothing. The living fear the plague... the dead can't rest. Why go on?~
@14 = ~These are the last days... I'm sure of it. Plague, undead... all we need is a plague of vermin and I'm calling it quits.~
