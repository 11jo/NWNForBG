@1 = ~Answer my question and prove you are my proper inheritor. Fail, and burn for dishonoring my legacy with your ignorance.~
@2 = ~I will meet your challenge. Speak it.~
@3 = ~I apologize for disturbing you. I will leave.~
@4 = ~I do not jump through hoops! Defend yourself!~
@5 = ~So be it. Show your knowledge of my legacy. The clan of my siblings, now dust, just as I... What was it called?~

@24 = ~If it's any consolation, I am on an important quest.~
@25 = ~Don't blame me. I was just hunting bears.~
@26 = ~MT: You have strange manners, but the answer is quite satisfactory. Take what I have and fulfill the prophecy made with my death. I have not been forgotten. Finally, I can rest.~ /*Your manner is strange, but the answer satisfies. Take my great possessions and fulfill the prophecies laid down at my death.*/
@27 = ~MT: What? No, nothing like that. Look, I'm dead, so I don't say much. Stupid. &quot;Another Mystery&quot;<HESHE> speaks. Thanks a lot. Do you know how long I've been here? A? Yes, before my eyes, drops of water destroyed stones. To see a snail - and that entertainment was!~ /*What? No, no I don't. See, I'm dead so I don't get out much. Idiot. "Another riddle," <PRO_HESHE> says. Thanks a lot.*/
@28 = ~Should'a walked toward the light when I had the chance. I don't believe this.~

Yes, before my eyes, drops of water destroyed stones. To see a snail - and that entertainment was!~ /*Do you know how long I've been here? Hah? I've watched water drips melt rock. A snail is a year's worth of excitement!*/

Yes, before my eyes, drops of water destroyed stones. To see a snail - and that entertainment was!~ /*Do you know how long I've been here? Hah? I've watched water drips melt rock. A snail is a year's worth of excitement!*/
@31 = ~MT: Hunting... bears? So you're out here chasing beasts and suddenly you stumble upon my ancient tomb? Well, I feel like an important person. Yeah,<SIRMAAM> . Do you know how long I've been here? A? Yes, before my eyes, drops of water destroyed stones. To see a snail - and that entertainment was!~ /*Hunting... bears? You were killing simple animals and just stumbled on my centuries old tomb? Well, I certainly feel important now. Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>.*/
@32 = ~MT: My cause... and my people... are long gone, but even spirits have pride, and I will get the respect I deserve.~ /*A contendor approaches. My cause... my people... vanished long ago, but my spirit is vain, and I will have the respect I am due.*/
@33 = ~I'm going now.~
@34 = ~MT: You on purpose! Don't you dare make fun of my fate! I won't be ridiculed anymore.~ /*"Now you're just laughing at me. I'm not saying any more."*/
@35 = ~MT: Fool! I'm just a shadow, and you can't hurt me. You won't get anything.~ /*You tilt without reason. I am a shade of what I was, and cannot be made less than I am. You will have nothing.*/
