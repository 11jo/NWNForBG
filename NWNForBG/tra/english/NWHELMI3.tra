@0 = ~Greetings. Are you in need of a blessing? I would not travel the docks without it, lest you tempt the fates.~
@1 = ~What can you tell me about the Seedy Tavern?~
@2 = ~Has there been any sign of a break in the plague?~
@3 = ~What good do your blessings do?~
@4 = ~I will have a blessing.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~It is a den of corruption. I would not trust the word of any who frequent there. Lies and false hopes are their playground. Graciously, they keep to themselves, only allowing entry to uniformed members and those willing to part with their ill-gotten coins.~ /*It is a den of corruption. I would not trust the word of any who frequent there. Lies and false hopes are their playground.*/
@7 = ~The Wailing continues to take lives, but Desther has decreed that we brothers shall not rest while the city is in crisis. If the spirit is willing, Neverwinter will survive. People must believe and have hope, and so our blessings will continue.~ /*If the spirit is willing, Neverwinter will survive. People must believe and have hope, and so our blessings will continue.*/
@8 = ~If this plague is a spiritual one, which Desther strongly suspects, then the healing must begin with the soul. The worth of the blessings is immeasurable. Even as the Wailing takes the body, the mind knows there is hope.~ /*The worth of the blessings is immeasurable. Even as the Wailing takes the body, the mind knows there is hope.*/
@9 = ~But the body still dies. How does that give hope?~
@10 = ~Very good. Let your mind be at ease and know that tomorrow will bring a cure.~
@11 = ~Another time, then. I will be here, as will all of the devout under Desther and Helm.~
@12 = ~Well... it's complex. Even in death people must realize that... that there is purpose to all things. You seem strong in your faith. You understand how important belief is, and how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.~ /*You seem strong in your faith. You understand how important belief is, and how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.*/
@13 = ~Well... it's complex. Even in death people must realize that... that there is purpose to all things. I can't expect you to understand, but just imagine how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.~ /*I can't expect you to understand, but just imagine how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.*/
