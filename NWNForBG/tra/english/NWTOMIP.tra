@0 = ~NP: Your company was disgusting! When we meet again, I'm not going to play friendship anymore!~ [NWTOMITT] /*You no be safe with me. Me got lots big danger.*/
@1 = ~Wha-aat? Are you kidding me? You want to break up a great team?~ [NWTOMIDN]
@2 = ~Yes. Go.~
@3 = ~No. Stay.~
@4 = ~NP: Oh, okay, okay. I'm just gonna hang around a little longer in case you change your mind.~ /*Oh, fine, fine. I'll hang about here for a little while, then, just in case you change your mind.*/
@5 = ~NP: Go back to the sword fair.~ /*Get to the point.*/
@6 = ~NP: I'll find you at Kendrak Barracks.~ /*Port Llast - Kendrack's Barracks*/
@7 = ~NP: Wait for me here.~ /*Wait right here.*/
@8 = ~Fair enough. Back to the adventure!~
@9 = ~I figured they'd drag your carcass back here eventually, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. You need me to come with ya again?~ [NWTOM060]
@10 = ~Yep.~
@11 = ~No.~
@12 = ~Lead the way!~
@13 = ~Well, you know where I'll be, then.~
@14 = ~Well, now, if it isn't <CHARNAME>! Glad I am to see you! Isn't the country wonderful this time of year? So much better than the city with all that... umm... burning and dying. You know.~ [NWTOM053]
@15 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Tomi.~
@16 = ~You again? Are you following me around?~
@17 = ~Goodbye.~
@18 = ~NP: Yeah, well, what do you want from a halfling? Where the money goes, I go. After our paths parted, Mamzelle Aribet came up to me and gave me a lot of money to sign up for this pleasure ride of hers. We should all help with the search. Looks like Lord Nasher wants to weed out all those sectarians who started the fight. Well done, I think! Living proof that not all old people should be killed for being useless, isn't he?~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@19 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@20 = ~NP: How much would it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@21 = ~NP: Well, uh. maybe there is a little bit. After all, there aren't that many employers left alive for them to line up for me, right? Besides. you don't have much to chase after. Looks like Lord Nasher wants to wipe out all those sectarians who started the fight. Well done, I think! He's living proof that not all old people should be killed for being useless, isn't he?~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@22 = ~Uh-huh. Toodle-loo!~
@23 = ~NP: I've already been paid by that ma'am Aribet. and not bad, by the way, I'll tell you that. You'd think this guy Nasher would be shitting gold. All I was told was to help in any way I can. That's a nice, non-binding demand, isn't it? I, uh, I don't think you really want anything, do you?~ /*I was just told that I'm supposed to help out wherever I can. How sweet and unspecific is that? I, uh, don't suppose you actually want something, do you?*/
@24 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@25 = ~I could use a good rogue by my side.~
@26 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@27 = ~Okey-dokey! If you find yourself in need of a rougue, I'm already bought and paid for... just need to know where the party is.~
@28 = ~Nothing more than anyone, no. You ask me, though, Luskan's the place to look.~
@29 = ~Luskan?~
@30 = ~Well, isn't it a coincidence that I happen to be a good rogue? Fine... this one-rabbit town was beginning to bore me, anyway.~
@31 = ~Besides a bath? Suit yourself, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@32 = ~NP: Yeah, well. This town's full of thieves and pirates. Anybody's welcome there, as long as it ain't white and fluffy, that's for sure. I've been there a couple times myself. Where better for a frog to hide than among the toads? Not that I have any proof or anything.~ /*Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself.*/
@33 = ~NP: Hey, <LADYLORD>! Can't live without Tomy the Hangman, huh? All that work for ma'amselle Aribet. this whole cult guy thing. has been a lot of fun so far. Nothing to do but stare at suspicious characters.~ [NWTOM055] /*This job of Miss Aribeth's... looking for them cult fellows... it's been pretty sweet so far. Haven't had to do much 'cept stare at people all suspicious-like.*/
@34 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@35 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@36 = ~Do you intend to just sit around here, then?~
@37 = ~NP: It looks like Lord Nasher wants to kill all those sectarians who started the quarrel. Well done, I think! A living proof that not all old people should be killed for being useless, right? Anyway, Mademoiselle Aribet has given me a lot of coin to join this quest. Well done, so far.~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@38 = ~NP: Well, I don't think I could have done much on my own, <LADYLORD>. Hell, they just told me to get the hell outta here and wait until someone needed me. It's not like I'm a hero like you... although I'm a hell of a rogue, pardon the immodesty. This town's a bore. I've already counted 14 chickens crossing the road. I guess if you need me, I'll gladly go wherever you want me to go.~ /*This town is kind of boring. So far I've counted fourteen chickens that crossed the road. I suppose, if you needed me, I'd be happy to tag along with ya.*/
@39 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra body. You're in.~
@40 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@41 = ~All righty, then, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>... I'm all yours. If ya need me to do something other than what I'm doing, just give me a shout.~
