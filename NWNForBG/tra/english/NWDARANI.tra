@0 = ~Thank you for saving me... if that is indeed what you have done. I do not know you, or your motives.~ [NWDARA51]
@1 = ~Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.~
@2 = ~And I don't know you. Should I care?~
@3 = ~You'll die if you need to.~
@4 = ~NP: Its nice to hear a kind voice. These people could not be called affectionate, and their questions all the time became more and more insistent. I am Daranay, and I count on your mercy. I hoped Vengaul sent you, but I have no word from him. His auction did not take place.~ /*I am Dara'nei, and I am at your mercy. I'd hoped you were sent by Vengaul, but I haven't heard from him. His auction was called off.*/
@5 = ~I want to ask about you.~
@6 = ~What you know about auction.~
@7 = ~I want to ask about Vengaul.~
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~NP: I have no answer. Even though Im in the worst position, I have to trust that you wont harm me. I am Daranay, and I count on your mercy. I hoped Vengaul sent you, but I have no word from him. His auction did not take place.~ /*I am Dara'nei, and I am at your mercy. I'd hoped you were sent by Vengaul, but I haven't heard from him. His auction was called off.*/
@10 = ~NP: I cannot fight you, nor can I fight those who held me captive before. At least they had their reasons. And I know very little about you. I am Daranay, and I count on your mercy. I hoped Vengaul sent you, but I have no word from him. His auction did not take place.~ /*I can't fight you any more than I could my previous captors. At least they had reason to hold me. I know very little about you.*/
@11 = ~Very well. As I said, my name is Dara'nei. I am... in service to Vengaul Bloodsail, the Scarlet Blade and foil of Lord Nasher Alagondar.~
@12 = ~Why were you imprisoned here?~
@13 = ~I have a question first, if you don't mind? Who do you serve? I won't say anything if you intend to use it against people I care about.~
@14 = ~I am acting as a guard under Aribeth and Nasher.~
@15 = ~Perhaps I'm here to kill you. Perhaps I haven't decided yet.~
@16 = ~That is none of your business.~
@17 = ~More than I care to, at this point. I wish Vengaul had never found that creature. It has caused no end of trouble.~
@18 = ~What creature do you mean?~
@19 = ~Back to my previous questions.~
@20 = ~Vengaul Bloodsail, the Scarlet Blade. He is the former leader of the mutinous Bloodsailors, and he is my betrothed. We have been apart for far too long.~
@21 = ~Why have the Bloodsailors mutinied?~
@22 = ~Where is Vengaul Bloodsail now?~
@23 = ~Farewell. I will remain here. Vengaul will find me when the time is right to do so. If his game doesn't get even further out of hand...~
@24 = ~NP: These were Kalliks people. He was Vengauls lieutenant, and he wanted them to interrogate me and find out where Vengaul was hiding. It may seem that Kallik no longer wants to pursue my Vengaul, but I dont think he got that far.~ /*These were Callik's men. He was Vengaul's Lieutenant, and he wanted them to interrogate me and find out where Vengaul is hiding.*/
@25 = ~I see. I begin to understand what your interest in Vengaul and his Bloodsailors may be. Ask your questions. I will try to answer.~
@26 = ~NP: Then why did you save me? You may not know the answer yourself, but I cannot trust a man who openly threatens me. If thats your intention, I wont tell you more. I can sacrifice my miserable life to keep my lover, Vengaul, out of harms way.~ /*If that is your attitude then I refuse to say any more. I cannot allow my petty life to endanger my beloved Vengaul.*/
@27 = ~NP: How can I trust you if you dont want to be polite to me? Am I asking too much? If thats your intention, I wont tell you more. I can sacrifice my miserable life to keep my lover, Vengaul, out of harms way.~ /*If that is your attitude then I refuse to say any more. I cannot allow my petty life to endanger my beloved Vengaul.*/
@28 = ~NP: Vengaul said it was a Waterdeep cockatrice and that it had something to do with the plague. He even claimed it was part of the cure. He found him on the streets while the city guards were dealing with the plague and what had happened at the Academy. If not for him, the cockatrice would have disappeared. He wanted to make sure the creature would end up in the right hands, but first he decided to invite Lord Nasher to this auction. For Vengaul, it was just a game.~ /*He was going to make sure it was returned to the appropriate city officials, but first he would invite Lord Nasher to this "auction." It was a game to Vengaul.*/
@29 = ~Lord Nasher? Why would he come?~
@30 = ~I will answer if I am able.~
@31 = ~NP: Looks like they got tired of Vengaul. His methods of doing business are sometimes... difficult to understand. They appreciate his grandiose plans less than before. He always emphasized that everything should be done with style, but now all they need is money.~ /*They don't respect his grandiose plans like they used to. He has always stressed how things should be done with style, but now they just want profit.*/
@32 = ~NP: Who is leading the uprising?~ /*What is going on in Luskan?*/
@33 = ~NP: I cant say for sure, but hes an old, hardened pirate. He said Ill know where to find him, and I have a few thoughts about it. Vengaul is on the run, heading to where he thinks hell be safe. Either the Silver Sails or the Aqueducts. It seems to me that from both of these places you can get into his underground treasury.~ /*Vengaul is on the run, so he'll go to where he thinks he's safe. He'll either go to the Silver Sails or the Aqueducts. I think both places lead to an underground cache of his.*/
@34 = ~If you help me find him, I will spare his life.~
@35 = ~I want to find him. I can't promise he'll be safe.~
@36 = ~Tell me where he is or I will kill you!~
@37 = ~NP: These two are old rivals. They were always looking for ways to hurt each other. Vengaul believed that Nasher could not get past this case. You see, Vengaul wanted Nasher to come to this stupid tavern and admit to everyone that he had made a mistake, that he needed Vengaul. Then he was going to give the cockatrice. All this was a game for him.~ /*See, Vengaul wanted Nasher to have to come to this stupid little tavern and admit in front of everyone that he had been outdone, that he needed Vengaul.*/
@38 = ~Idiot! He was playing with people's lives!~
@39 = ~This game of his would not have pleased his Bloodsailors.~
@40 = ~NP: He plays with lives all the time, just like Nasher. This is what all rulers do. Only this time the stakes were too high. You see, the people of Vengaul never delivered the message to Lord Nasher. Whats more, the lieutenant he trusted the most plotted to kill him. All plans are thwarted.~ /*See, Vengaul's men never sent the message to Lord Nasher. Instead, his most trusted lieutenant plotted to kill him. It's all a mess now.*/
@41 = ~NP: No, this game with Nasher took on a slightly more serious character than he wished. This time the stakes were too high. You see, the people of Vengaul never delivered the message to Lord Nasher. Whats more, the lieutenant he trusted the most plotted to kill him. All plans are thwarted.~ /*See, Vengaul's men never sent the message to Lord Nasher. Instead, his most trusted lieutenant plotted to kill him. It's all a mess now.*/
@42 = ~Vengaul would have given the creature back. He's not the kind to let innocents suffer. It just got out of hand.~
@43 = ~NP: Kallik, lieutenant of Vengaula. He did not approve of this auction, so now he is trying to seize power over the Bloody Sailors. He does not appreciate stylish combinations at all. Kallik will kill Vengaul if he finds him. Under his leadership, the &quot;Bloody Sailors&quot; will become even more terrible. Vengaul tried to be civil.~ /*Callik, Vengaul's lieutenant. He didn't approve of this auction, so now he's trying to seize the Bloodsailors for his own. He doesn't appreciate artful schemes.*/
@44 = ~Where Callik now?~
@45 = ~I want to believe. He really did mean for his auction to help... he just wanted the right amount of flash as well. Very well... find him.~
@46 = ~So you hope to entice me by saying you may or may not kill him? I suppose it is the only honesty I have seen today.~
@47 = ~NP: If youre the type who can do that, youll kill me too! I will not betray my beloved Vengaul! I dont know how to get to the Aqueducts, and I wont give you my honey... that is, I wont help you get to the Silver Sails!~ /*I don't know how to enter the Aqueducts and I won't give you my k... I mean, I won't help you get into the Silver Sails!*/
@48 = ~He couldn't wait for his men to finish with me. He's probably made a guess as to where Vengaul is, and has gone to try and find him.~
@49 = ~NP: Take this medallion. It was his gift. He said it was the key, and that with this key I could enter the Silver Sails if I wanted to find it. &quot;Silver Sails&quot; are located in the east of the central part of the Port area. There is a passage down there. Vengaul says its a safe place... for him, anyway.~ /*The Silver Sails is in the west central area of the Docks. There's a passage inside. Vengaul said it is safe... for him, at least.*/
@50 = ~NP: You have already received my medallion. Vengaul said it was the key that would allow me to enter the Silver Sails if I needed to find it. &quot;Silver Sails&quot; are located in the east of the central part of the Port area. There is a passage down there. Vengaul says its a safe place... for him, anyway.~ /*The Silver Sails is in the west central area of the Docks. There's a passage inside. Vengaul said it is safe... for him, at least.*/
@51 = ~You have returned. What more can I tell you? What more do you think I know?~ [NWDOOR52]
@52 = ~Who is it now? More people to threaten me? I shouldn't have said anything. I just hoped someone would help... but I can't trust anyone with Vengaul gone!~ [NWDOOR50]
