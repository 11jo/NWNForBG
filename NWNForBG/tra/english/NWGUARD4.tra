@0 = ~NP: Greetings,<SIRMAAM> ! The Howling Death has claimed many lives outside this gate. The port has always been a dangerous area, but we are now restricting access there by order of Lady Aribeth. I assume you have the proper authorization to break the quarantine and enter the area? I don't want to keep you in the stench of burning corpses any longer than I have to.~ /*Hail, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Docks have always been dangerous but now we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders.*/
@1 = ~Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.~
@2 = ~What kind of clearance do I need?~
@3 = ~Why do I need clearance?~
@4 = ~Sorry, no.~
@5 = ~Aye, there was word she'd be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?~
@6 = ~Could you answer some questions about the Docks district?~
@7 = ~I've got some general questions that need answers...~
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~We're under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you'll have to remain in the Core.~
@10 = ~NP: Look, Howling Death is no joke. I don't even want to think about how many people died. They say even Lord Nasher himself fell ill. We don't have a cure - not yet - so we're doing the best we can. We restrict movement, prevent crowds. In other words... you'd better have permission.~ /*We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.*/
@11 = ~Then don't waste my time.~
@12 = ~I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.~
@13 = ~Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~What do you know of the Wailing Death?~
@15 = ~Are you familiar with Lady Aribeth?~
@16 = ~Be careful. There's plenty of danger afoot.~
@17 = ~NP: Yeah, my friend Haggard was on night duty at the Academy when the creature caravan arrived. We found him in the morning, with his throat cut, next to empty cages. He held tightly in his hand the symbol of Helm, the patron god of all of us guards. So we buried him... to honor him.~ /*Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages.*/
@18 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@19 = ~Do you know anything else about what happened that night?~
@20 = ~Too little to cure it, too much to live without fear. Our only hope is to find those Waterdhavian creatures. Without them, every last one of us is dead.~
@21 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?~
@22 = ~I'm interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.~
@23 = ~Can't say I know her as well as Abbot Fenthick, har har! But, aye, she has been a pillar of this community since she was knighted.~
@24 = ~Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?~
@25 = ~Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?~
@26 = ~NP: Most of all, Lady Aribeth herself knows this. She has a kind soul and is deadly smart. Good thing she's leading the search. Do you need anything else?~ /*The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search.*/
@27 = ~NP: I have a few questions about the waterfront.~ /*I have some questions about the Peninsula district.*/
@28 = ~NP: The rest, as they say, is history. The Waterdeep creatures abducted from their cages have disappeared into the night, and now none of us knows where they hide. Do you need anything else?~ /*The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all.*/
@29 = ~NP: Perhaps you should see the helmite, Dester. He's new here, but he's risking his own health by dispensing Helm's blessings on those afflicted by the pestilence. Do you need anything else?~ /*You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck.*/
@30 = ~NP: I have lost half of my family. I remain a guard in their memory. Do you need anything else?~ /*Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory.*/
@31 = ~NP: If you want gossip about Lady Aribeth, you'd better talk to Mister Fentik. They're supposed to get married this summer, you know... Do you need anything else?~ /*If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know...*/
@32 = ~NP: I'm afraid not. We should not get into the personal affairs of a person, especially in such sad times. Do you need anything else?~ /*I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this.*/
@33 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
@34 = ~Is there any way I can help out in there?~
@35 = ~How bad is it in there?~
@36 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Docks district?~
@37 = ~Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?~
@38 = ~I don't know if there's much left to do. There was some trouble with a pirate group, but that's all over with. It's quiet now.~
@39 = ~Well, you can report in to the Gate Guard on the other side. Maybe he'll know something about the... uh, I probably shouldn't be talking about that.~
@40 = ~Look, I'm here to help, remember?~
@41 = ~NP: Actually, it's all quiet there now. There was some trouble with the Blood Sailors, but it's all over now. I don't know all the details, but they've already figured it out. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Actually, it's pretty quiet now. There was some trouble with the Bloodsailors, but that's all over with. I don't know much about what happened, but it's done.*/
@42 = ~It's pretty bad - I certainly wouldn't go in unequipped. I'd hide any valuables if I were you, too. In fact, it's safe to say the criminals have all but taken over the entire district. We guards do our best, but we just don't have the numbers.~
@43 = ~NP: Well, the main attraction is the Sidi Tavern right in the middle of the northern wall. She is kept by old Jim Sidi. The Golden Apple Inn is located southwest of it. If you are interested in a shop, then there is nothing better in the area than &quot;Twenty-in-a-quiver&quot;, it is in the southeast of the tavern of old Sidi. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Well, the biggest landmark is the Seedy Tavern up against the north wall, run by old Jim Seedy. The Golden Apple Inn is a little southwest of it.*/
@44 = ~NP: I guess you're right... Actually, the Bloody Sailors, the local pirate guild, have been really active lately. What exactly they are up to, no one knows, but it is clearly a big deal... If you want to know more about it, I advise you to talk to the guardian of the waterfront gate. He has the latest information, whatever it may be. Would you like to know something else?~ /*I suppose you're right... Apparently there's been increasing activity from the Bloodsailors, a local pirate's guild. What they're up to is anybody's guess but it's something big...*/
@45 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Peninsula district?~
@46 = ~NP: Greetings,<SIRMAAM> ! The Howling Death has claimed many lives outside this gate. The peninsula is a dangerous area, we are currently restricting access there by order of Lady Aribeth, but you may pass.~ /*Hail, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Peninsula is a dangerous place and we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders.*/
@47 = ~NP: Greetings,<SIRMAAM> ! The Howling Death has claimed many lives outside this gate. The peninsula was a dangerous area, but now there is nothing to do there. The jailbreak is already sorted out, as far as I know.~ /*Hail, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Docks have always been dangerous but now we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders.*/
