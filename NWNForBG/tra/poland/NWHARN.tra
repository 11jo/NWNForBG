@0 = ~Stop right where you are, citizen. Commoners are not allowed to enter the Blacklake district.~
@1 = ~I am a member of the city guard under Aribeth's command.~
@2 = ~You will let me pass or I'll get very angry, fool.~
@3 = ~Why is it closed off?~ 
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Hmmph. The city guard has so many new recruits, I can't even keep up. I think I heard of you, though.~
@6 = ~I've been commanded to find the Waterdhavian creatures. Have you heard anything about them?~
@7 = ~Anything of interest I should know about in Blacklake?~
@8 = ~I need some directions.~
@9 = ~Let me through the gate, then.~
@10 = ~Did you not hear what I said? Only guards and nobles are allowed into the Blacklake area. Period. Now begone.~
@11 = ~Seeing as I am under Aribeth's personal command, you may want to re-think that tone.~
@12 = ~Fine, I'm going.~ 
@13 = ~To keep the plague from reaching Neverwinter's most prominent citizens. So far we've been successful. That will change, of course, if we start letting every peasant that approaches the gate through. So return whence you came.~ 
@14 = ~Yes, yes. On your way, then.~
@15 = ~I just heard that they're supposed to cure the plague or somesuch. I think it'd be a desperate fool who'd believe that. Monsters don't cure plagues.~
@16 = ~Have you heard any rumors about where they might be?~
@17 = ~Have you heard anything at all about the creatures?~
@18 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@19 = ~Well, there's that whole situation with Meldanen. Glad he isn't my problem. He's a strange one.~
@20 = ~Who is Meldanen?~
@21 = ~Anyone you know of in the Blacklake district who needs help?~
@22 = ~Are there any places of interest in the Blacklake district that I should visit?~
@23 = ~Where do you need to go?~
@24 = ~Where is the nearest tavern?~
@25 = ~Where is the nearest temple?~
@26 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@27 = ~Oh, the gate is already open. Just head on through.~
@28 = ~Sorry. No tales of monsters running about the district. Not that I've heard, anyway.~
@29 = ~Maybe you have heard of someone who might know more? Someone who's acting strangely.~
@30 = ~So, none of the nobles have reported seeing anything strange?~
@31 = ~Only that there was some accident when they were brought in, and now they're fled or lost or something. We aren't supposed to panic people by talking about that, though.~
@32 = ~Don't you find it sort of strange that the 'accident' happened as soon as the creatures made it into the city?~
@33 = ~Have you heard any leads on who might have been responsible for the 'accident'?~
@34 = ~Ahh, it's not worth worrying about. He's been taken care of, I hear. He was the main problem in Blacklake, as far as I'm concerned. It's pretty quiet now. Anything else you needed to know?~ 
@35 = ~You know good places to go here?~
@36 = ~Hmph. It's just a district of rich nobles who aren't even suffering from the plague like the rest of the city. I wouldn't worry too much about them, myself. Although I did hear tell that old Samuel went missing last week. No trace of him. Poor sod probably fell into the lake.~ 
@37 = ~Who's Samuel?~
@38 = ~You could always visit the zoo. It's run by some of the nobility and there is quite a selection of exotic animals.~
@39 = ~Try the Board Laid Bare. It's just north of here and should have everything you need. Anything else?~ 
@40 = ~Not many shops in the area. Err... I guess you could try the Board Laid Bare. It's a tavern just north of here.~
@41 = ~Fine. Just don't make any trouble in the district.~
@42 = ~Acting strangely? Well... I suppose Meldanen would certainly qualify, although acting strange is nothing new for him. He's a wizard, they say... sort of an odd bird amongst the nobility.~
@43 = ~Well, it's not as if they come out to the gate to gossip with me and have tea, you know. Most of them are huddled in their big mansions terrified that the plague's going to enter Blacklake regardless of what we do. But no... like I said, I've heard no stories of any strange monsters in Blacklake. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@44 = ~Yeah, sure, but what does that mean to me? That all happened in the City Core, long ways from here. I don't really want to talk about this anymore. It's not really my business. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@45 = ~I'm not really privy to that kind of information. I haven't a clue. Something else?~
@46 = ~What else do you want to know?~
@47 = ~All right, I guess there's no harm. It's not like I'm going to be struck by a lightning bolt or anything, heh. Fact is, Meldanen's been hoarding food. Or so claims Formosa, one of the louder noblewomen in Blacklake. She says the food should be used to feed the city, wants to force the sorcerer to give it up. She's been stirring up quite a bit of trouble over it.~ 
@48 = ~Sorry, but I'm not risking that sorcerer finding out I've been chatting about him. Better a quiet mouse than a loud toad, you know. If you want to know more about it, you should talk to Formosa. You'll hear her screeching soon enough, I'd think, if you go near the district's main square. I wouldn't mind someone trying to rein her in, myself. Anything else you needed to know?~ 
@49 = ~I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell someone. Especially a pretty lass like yourself... Sune knows I don't, uh... well, nevermind. Fact is, Meldanen's been hoarding food. Or so claims Formosa, one of the louder noblewomen in Blacklake. She says the food should be used to feed the city, wants to force the sorcerer to give it up. She's been stirring up quite a bit of trouble over it.~ 
@50 = ~Oh, just one of the older guards. I hear Thurin's been looking for him, though. If you're really interested you could talk to him... he'll be patrolling about, no doubt. Patrolling the tavern, that is. The Board Laid Bare is where Thurin spends his off-hours.~ 
@51 = ~There are no temples in the Blacklake district. Nobility doesn't have time to be pious. Anything else?~ 
@52 = ~But, he's no longer a concern. I heard someone put him in his place, or something. The Blacklake is really quiet now. Is there something else you need, then?~
@53 = ~People have been saying that Meldanen's hoarding food. Some think that he should share some of it with the common folk. I don't know. I wouldn't go messing with Meldanen, myself. Is there something else you need, then?~ 
@54 = ~He's one of the noblemen, supposedly a wizard. Scary reputation. I, uh... probably shouldn't say much more than that, though.~
@55 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@56 = ~Come now, handsome. You can tell little old me.~
@57 = ~If you want to know more about it, you should talk to Formosa. You'll hear her screeching soon enough, I'd think, if you go near the district's main square. I wouldn't mind someone trying to rein her in, myself. Anything else you needed to know?~ 
@58 = ~Greetings to you. I swear, I've seen more traffic just recently than since the plague began.~
@59 = ~Not much reason for you to be here, though. I hear the Blacklake is quiet now. There was some trouble with some nobles stealing food or something, but that's over with. Maybe you had something to do with that? Good on you, if you did.~ 
@60 = ~The gate is already open if you need to enter.~
@61 = ~You are here on militia business, I assume? Nobody else comes through this area except us guards.~
@62 = ~Fare you well. Perhaps we'll speak again.~
