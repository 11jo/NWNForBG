@86241 = ~Ring of Wizardry: Evermemory
Long ago, a grand wizard from Amn was rumored to have defied Mystra's limitations on the magical arts. Legends spoke of this wizard being able to cast spells without the limitation of memorization. In the end it was found that his powers stemmed from the several magical rings that he had made for himself. His proclaimed "everlasting memory" was a hoax, though his rings continue to be one of the most sought after items in the realms.

@86242 = ~Two-handed Sword +3: "The World's Edge"
This is a legendary weapon of heroic proportions, especially among the far-northern tribes of barbarians. Champion after champion has wielded this blade against countless enemies, and the blood it has spilled could fill a small sea. History will not admit that such a blade could be forged and each consecutive owner seems to tie its origin to whatever creation myth they believe. The most grandiose of these tales is that of a great chieftain who sailed to the cliffs that supposedly bordered the world. There he reached into the void, and his will shaped the blade from nothing. Whatever the truth, in the right hands this sword is a fearsome thing.

@88751 = ~HEALER SEHANINE:
The Church of Sehanine is shrouded in mystery, and little is known of its mysterious hierarchy. Sehanine priests are the seers and healers of elven society. They serve as spiritual protectors to elves and half elves who seek to undertake journeys in search of enlightenment to rise above their current existence. Sehanine priests pray when the moon is visible in the sky. Sehanine devotees celebrate numerous church festivals, each tied to the position of different celestial bodies, especially moon phases and eclipses. A Sehanine healer specializes exclusively in healing fellow humans, and is resistant to the negative effects of poisons and diseases. They usually spend little time fighting and training, so they cannot boast of their strength and agility.

Advantages:
- Innate ability "Healing Touch" at level 1
- Innate ability "Slow Poison" at levels 1, 3
- Innate ability "Neutralize Poison" at levels 5, 9, 12

@88916 = ~Blacklake: Unrest

A noble by the name of Formosa harangues the crowd gathered in the Blacklake's central square. She claims that, from behind his well-guarded gates, the sorcerer, Meldanen, is hoarding food from the plaguestruck. Not only has she demanded the key to the warehouse where he has secured his grain, she has also called for his death. One of the sorcerer's teeth is of pure silver and she will gladly accept it as evidence of the deed.~
@88930 = ~Blacklake: Unrest

Any task that Formosa might have wanted completed has been indefinitely postponed. She is now dead.~
@89019 = ~Blacklake: Unrest

Formosa's thirst for Meldanen's blood and hunger for his grain have both been sated. His silver tooth and the key to his warehouse have been given to her.~
@89024 = ~Blacklake: Unrest

The key to Meldanen's warehouse has been delivered to Formosa, but she has been told in no uncertain terms that Meldanen will not be killed. She will have to be content that half her goal has been achieved.~
@89305 = ~Blacklake: Killing Formosa

Desperation is the hallmark of a good bargain. It seems the sorcerer Meldanen wants to turn the tables on the rabble-rouser, Formosa. While she's been calling publicly for his death in the district square, Meldanen has put out a more private (and also more lucrative) offer on her own life.~
@89369 = ~Blacklake: Killing Formosa

Lady Formosa is dead at the request of Meldanen the sorcerer. He has given her assassins their wage and all that remains is to sweep all further talk of it under the carpet where it belongs.~
@89667 = ~Blacklake: Samuel's Rescue

Thurin, a militia officer in the Blacklake District, has offered a reward for the safe return of one of his men. The lost soldier, Samuel, was a close friend of Thurin's and his failure to report back following a recent inspection assignment has caused the officer no small amount of worry.~
@89700 = ~Blacklake: Samuel's Rescue

Samuel, a militia soldier previously reported as 'missing in action,' was recently freed from his captivity within Meldanen's estate in the Blacklake District. Grateful for his rescue, he will be returning to file a report with his commanding officer, Thurin, at the Board Laid Bare tavern. Those responsible for his rescue are encouraged to speak with Thurin regarding their reward.~
@89812 = ~Blacklake: Samuel's Rescue

Thurin, a militia officer in the Blacklake District, has rewarded the adventurers who rescued Samuel from his imprisonment in the Meldanen estate. Word of their assistance will be passed on to Lady Aribeth who will no doubt be pleased with their admirable service.~
@89835 = ~Wailing Death and the Waterdhavian creatures

As the Wailing Death spread across Neverwinter, it was soon apparent that it was not a natural affliction. To fortify the city and aid in investigating the plague, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande called for all adventurers of promise to attend the Neverwinter Academy, and also sought help from some of the greatest wizards in the Realms, including the great archmage of Waterdeep, Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun.
Arunsun sent a collection of magical creatures to the city, with instructions on how they might be used as reagents in a potential cure. The beasts were stored at the Academy, and with the most promising recruits graduating, the site became too tempting a target for Neverwinter's unseen enemy. In the ensuing attack, all but a handful of students were killed, and the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night.

With the viciousness of the still unknown enemy proven, Lady Aribeth called for the survivors to do what they could to find the Waterdhavian creatures, and gather any information on the suspicious origins of the plague. Lady Aribeth hopes that we will return the beasts to her at the Hall of Justice, where she waits with her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne. We also shoud seek clues about what has caused the plague. Aribeth suggested that the investigation begin in the Peninsula district.~
@89836 = ~Wailing Death and the Waterdhavian creatures

Significant strides have been made in the fight against the Wailing Death and those behind it. Now three of the Waterdhavian creatures - sent by Khelben Arunsun and lost in the attack on the Neverwinter Academy - have been recovered, and have been delivered to Lady Aribeth in the Hall of Justice. She awaits the return of the single remaining beast in the company of her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne. Once all have been found, the ritual to create the cure can commence.~
@89868 = ~Wailing Death and the Waterdhavian creatures

There has been great progress in the fight against the Wailing Death and those behind it. All of the Waterdhavian creatures - sent by Khelben Arunsun and lost in the attack on the Neverwinter Academy - have been recovered and delivered to Lady Aribeth in the Hall of Justice. Now that everything is in place, Lady Aribeth awaits her recruits at the Hall of Justice. She will take them to the ritual as soon as they are ready, where they can witness the creation of the cure.~

@90834 = ~Cloaktower: Membership

I have applied for membership into the local guild of magic, the Many-Starred Cloak. In the Cloaktower, their glistening guild hall in the City Core, the guild leader, Eltoora Sarptyl, bestowed upon me a key to the guild's various laboratories throughout the city. Each is marked with a sundial and from them I am to retrieve four items: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. She also warned to expect dangers along my path, as the four items do not go unguarded. Once I have obtained all four items, I am to present myself to Eltoora for whatever other tests she may deem necessary.~

In the Cloaktower, their glistening guild hall in the City Core, the guild leader, Eltoora Sarptyl, took from me four items: a bit of clay, a flask of water, a puff of fog, and a bit of kindling wood. Now another test awaits me, I should destroy a golem.~
@90866 = ~Cloaktower: Membership

Having passed Eltoora's test, I have now received the mantle of the Many-Starred Cloak and have become a member of the guild. Aside from the prestige and other benefits, it will also grant me more complete access to their stores of magical supplies, that I might make a better practice of my craft.~
@91344 = ~I suspect in practice we are similar to your own Order, though our beliefs and values may be somewhat different.~
@92485 = ~The Search for the Cult

Through our valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be based somewhere north of Neverwinter. Lady Aribeth has moved the base of her investigation to the township of Port Llast, northernmost member of the Lords' Alliance. She is waiting for us in this city.~
@92603 = ~The City Core: Animal Rescue

Nyatar, a druid beneath the great tree in the City Core, claims that animals in a Blacklake District zoo are being ill-treated and require rescue. Nyatar has provided a Teleport Via Plants scroll which is to be used on one of the trees near the zoo. Once broken from their confinement, any animals that are led to the tree will use it to teleport to safety at Nyatar's side.~

Once broken from their confinement, any animals that are led to the tree will use it to teleport to safety at Nyatar's side. In order for us to talk to animals, we need to put on the Amulet of communication with animals, which Niatar also kindly provided us with.~
@92651 = ~The City Core: Animal Rescue

Nyatar is pleased. All of the captive animals have been rescued from the zoo and now benefit from his druidic protection.~
@92654 = ~The City Core: Animal Rescue

Nyatar was devastated, an understandable reaction to the deaths of all the animals in the Neverwinter Blacklake zoo.~
@92656 = ~The City Core: Animal Rescue

Nyatar was grateful for the release of the animals from the Neverwinter Blacklake zoo, but was also saddened by the loss of some of them. At least they are no longer caged.~
@92668 = ~Temple of Tyr: Never's Tomb

Judge Oleff of the Hall of Justice seeks the tomb of Neverwinter's founder, Lord Halueth Never, in the hopes that it might buoy the people's spirits and perhaps unearth some artifacts that might be of assistance against the Wailing. His assistant, Briley, waits by the recently discovered tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade, one of Halueth's adventuring companions, and tells a sad tale indeed - like so many others in the city, the entire excavation team responsible for the discovery has passed away of the Wailing Death. The only known documentation of their discovery is a journal left by one of the team members. Briley has secured it in a chest outside of Miaslaznia's tomb and has encouraged interested parties to examine it in the hopes of deciphering the possible location of other tombs. Miaslaznia's tomb can be reached via the cellars of a house on the east side of the Peninsula District.~
@92702 = ~Temple of Tyr: Never's Tomb

Judge Oleff of the Hall of Justice seeks the tomb of Neverwinter's founder, Lord Halueth Never, in the hopes that it might buoy the people's spirits and perhaps unearth some artifacts that might be of assistance against the Wailing. He has asked us to present ourselves to his assistant, Briley, who currently stands guard over the recently discovered tomb of Miaslaznia Fairblade, one of Halueth's adventuring companions. Miaslaznia's tomb can be reached via the cellars of a house on the east side of the Peninsula District.~
@92718 = ~Temple of Tyr: Never's Tomb

All of the artifacts to be found in the tombs of Halueth Never and his companions have been accounted for. Unfortunately, they are all in the hands of a rival church. Oleff was understandably disturbed by this, but there is little he, or anyone, can do.~
@92731 = ~Temple of Tyr: Never's Tomb

All three artifacts from Lord Never's tomb have been returned to Judge Oleff at the Hall of Justice. They should be of great assistance in bouying the spirits of the plague-struck city and may prove to be of some practical benefit as well.~
@92734 = ~Temple of Tyr: Never's Tomb

All of the artifacts to be found in the tombs of Halueth Never and his companions have been accounted for. Unfortunately, some of them are now in the hands of a rival church. Oleff was understandably disturbed by this, though there is little he, or anyone, can do. For whatever reason, an evil hand had a part in this quest.~
@92742 = ~Moonstone Mask: Art Theft

Ophala Cheldarstorn of the Moonstone Mask has requested the theft of a series of art objects from people who have been critical of her establishment. One of them, a valuable urn possessed by a man named Hodge, is somewhere in the Blacklake District. Another, a portrait of the late Sir Reginald Rumbottom III, is said to be hidden in the Rumbottom estate in the Blacklake as well. The third is a statuette of the female form, reputed to be in the Docks District estate of a certain Androd Golden. Should any of these be 'acquired,' Ophala will pay handsomely for them.~
@92799 = ~Moonstone Mask: Art Theft

Ophala Cheldarstorn of the Moonstone Mask is very pleased. She had requested the theft of a series of art objects from people who have been critical of her establishment and all of those hits have been carried out with great success.~
@93969 = ~Peninsula: Prison Break

There's been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Gate Captain Kipp recommends talking to Sedos Sebile to determine the best means of getting into the Prison and helping out. She's headquartered in the district's southeast corner.~
@94004 = ~Peninsula: Prison Break

There's been a prison break in the Peninsula District. Aside from the chaos in the district, itself, former prisoners now patrol the prison interior while the former guards beg for rescue from the prison cells. Sedos Sebile, Commander of militia operations in the Peninsula, has requested assistance. We need to get inside that prison and figure out what the hell is going on down there.~
@94059 = ~Peninsula: Prison Break

With the death of the strange creature that had consumed the Head Gaoler's once-noble mind, the Peninsula District has been returned to safety, at least from this immediate threat. The Wailing Death still hangs heavily over the place, however.~
@94788 = ~A Devil's Deal

It stands there, flaunting its evil, with all the time in the world. Chaohinon of the Void is the name of it. Apparently the False Helmites summoned it to crush the Guardian Spirit that watches over Helm's Hold. The demon has done just that, but has not been set free, and now wants someone to find a Black Grimoire and finish the ritual to set it loose upon the world. It promises adequate reward, but they always do, don't they?~
@94808 = ~A Devil's Deal

Chaohinon of the Void has been unleashed to inflict its evil upon the world, an act that will no doubt bring consequences.~
@94876 = ~A Devil's Deal

Chaohinon of the Void has been banished back to the dark hells that spawned him. In his place has risen the Guardian Spirit of Helm's Hold. The demon had thought the Spirit destroyed, but it was only suppressed beneath the invading evil. Now it is free to aid in defending against Desther and the cult that has ravaged the Hold so severely.~
@95176 = ~Beggar's Nest: Undead Infestation

The Beggar's Nest needs to be explored and any information regarding who has caused the undead infestation should be reported back to Harben Ashensmith and Drake in the Shining Serpent Inn. Harben will reward people who help.~
@95191 = ~Beggar's Nest: Undead Infestation

The Beggar's Nest needs to be explored and any information regarding who has caused the undead infestation should be reported back to Harben Ashensmith and Drake in the Shining Serpent Inn. Harben will reward people who help. It has been suggested that Krestal and Jemanie may have information regarding some strange local events. Krestal lives west of the Helmite temple, while Jemanie lives in the northwest.~
@95309 = ~Beggar's Nest: Undead Infestation

Harben Ashensmith has been told of the destruction of Gulnan, the Waterdhavian Yuan-Ti that caused the undead infestation in the Beggar's Nest. Her heart is an important component in the spell that will hopefully cure the Wailing Death.~

Through our valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be based somewhere north of Neverwinter.

With the city's long quarantine lifted and her lover, Fenthick, hanged, Lady Aribeth has moved the base of her investigation to the township of Port Llast, northernmost member of the Lords' Alliance. There she has once again put out a call to adventurers to seek out the cult's corruption wherever it may lie. The cult's base must be discovered and its leaders brought to justice. Standing guard over Aribeth at the local mercenary barracks is Aarin Gend, a Spymaster in the service of the Alliance. He has explained that the best lead for locating the cult lies to the north of Port Llast, in a series of caves that lie in the hills. They are inhabited by humanoid monsters that have been performing unusual raids. Should this avenue of investigation not prove worthwhile, the spymaster suggests searching either Luskan to the north, Neverwinter Wood to the east or the wildlands of the South Road. Two separate and corroborating pieces of evidence are needed to prove the cult's location.~
@95589 = ~The Search for the Cult

Through our valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, which was tracked down with considerable effort to be based within the Host Tower of the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan.
The leader of the cult, a sorcerer by the name of Maugrim, had engineered a coup to overthrow the order of wizards and bring the majority of its power under the influence of the cult. This power was used to approach other powers in the North and throw the city of Luskan into chaos... all in an effort to build an army that could assault Neverwinter. This army will be led by none other than Lady Aribeth herself... a fallen paladin who has become a blackguard in the service of the same mistress as Maugrim: a strange lizard creature by the name of Morag.

This Morag seeks 'Words of Power'... what they are or what will happen once Morag obtains them is unknown, but they may prove to be the only way to block the great power Maugrim and his cult have already gathered. Time is of the essence. You must bring this information quickly to Aarin Gend at the Temple of Tyr!~

The cult appears to be operating out of the dreaded Host Tower of the Arcane which lies at the heart of the pirate city of Luskan.

The base of operations has been moved to Luskan, and Aarin Gend reported that Aribeth mysteriously disappeared sometime after arrival. Though he felt she may have decided to take vengeance on her own, no time can be spared to search for her, that the adventurers must push on in their efforts against the cult.

A heavy contingent of guards and magical wards prevent unwanted visitors from crossing the bridge to the Host Tower. Aarin Gend has forged the necessary documents which will allow a small group of adventurers to bypass the wards and be passed off as dignitaries visiting the tower.~

Doing so will require the official pass of one of Luskan's High Captains, the city's self-proclaimed pirate kings constantly squabbling over goods and territory within the city walls. The pass has the magical seal of the Arcane Brotherhood, which Aarin Gend hopes to use to make a forgery.~

He has managed to convince an old friend, a sergeant within Luskan's city guard, to allow him and his agents through the gates and into the city. Aarin warns that this is a one-way trip, however. Once inside Luskan, nobody will be able to get back out, so one should only enter Luskan fully-equipped and with no tasks left to be completed.~

He and his daughter are currently staying at an inn in Port Llast, searching for three gems that will help them make the journey home. Unfortunately, the gems are not in the hands of people interested in parting easily with them. 
The first is in the possession of a local wizard by the name of Wanev. He lives in his tower south of town. The second is held by the warrior Zamithra who recently passed through Port Llast on her way to Luskan. The final gem is the personal treasure of Setara, a witch of the Neverwinter Wood.~

Neurik, a priest of Tyr who presides of Port Llast's temple, warns of a terrible tragedy that has befallen some of the town's young men. Sir Karathis Ironheart, a travelling werewolf hunter, enlisted the help of four boys to hunt a foul lycanthrope known only as the Black Wolf. It was a trap, however, and Sir Karathis was himself the Black Wolf. His claws raked the flesh of Bran, Urth, and Geth, infecting them with his dread disease, leaving only the youngest boy, Ander, to escape. Neurik believes that, if found soon enough, the three young men may still be curable by a charm he has concocted. Ander currently spends his days at the Alliance Arms Inn, trying to spread news amongst adventurers of the tragedy that befell his friends. Neurik recommends speaking with the boy to gain an understanding of where those friends may now be hiding.~

With the Wailing's cure and subsequent removal of Neverwinter's quarantine, the wizardess Eltoora has journeyed to Port Llast to provide her services to those searching for the cult responsible. She also comes with ulterior motives, however, as she seeks a collection of ancient tomes from the lost civilization of Imaskar. The five books are said to act as recipes, providing guidance to those undertaking magical experiments. Should any of the tomes be found, she will reward whoever returns them.

Through scrying attempts, she has managed to narrow down the locations of the five tomes of Imaskar. The Tome of Fire and the Tome of Death are both said to be lost in Charwood, while the Tome of Life apparently rests with the corpse of Brother Toras in the cemetery outside the walls of Luskan. The Tome of Ice is housed within a tower south of Port Llast and the last, the Tome of Resonance, lies somewhere along the treacherous road deep into the Neverwinter Woods.~
@96476 = ~Port Llast: The Five Tomes of Imaskar

With the Wailing's cure and subsequent removal of Neverwinter's quarantine, the wizardess Eltoora has journeyed to Port Llast to provide her services to those searching for the cult responsible. She also comes with ulterior motives, however, as she seeks a collection of ancient tomes from the lost civilization of Imaskar. The five books are said to act as recipes, providing guidance to those undertaking magical experiments. All five of these books have been returned to Eltoora and, and the generous reward has been received.~
@96692 = ~Port Llast: Bounty Hunt

Kendrack, head of the mercenary guild and Mayor of Port Llast, has put out a reward for the death of five dangerous prisoners escaped from Waterdeep. They have separated to avoid detection but can all be identified by means of a tattoo on their left ear, marking them as inmates of the Bulwark prison. It is this tattoo that Kendrack wants as evidence of the deed.

Zor, a burly minotaur, is rumored to have been spotted on the north road, near the Green Griffon Inn. Wyvern, an elven ranger with a taste for trickery, will likely have sought refuge in the Neverwinter Wood. Stirge, an egomaniacal gnome, was last sighted on the road south of Port Llast. Delilah, a halfling assassin who once made her home in Luskan, was last seen on the road east of Port Llast. Yesgar, the group's ring-leader and mastermind, remains elusive though Kendrack doubts that he'd stray far.~

It appears that Sir Karathis Ironheart is not the Black Wolf after all. He entered the caves east of the Green Griffon Inn and was ambushed and infected himself.

The boy's life is in great danger and Neurik has given the order to find and destroy Alhelor at once. He would like to see Elchelor's tooth as proof of his death.~

A large book has been discovered in the tower of Karlat Jhareg, one of the two lords of Charwood who currently stand accused by the Guardian Spirit on the castle's main floor.

A demon's influence in these events seems suspicious and well worth investigating, though a re-summoning is no doubt risky business.~
@97833 = ~Charwood: Belial's Tale

The demon Belial, Lord of Fire, has been re-summoned to Castle Jhareg's haunted halls to present further evidence in the case of the brothers Jhareg. According to the demon's account, he lied to Karlat, his original summoner, claiming the slaughter of the village children was necessary if the sorcerer was to become a baelnorn. Belial appears quite proud of this tragic subterfuge, flaunting it readily. He does not fear Judgment, as any return to the Abyss will be a triumphal homecoming for him. It would be wise to consider this evidence carefully.~

Inside the village proper, the townsfolk seem to be lost in a haze of confusion and forgetfulness, repeating their words endlessly into the chill night air.

This made the wizard nervous enough that he jotted down some thoughts on how to close the aperture, if necessary. He notes that he possesses a sphere filled with water from Celestia and a sample of abyssal metal elsewhere in his home. Placed together in the aperture, these would bring about the desired disruption.

@102340 = ~Sword of Nazger~
@102341 = ~This magical item is a long sword made of what appears to be dull, unpolished (and unpolishable) reddish tinted silver.  The blade is regular length for such a weapon, though slightly slimmer than what is normal for a long sword.  The hilt is a seperate piece and of regular steel.  The cross piece looks like two crescent moons each overlapping the other, similar to () overcrossing each other at the ends and the blade coming through the middle gap.  The hilt is also wrapped in a cross-hatched pattern of blue and green wire threads.

The blade was constructed some one-hundred-fifty years ago by a human ranger turned mage from the Archwood area, named Frasfer the Brown.  He and a few companions were keeping guard in the Archwood, when an influx of werewolves caused him to attempt the creation of a magical means to making their elimination easier.  One of his companions was a druid, and the mixing of druidic magic and wizard magic created a blade reknowned for a later owner.

That later owner was Nazger, a soldier of Sembia who found the sword fifty years ago.  He used it to find wererats that were murdering people in Highmoon, a city just northwest of the Archwood.  So Nazger exposed the wererats and killed most of them off.  However, while fighting in the sewers of the city he disappeared.  Nothing was ever again found of Nazger, except his sword.  It was later recognized in the market, but reported too late.  It was sold to a caravan heading to Ordulin.

As Nazgar had no immediate family the city guard did little investigation.  All that was turned up was that a street beggar found the blade in the sewers and thought to sell it for food in the market.  The begger claimed to know nothing else.

The powers of the blade may have become revealed to the caravan and thus kept, or may have remained unknown and sold as merely a silver sword.

The Sword of Nazger is an unintelligent magic blade that is normally +1 to hit/damage, but gives a +3 bonus to hit/damage versus werecreatures of all types.  It also gives the wielder a tingling sensation similar to when one's hand falls asleep when werecreatures are within 60' of the user, though it won't indicate who it is that is a werecreature, nor get more powerful if the werebeast gets closer.   The blade will also appear to have a set of glyphs along the blade if viewed under a full moon.

@102714 = ~NP: Invisible hat~ /*Druid, Interloper*/
@102715 = ~NP: Magical hats can actually be of various kinds. They can expand or narrow depending on the size of the head. Modern fashion dictates its own styles and styles to create types of magical headdresses.~ /*The best way that I can explain their purpose, with brevity, is to compare them to recipe books. These books explain the crafting of magical items.*/
@102716 = ~NP: This ordinary-looking hat has the magical ability to make the wearer invisible. Such things, as a rule, are stored in an inaccessible place and guarded by dark forces, adventurers have to go through many trials or trick such an artifact from sinister evil spirits. The very fact that you were lucky enough to find this magical item in a regular magic shop is a definite stroke of luck. The owner of the hat cannot be detected by magical means, such as the See Invisible spell and searching with magical crystals. In addition, this invisibility hat protects the wearer from the cold.

History records that the rings remained within that family for at least 13 generations, though they were all apparently lost within the space of one. Enmity between the King and the family of the creator may be to blame.*/
@102732 = ~NP: Staff of Aramis~ /*Staff of Armand*/
@102733 = ~NP: On top of this long ebony staff is a large blue crystal that radiates electricity. The staff was created by the powerful mage Aramis, who lived somewhere on an island in the Sea of Rains. However, this staff has not been seen for several generations due to a natural disaster that shook the island. PARAMETERS: Special abilities: 50% chance of dealing 1D8 electrical damage The wielder of the staff gains 50% resistance to electrical attacks. Staff fires lightning once per day Damage: 1D6+2 THAC0: +2 Weight: 7 Strength Needed: 5 Does not use: Monk~ /*In ancient times, the proud and quarrelsome wizard Valmaxian was a man of great power and prominence. He crafted this staff with the aid of a demon, all to win the heart of Chasianna, the daughter of his long-dead master. When the debt came due, the demon demanded Chasianna as his price. In a rage, Valmaxian descended into the Abyss and used the staff to battle the demon and rescue the woman he loved.*/
@102734 = ~NP: Robe of Fortitude~ /*Fortitude*/
@102735 = ~NP: At the beginning of this century, Akarima Tzu, the famous Monk of the Destroyer, entered into a colossal battle with the vicious ice dragon Ingarjak. Despite the physical and spiritual training that allowed him to survive longer than any other mortal, only this clothing gave him the last bit of strength needed to kill the infernal animal. PARAMETERS: Equipment capabilities: Defense class: +2 bonus Restores 1 health point every 6 seconds +15% Resistance to all Blunt, Stab and Slash attacks Weight: 3 Used by: Monks~ /*The Shukenja are a monastic order known for their subtlety and magic power. Though rank-and-file brothers fight with a staff and wear no armor, elite members of the order are known to wear Shukenja Helms into battle to augment their sorcerous abilities.

@102736 = ~NP: Battle Robe of the Archmage~ /*Mage's Battle Robe*/
@102737 = ~NP: Nowhere on earth do wizards who engage in mortal combat have adequate protection. At least that was the case before the creation of the Archmage Battle Robe. Soaked in the blood of many monsters, this garment has never seen the light of the surface. Created by an unknown Archmage, she has been on some strange plane for so long that you can't imagine. This is probably a worthy competitor to Robe Vecna. Better protection for a wizard is hard to come by. PARAMETERS: Equipment Capabilities: Defense Class: +3 bonus THAC0: +3 bonus Health Points: +10 bonus Spell Casting Speed +2 Bonus 5% Physical Damage Resistance Weight: 3 Used by: Mages (single, dual, and multiclass)~ /*Type of Feat: SpellPrerequisite: 21st level, Quicken Spell, Spellcraft 30, ability to cast 9th level spells.

@102739 = ~NP: Order a mage~ /*Mage Robes*/
@102740 = ~NP: The origin of these bracers is not exactly known. There were many rumors about their true whereabouts and origins. However, it is known for certain that these bracers are very old, but the magic cast on them is very strong and is not going to dissipate, unlike many equally ancient artifacts. PARAMETERS: Bonus to the class of defense: +2 Features: Increase the speed of casting spells Weight: 2 Used only by: Mages Bards~ /*Although it appears to be little more than a simple pearl strung upon light chain, this Periapt of Wisdom is a very powerful object. Occasionally crafted by the highest ranking clergy of a church, such objects serve to improve perception and insight, and are often used as meditative tools.*/
@102741 = ~NP: Staff of the Ancients~ /*Old One Warrior*/
@102742 = ~NP: This staff was created by a race known as the Ancients, who existed many hundreds of years ago. Some relics have remained since then, and even the descendants of the Ancients know a little about their properties and capabilities. PARAMETERS: THACO: +3 Damage: 2d4 + 3 Features: +1 to defense class Damage type: crushing Speed factor: 1 Skill type: staff Class: 2-handed Weight: 3 Used by: Mage priests~ /*With the blood of a red dragon coursing through their veins, this sorcerer package will lead to the power of a dragon disciple.
These packages do not give any special abilities to your character, they simply configure your skills and feats so you don't have to and so you may pick the dragon disciple prestige class.*/
@102743 = ~NP: Ring of Unstoppable~ /*Ring of Invisibility*/
@102744 = ~NP: At first glance, this ring is indistinguishable from the usual &quot;Ring of Free Action&quot;, and only the glowing runes engraved on its surface suggest that some unknown master of arcane magic once thoroughly tried to improve its properties. Who he is - hardly anyone will know, as well as who it was intended for. PARAMETERS: Features: The ring's wearer is immune to any effects, magical or otherwise, that affect movement, while still being affected by Haste. This ring has been enchanted so that the beneficial effects gained from the Boots of Speed will be active while the ring is worn.~ /*The half-elf Jasswin is probably the best-known owner of one of these cloaks, since it played a significant part in his ascension to the post of Great Druid. He acquired the cloak after spending a season with no shelter, wanting to "feel the land unhindered." He found the garment before the cold season set in, a gift from the wilds that carried a message both humbling and clear: he could appreciate the rain while still seeking shelter from it.*/
@102745 = ~NP: Lightning Amulet~ /*Amulet of Power*/
@102746 = ~NP: This amulet not only provides full protection against lightning, but also with its help allows you to attack enemies. STATS: Combat Abilities: Lightning 3 times per day Wear Abilities: 100% Electricity Resistance Do not use: Mage Killers~ /*This helm mounts a circlet of blue-green metal around the wearer's forehead.  The circlet is stamped with the blank-scroll symbol of Oghma and grants the wearer insight into the origins of magical creations and spells.*/
@102747 = ~NP: Hurricane +3~ /*Sling +3*/
@102748 = ~NP: The Hurricane is the most user-friendly of all staffs. Not only does it practically not slow down, it also speeds up its owner. The hurricane is made of a steel rod, a staff and two diamonds. The rod is inserted into the staff, and diamonds are fixed at the ends to pierce the strongest armor. Due to the cast of enchantments, the Hurricane is very light in weight. PARAMETERS: Special abilities: Haste +1 attack per round Agility set to 18 Damage: 1D6 + 3 THAC0: +3 Damage type: crushing Weight: 1 Haste factor: 0 Skill type: staves Type: 2-handed Requires: 3 Strength Not used : Monks~ /*This thick shirt of coarse brown horsehair constrains its wearer but provides additional protection from damage.

@102749 = ~NP: Robe of Magical Might~ /*SmallMagic Cauldron*/
@102750 = ~NP: Created by the mages of ancient Netheril, such robes are very rare. This robe gives the wearer full protection against silence spells, and improves spell casting speed. STATS: Permanent: Vocalize Increases your spell casting speed by 3 Weight: 3 Used only by: Mages (multiclass, dual class, or normal mages)~ /*All you have to do is find the proper reagent and place it into the summoning pool, then cast the appropriate spell on the pool. The only problem is, I don't know what reagents or which spell Cyril might have used.*/
@102753 = ~NP: Mantle of the Sovereigns~ /*Conjurer's Robe*/
@102754 = ~NP: The Mantle of Sovereigns has many protective spells cast on it and has been kidnapped many times. It is useless to thieves, so often magicians hired thieves for this black deed. PARAMETERS: Special abilities: +25% to resistance to Fire, Cold, Electricity, Poison and Acid +1 to defense class +1 to all saving throws Weight: 4 Use by: Mages (Single-, double-, multi-classes)~ /*Cloaks of this sort are infused with protective spells, and are among the most popular and numerous magic items on the market. The original design may have originated in the earliest of arcane guilds, but the current makers of these items are varied and widespread.*/
@102755 = ~NP: Robe of High Sorcery~ /*Robes of the Old Order*/
@102756 = ~NP: This powerful item once belonged to Raizen, a powerful archmage who participated in one great magical war, where sorcerers fought against large armies to reserve the right to use magic. This war resulted in terrible devastation, and finally a kind of truce was reached, and there were people with the ability to both fight and conjure. However, Raizen felt that they weren't true magicians, they lacked devotion to the Art, so the items he created could only be worn by truly dedicated sorcerers. PARAMETERS: Defense class: 6 +1 to all saving throws Increases spell casting speed +2 Weight: 3 Used by: Mages of the same class~ /*Type of Feat: ClassPrerequisite: Champion of Torm level 5.
Specifics: The Champion is able to channel a portion of their deities's power once per day giving them a +3 bonus on attack rolls, damage, and saving throws for a number of rounds equal to their Charisma bonus. They also gain damage reduction of 5/+1. The attack and saving throw bonuses increase by +2 at level 10
Use: Selected*/
@102757 = ~NP: wizard hat~ /*Wizard's Grove*/
@102758 = ~NP: Many wizards wear hats, but they can only dream of one like this. This is an artifact of the greatest power. The hat protects its wearer well, both from heat and cold. In addition, he will never be attacked by a summoned demon. The owner of the hat gains some protection from physical attacks and casts his spells much faster. PARAMETERS: Bonus to defense class: 2 Speeds up reading time by 4 Permanent protection from evil Fire and cold resistance +40 Special: The wearer can summon a demon 1 time per day. Weight: 1 Use: Mages (Single, Dual-, and Multi-class)~ /*This thick shirt of coarse brown horsehair constrains its wearer but provides additional protection from damage.

@102770 = ~NP: Blood Iron +4~ /*Blood Frenzy*/
@102771 = ~NP: Bloody Iron, infamous in the frosty North, was made by the evil barbarian shaman Hekedder and presented to his cousin. Over the years, this weapon has been in the hands of many barbarians. Each owner eventually found that because of this sword, everyone began to hate him. Necromancy is so disgusting to the northern tribes that almost everyone knew about the Blood Iron and cursed it. Today, no barbarian wants to touch a terrible weapon and will not even mention its name. The sword is made of rough, poorly finished iron, and small dents and traces of inaccurate hammer blows are visible over the entire surface of the blade. The handle is wrapped in bright red leather. PARAMETERS: Combat Traits: - Each successful strike restores 3 points of health to the wearer THACO: +4 Damage: 1d6+4 (piercing) Speed Factor: 1 Weapon Skill: Shortsword Type: One-Handed Requires: Strength 5 Weight: 3 Cannot Use: Good~ /*Dumal was found in the cells beneath Helm's Hold, where he's been a prisoner since shortly after Desther and his False Helmites arrived. He says that Desther only took the Hold as a staging area, using it to launch an attack on somewhere else, presumably Neverwinter. This was after the plague began, reinforcing the idea that Desther did not start the Wailing, but he did have a vested interest in spreading and prolonging it. Whoever his cult masters are, they wanted as much death to the disease as possible.*/
@102772 = ~NP: Scavenger~ /*Feet*/
@102773 = ~NP: Drow Assassin Mail~ /*Chainmail of Speed*/
@102774 = ~NP: Drow mail is finely crafted, satin black metal mesh that does not burden its wearer in any way. It is similar, but not identical, to magical elven mail. Typically this armor is made for the torso only, as drow elves share a preference for their forest-bound cousins for armor that is adequately protective without being overly heavy or restrictive. The exceptional lightness of this armor allows it to be carried by thieves and warriors/wizards with few restrictions. In addition, drow mail provides a slight increase in resistance to magic and slightly reduces the casting time of all spells while it is worn. Unlike most Dark Elf items, this particular chain mail was not crafted with Adamantine, as it was designed for spies and assassins who regularly travel to the surface. Therefore, it will not disintegrate into dust when exposed to sunlight, but it does not provide as much protection as regular drow armor. STATS: Abilities when worn: The wearer gains +5% Magic Resistance Increases spell casting speed by 1 Thief Ability Penalty Defense Class: 4 Weight: 7 Requirements: 5 Strength Unused by: Druids Mages~ /*Alignment reflects how your character relates to the concepts of good and evil, law and chaos. It can affect how certain NPCs react within the game, and will occasionally determine whether an item can be used or not (some items have alignments of their own, and will not allow a conflict with their user). The main purpose of alignment, however, is to act as a guideline for consistent roleplaying, though it is not set in stone. The alignment of a character can change to match the style in which they are played, if deviation is consistent and serious. All of the nine alignments listed are viable choices for adventurers, though the "evil" variants are more often the domain of villains and monsters.*/

The result is a two-handed ax with amazing properties. It is so easy to handle that even a not very successful hit on the enemy causes significant damage to the enemy and damages the armor.

The putty-like balls at the ends of these crossbow arrows are actually dried sponges found in many of the great lakes in Bitopia. Unnoticed by most experts, these little sponges are able to absorb acid and deposit it in their body without harming themselves. As a result, they were harvested in large numbers and grown as weapons against demons in the Blood War. After several days of a heavy acid diet, the sponges are collected, dried, and covered with a resin that forms a protective layer around the sponge. The sponge is then placed on the arrow head and is ready for use. By hitting the opponent with the right amount of force, the coating is torn, the sponge is released, and the client is merchandised with acid.

@103232 = ~NP: Greater Dispel (Repudiation) Level: 6 Range to Target: In caster's line of sight Duration: Special Cast Time: 5 Area of Coverage: 30-foot cube Saving Throw: Special Greater Dispel removes magical effects from everyone in the area. This includes the effects of spells, potions, and magical items such as wands. Unlike normal dispel magic, this spell removes all protective magical effects, such as stone skin or magical armor or weapons. The chance of a successful dispel is determined by the level of the caster and the level of magic being dispelled. The initial chance of a successful dispel is 50%. For each level of the caster that is greater than the initial dispel level, the chance of a successful dispel is increased by 5%. For each caster level less than the initial dispel level, the chance of success is reduced by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if the caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Likewise, if the caster is 4 levels below the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Accordingly, if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster, the spell will be useless.~ /*Caster Level(s): Wizard / Sorcerer 9Innate Level: 9

Mordenkainen's Disjunction attempts to strip all magical effects from a single target. It can also target a group of creatures, attempting to remove the two most powerful spell effects from each creature. To remove an effect, the caster makes a dispel check of 1d20, +1 per caster level (to a maximum of +40) against a DC of 11 + the spell effect's caster level. In addition to its ability to dispel effects, this spell also strips a single enemy of up to 6 magical defenses or a group of enemies of two spell protections each. Finally, the spell will lower the SR of all creatures within the area of effect by 10.

@103233 = ~NP: The fight begins~ /*But of course.*/
@103234 = ~Former Guard~
@103235 = ~History of the Creator Races~
@103236 = ~In a time when the North was always warm and the seas of the world were deeper, empires of inhuman peoples dominated the lands of Toril. In the elven tradition, these were the days when the Iquar'Tel'Quessir, or creator races, tamed the wilds, built towering cities of stone and glass on the shores of the warm seas, spanned the wilderness with winding roads, and fought wars of extermination - such was their hatred toward each other. These were the Days of Thunder.
First of these ancient creators was a saurian race that built an extensive if short-lived civilization. Its survivors eventually became the naga, lizardfolk, troglodytes, and similar creatures.

Supreme among the creator races were the dragons, powerful enough to raid large cities of the other creator races with impunity. Dragons dominated the surface world, claiming vast areas of territory and battling each other for land, mates, and status. The great drakes only suffered setbacks when lesser races mastered magic, and they remain influential today despite the advances of such rabble.

Developing in the later stages of the civilization of the saurians was a race of amphibious shapechangers that crept onto the land to build their proud cities. These creatures contributed to the downfall of the saurians, but they themselves eventually fell into barbarism under pressure from sahuagin, merfolk, and tritons. The survivors of this race are the locathah and tako in the sea, and doppelgangers on the land.

Least known of the creator races are the sylvan people that populated the forests and other wooded areas, living in harmony with nature and leaving few traces. It is believed that their civilization fragmented after a great plague created by a draconic or demonic power. Their descendants are the sprites, korred, and other small woodfolk that populate secret parts of the Forgotten Realms today.

The last of the creator races, and the one that spent the longest time in a primitive state, are the humans. Always adaptable and ingenious, when circumstances allowed for their rise to prominence, humans make advances with incredible speed and efficiency. Of the five creator races, only they truly have a civilization today. The dragons war with each other as individuals, and the other kinds have vanished from the world.~
@103237 = ~Wars of the Creator Races~
@103238 = ~In the ancient days, before the rise of the created races, great wars were fought by the creator races: the reptile creatures, the amphibians, and the avian peoples. Though most of these wars were fought against other races, many were fought between themselves as well, as they sought to gain dominance over one realm or another.
Only a few tales from this time survive. One recounts a group of reptile creatures that betrayed their own kind for the sake of control over a powerful temple. The traitors used the trust of the simple townsfolk to infiltrate the temple area, and then used raw force to breech the temple's defenses, murdering the loyal guardians before seizing control of the site. Once in control of the temple, the city's rulers were caught and slain and the attackers seized the reigns of the whole city. Their efforts were for naught; within the year, the city was burned to the ground by an army of the avian peoples.~
@103239 = ~The Doombringers~
@103240 = ~The world was not always as it is now. There was a time before time, when the land was shaped by the will of the creator races. These were not gods, but the power and magic they wielded was greater than anything seen since. For ages they ruled unchallenged, but at the time of the great cooling a new threat emerged. The new races, the lesser beasts that would become you and I, had grown in confidence and power and began asserting themselves on the land.
One of the creator races - their name is now lost to the wastes, and let it never be found or spoken again - turned its awesome power to conquest, and brought forth the great warrior machines. They were fearsome to behold, and there was no doubt to their intent; they were the Doombringers, and they would unleash devastating power upon the world. The young races should have been trampled underfoot, but fate intervened.

The masters of the Doombringers had seen their empire pushed to the edges of the Realms, past the peaks of what would become the Spine of the World. They huddled in the lonely mountains, waiting for their old glory to return. But this race had upset the greater balance with their war machines, taking away the very life force of the earth around them. They did not heed the groaning of the stone until their great halls and vaults fell around them and closed them under the earth.

Entombed, the Creators could not mind their Doombringers, now standing idle before the forces that would destroy them; the lesser races, the earliest of us but not yet us. They were as ants beneath the giants, but they slowly brought them down. It was victory, but it was only the inattention of the masters that allowed it. They would not stay buried. The threat would surely come again and all lived in fear... until the forgetting.

Song and tale have passed the legends of the earliest times, but much has been lost of how we gained our foothold among giants. All we really know is that now we are the masters, the creators of things grand and beautiful, and whatever came before is gone. There are ants beneath our feet that we think nothing of... but it is best to remember that we were once as they, and above us were beings greater than we shall ever be. Let us be mindful, and not look away, lest our own Doombringers fall.~
@103241 = ~The Sword Coast~
@103242 = ~Between Waterdeep and the Spine of the World lies a wedge-shaped piece of land along the coast of the Sea of Swords, roughly seven hundred miles north to south and almost two hundred miles across at its widest. At the western tip of the Spine of the World is Icewind Dale, the northernmost settled land in this part of Faerûn. The Long Road stretching from Waterdeep to Mirabar defines the eastern extent of the Sword Coast North.
The Sword Coast was the first part of the North to be inhabited by civilized people. Most of its area is covered in gently rolling grasslands, and herders and farmers found an easy living here. Sometimes the land touches the Sea of Swords in a pebble beach, but it more often meets the water in a series of sea caves, broken rock spits, and low cliffs marked by pillars of rock severed by the tireless waves. This terrain lends itself to smuggling, but it also forces ships that navigate close to the shore to be small and of shallow draft, and therefore they are vulnerable to the driving onshore storms that often pound the area.

Wooded hills and forbidding mountains bound the region to the east, and beyond this barrier is the expanse of the Dessarin river system.

Along the Sword Coast, the great trade towns of Leilon, Luskan, Neverwinter, Port Llast, and Waterdeep keep the area from descending into chaos. The central portion of the northern Sword Coast is underlain by several cavern systems; the Endless Caverns of the High Forest, the Underground River system of the High Moor (accessed from Dragonspear Castle far to the south), and the caverns under Mount Waterdeep that dwarves expanded into Undermountain.~
@103243 = ~The City of Neverwinter~
@103244 = ~The City of Skilled Hands is a beautiful, relaxed place. It is a walled city of over 20,000, mainly humans and half-elves.
Craftsmen love the beauty of Neverwinter, and constantly try to outdo each other in striving for ever-increasing efficiency and beauty of design.

Many Harpers dwell in Neverwinter, as do a few skilled dwarven craftspeople of note. Many good-aligned spellcasters also make Neverwinter their home, including the Many-Starred Cloak, a band of wizards who support Lord Nasher's rule with their spells and some say hold the real power in the city. The 'Cloak also produces blastglobes for the 400-strong city militia. 

Neverwintans tend to be quiet, mannered, literate, efficient, and hard-working folk. Deadlines and precision are important in all they do. They respect not only the property of others, but also whatever interests another person holds important for personal happiness. "Following one's weird" is a Neverwintan saying for odd or reckless behavior. Everyone native to this city understands the need to do such. 

All in all, Neverwinter is perhaps the most cosmopolitan city in Faerun, escaping Waterdeep's slums and grasping competitiveness, and Silverymoon's harsher climate and heavier need for defense against orcs and other evils. Cities in Amn and Calimshan commonly claim to be more civilized, but merchants who trade there all say that Neverwinter truly is civilized, unlike some showier rivals who, as the sage Mellomir once put it, "have achieved decadence without the need for passing through civilization first."

Neverwinter is divided into several sections, called districts. They are the City Core, the Blacklake, the Docks, the Peninsula, and the Beggar's Nest. The City Core is the focal point of commerce, and houses Castle Never, the seat of government, and the Hall of Justice, a temple of Tyr. The Blacklake district is home to the nobility, while the Beggar's Nest is populated by many of Neverwinter's less wealthy citizens. The Peninsula is constructed around a prison complex, and the Docks district is home to one of the most extensive harbors of the Sword Coast.~
@103245 = ~The Neverwinter Wood~
@103246 = ~This hefty tome attempts a complete history of the Neverwinter Wood, but the crux of what is known is summed up in the following passage:
While many a tale has suggested that there are dark forces that call the wood their home, there is yet no definite answer as to what truly hides within. Many a glade has a guardian force watching over it, but never one so malevolent as is supposedly in residence there. These woods have never been logged by men, for they are feared and shunned by locals, and even orc hordes alter their course around and never through, though usually only after suffering a goodly number of stubborn casualties.~
@103247 = ~The City of Luskan~
@103248 = ~The City of Sails is a dangerous place, a port city filled with pirates and bloodthirsty thugs. It straddles the mouth of the icy river Mirar and stands as the gateway to the mineral wealth of Mirabar.
Luskan is ostensibly ruled by five high captains: Taerl, Baram, Kurth, Suljack, and Rethnor. However, it is suspected that the real power in Luskan is wielded by the Arcane brotherhood from their island tower.

The seafaring merchants of Luskan have always been fierce, proud, and warlike. Over their long history they have feuded with the inland city of Mirabar, the coastal city of Neverwinter, and the island realm of Ruathym. Even today they sponsor pirates who prey on ships and ports up and down the Sword Coast. They also trade with Amn, Calimshan, and many other towns that prefer not to be associated with them, but will meet them on the neutral ground of offshore Mintarn.

The Mirar River divides the city into two major parts. The northern section is a walled enclave, consisting almost entirely of warehouses. The southern half of the city is much older. Outlying walled caravan compounds surround this heavily fortified section of the city.

There are three bridges that connect the two halves of the city. They are the Harbor Cross, Dalath's Span, and the Upstream Span. Five major island crowd the mouth of the Mirar, and the three closest to the south bank are developed. The major areas within Luskan are the Captains' Close, the Harbor District, the Mirabar District, the Reach, and the Spans.~
@103249 = ~The Trade of Blades~
@103250 = ~Penned by Augustavus Cale, founder of the notorious Trade of Blades guild and freehouse, this book appears to be a rather lengthy self-published rant on why the city guards of Neverwinter should not be wasting time trying to moderate the activities of mercenaries. His "argument" appears to be thinly veiled extortion, implying untold mayhem if the needs of these sellswords are not accommodated.
Excerpt:
Much has been made of the threat to our lands and homes posed by men and women of the sword, those that walk the roads with no ties to lord or lady. Many have argued that allowing these creatures to maintain quarters in Neverwinter is to invite trouble. I would say that to turn them away would bring double or triple hardship down upon the surrounding settlements. If you deny the mercenary his living, what recourse will he or she have but to turn to banditry?

Would it not make sense to allow the Trade of Blades to welcome them, thus imparting a sense of kinship with the city? Does it need to be said that having them here for our hire is far better than turning them away and into the arms of our enemies? It is in the best interests of Neverwinter that not only is the mercenary tolerated, but welcomed.~
@103251 = ~The Ghost of Conyberry~
@103252 = ~This haunted grove is the chief landmark in the Conyberry area. The ghost of Neverwinter Wood is actually a banshee, known as Agatha. This name is almost certainly a corruption of the elven surname Auglathla, which means "Winterbreeze" in one of the older elven dialects. She lairs in a grove in Neverwinter Wood, northwest of Conyberry. Her haunt is at the end of a path whose entrance is marked by a strand of birch trees.
At one time Agatha's lair was guarded by a magic mirror spell. This was set up to hide her real location, and give her time to hurl spells at intruders. The heroes Drizzt Do'Urden and Wulfgar son of Beornegar shattered these defenses. The two adventurers then stole her treasure.

The banshee had amassed her treasure hoard by thieving in the night, slaying travelers, and pillaging old tombs and ruins. Since her wealth was stolen, she has taken to looting the Dessarin again, trying to rebuild her riches. She also seeks revenge for the theft, and so considers any adventurers fitting recipients of death.

Agatha's lair has new defenses now. Her spells enable her to charm the people of Conyberry into digging pitfall traps along the path to her lair. These servants have also been seen guarding her haunt. Other than this, Agatha does not bother the folk of Conyberry. Rather, she views them as allies. Agatha often uses her spells to bring them beasts for food in the worst winter weather. She also slaughters orcs and brigands who venture too near to the village. Folk in Conyberry regard Agatha almost affectionately as their guardian and friend. They often talk about her, and speculate on what she's up to.~
@103253 = ~The Dessarin River~
@103254 = ~Long ago, before there were roads anywhere north of Tethyr, the Dessarin was known as the Road to the North. The river reaches up past Waterdeep to the Evermoors, and into the eastern end of the Spine of the World.
When humankind first explored the North, they chose the surprisingly fertile Dessarin delta for their first settlements. To this date, more humans live in the long, broad valley of the Dessarin than in any other part of the Savage Frontier. The farms and ranches of the delta feed the remote mining settlements of the North, and fall prey to the orc hordes that sweep down the Dessarin every decade or so.

This great river carves the rough hills of the central North into a broad, gentle valley. It is the principal route for trade and commerce in the region, linking Waterdeep near its mouth with Yartar and Silverymoon hundreds of miles upstream.

Minstrels sometimes describe the Dessarin as a sword thrusting up into the heart of the North. In fact, the river itself was once known as the Sword. This is important knowledge to those puzzling out Netherese and other ancient writings, trying to locate important sites or priceless treasure.~
@103255 = ~The Rival Orc Tribes & their Great Battles~
@103256 = ~One portal opened by Mulhorand's rebellious wizards led to a world populated by savage orcs. These orcs used the portal to invade Faerûn, overrunning many northern settlements and slaying thousands. The manifestations of the god-kings of both Mulhorand and Unther battled the orcs, and the orcs retaliated by summoning divine avatars of their own deities. During these conflicts, known as the Orcgate Wars, the orc god Gruumsh slew the Mulhorandi sun god Re, the first known deicide in the Realms. Many of the Untheric deities were slain as well. The human deities eventually prevailed and the orcs were slain or driven northward.
The deities Set and Osiris battled to succeed Re, and Set murdered his rival. Horus absorbed the divine power of Re and became Horus-Re, defeated Set, and cast the evil god into the desert. Isis resurrected Osiris. All of the Mulhorandi pantheon but Set united in support of Horus-Re. The two old nations paused to rebuild their power and lick their wounds. During this time the empires of Raumathar and Narfell rose in the battlefield territories to the north. In Unther, their chief god Enlil abdicated in favor of his son Gilgeam and vanished, and Ishtar, the only other surviving Untheric deity, gave the power of her manifestation to Isis and vanished as well. Gilgeam began his 2,000-year decline into despotic tyranny as the ruler of Unther.~
@103257 = ~The Ruins of Illusk~
@103258 = ~The remnants of the ancient city of Illusk stand on the southern shore of the Mirar, in the lee of Closeguard Island. All that remains of this once-proud city are a few shattered towers and toppled statues choked with creepers and thick brush. These ruins are bounded to the north by Luskan's busy market and to the south by the city's noisy slums, and bisected by the Darkwalk, the street that leads to the Dark Arch. The Darkwalk is named for the haunted reputation that clings to the ruins of Illusk.
Fear of the magical traps and guardian monsters, as well as the sleepless undead, has kept most of the tombs and treasure undisturbed. Still, a few enterprising rogues have escaped the ruins with spellbooks, scrolls, magic armor, and rich caches of gems and coins. The dead far outnumber these lucky few though, and Luskanites have a saying: "Only the most desperate try to rob the dead of Illusk." 

Luskanites rarely brave the overgrown northern ruins, even in the full light of day. There are persistent rumors of slave traders kidnapping folk and taking them below (a fate often threatened for unruly children by Luskanite mothers). No known maps of the underground chambers and passages exist, and no Luskanite will admit to knowing their ways.~

@103260 = ~The Sword Coast North is home to some of the most noteworthy personalities of the Realms. Many won their fame with deeds of great honor, but others are known for the depths of their depravity and wickedness.
The officers of Neverwinter fall into the first camp. Lord Nasher Alagondar, Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, Watchknight Desther Indelayne, and Abbot Fenthick Moss are celebrated for their kindness and wisdom, and each of these heroes has taken the safety of Neverwinter as his or her sacred duty

On the more sinister side, the five High Captains of Luskan are some of the most cruel and ruthless warriors in the region. High Captains Taerl, Baram, Kurth, Suljack, and Rethnor are each vicious combatants, and together they enforce their will with merciless efficiency. 

The most powerful and feared spellcasters on the Sword Coast are members of the Arcane Brotherhood of Luskan. Among their number are Jaluth Alaerth, Ornar of the Claw, and Deltagar Zelhund. Little is known of the Brotherhood's actual role in governing Luskan and the surrounding areas, and the members themselves are loath to discuss their activities.

The untamed lands outside the cities hold countless other instances of fame and infamy alike. King Obould Many-Arrows, for instance, reigns over his orc tribes with an iron fist while such well-known rakes and ne'er-do-wells as Elaith 'The Serpent' Craulnober move constantly from hamlet to hamlet to avoid detection.~
@103261 = ~Helm's Hold~
@103262 = ~Less than a day's travel southeast of Neverwinter is Helm's Hold, a fortified monastery dedicated to the God of Guardians. It was founded around the middle 1340s DR (Dale Reckoning) by Dumal Erard, a retired member of the Company of Crazed Venturers of Waterdeep. It has grown to a watchful community of over 700 faithful. The people here grow their own crops, herd their own cattle, dig deep wells for their own water, and patrol the area with vigilance. They will give shelter to any travelers beset or weakened by brigands or monsters.~
@103263 = ~Luskan's Arcane Brotherhood~
@103264 = ~The dangers of Illusk pale in comparison to the Host Tower of the Arcane - the home of the Arcane Brotherhood. This magically created stone structure is built to resemble a giant tree or an open human hand. It rises into a central spire surrounded by four spires at the points of the compass. All are of equal height, and each bristles with many lesser spires, balconies, and branching turrets.
The Arcane Brotherhood is a mercantile company and spellcaster's guild. It maintains several safe houses in Luskan and in other cities of the North, and at least one fortress somewhere in the mountains north and east of Luskan. The Host Tower, however, is the seat of its strength.

Hard information on the upper echelons of the Arcane Brotherhood is very difficult to come by. It is clear, though, that some of the senior wizards have recently been destroyed or trapped in forms from which they can't escape, communicate, or work magic. Some have been moved behind the scenes, and some have left the Brotherhood to pursue their own aims - lichdom, mastery in other lands or planes of existence, and so on. Even still, it should be noted that current activities of the Zhentarim, the Cult of the Dragon, and the Red Wizards of Thay reveal that they haven't managed to place agents or even spies in any positions of importance within the Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood has been known to change with menacing rapidity, as its internal feuds tend to be deadly. Travelers are advised to avoid even coming to the attention of this evil, manipulative group.~
@103265 = ~Uthgardt Barbarians~
@103266 = ~The Uthgardt are a race of black-haired and blue-eyed humans who are descendants of the Northmen, Netherese, and a few savage tribes. 
The Uthgardt are presently divided into scattered tribes, each named after the beast totems which Uthgar conquered - Black Lion, Thunderbeast, Red Tiger, Blue Bear, Great Worm, Sky Pony, Tree Ghost, Black Raven, Griffon, and Gray Wolf. Although civilization has come north in waves throughout history, much of Uthgardt land is wild and untamed. Their lands extend north into the mountains of the Spine of the World, south to Stone Bridge, east to Cold Wood, and west to Neverwinter Wood.

Although some tribes have embraced agriculture and fixed habitations, the Uthgardt have few stable villages. Most tribes wander the wilderness in small clans or family groups and live within a few weeks' travel of their ancestor's mounds. Tradition is the centerpiece of Uthgardt life, and this blind devotion to their heritage keeps them savage and primitive. Strength is everything to the Uthgardt, and civilization is a weakness that cannot be tolerated. Among the Uthgardt, men are warriors and hunters - women tend to gathering and family needs. They have no written language and no art beyond geometric carvings and clothing decoration. Their religion and philosophy focus on war, plunder, and survival. Their superstitious nature extends to a deep distrust of magic - particularly arcane magic.

The Uthgardt have little to do with city folk, other than as prey, though some tribes have made "civilized" alliances. Both lone travelers and large caravans are considered ripe fruit for plunder. Though they attack civilized folk and frequently fight amongst themselves, they're quick to unite - even with non-Uthgardt - against their ancestral enemy: the orcs.~
@103267 = ~The Origin of Magic~
@103268 = ~Long ago, magic was more raw and potent than it is today. The great civilizations of the creator races were based on endless experimentation with these energies, and during their long rules they created many new forms of life.
The cruel and decadent creator races chose to release their monstrous mistakes rather than destroy them. Most died in the jungles, yet many lived and - as thought awakened in them - they hid from their creators. When the end came at last, it was they - not the old races - who seized control of Faerûn. 

And so it was that the first of the elves, the dragons, the goblin races, and an endless list of creatures of a new age took possession of their heritage. Their creators - the ancestors of the lizardfolk, bullywugs, and aarakocra - declined into savage barbarism, never to rise again.

Sages speculate about the "overnight" destruction of the creator races. There are wildly diverging theories, but all agree that a rapid climate change occurred, creating a world unsuitable to them. Many believe the change resulted from a cataclysm the races unleashed upon themselves. Proponents of this theory point to the Star Mounts in the High Forest, whose origins are most likely magical and otherworldly. The elves believe that around this time the greater and lesser powers manifested themselves, aiding the new races and confounding the survivors of the creator races. There was civilization in the North during this time period, yet little more than tantalizingly vague myths survive.~
@103269 = ~Return of the Beast~
@103270 = ~At first glance, this ragged tome appears to detail the ancient history of the Sword Coast. Closer inspection reveals the words "Return of the Beast" scrawled across the original title in an almost childlike hand. Whole sections of the book are crossed out and replaced by an indecipherable code, and weird sketches fill the margins. At one point the unnamed second author breaks into near-coherence, though the entry is obscured by some sort of fluid or slime:
"... a slow change. After ages of waiting the BEAST that ruled the land returns to take back their world [from the] upstarts. The BEAST will make slaves of the five crowns, and put whole races to the lash: the elves, the dwarves, and the kingdoms of men will all fall as one..."~
@103271 = ~Wind by the Fireside~
@103272 = ~"Wind by the Fireside" is a poem that has changed much over the ages - that much is clear to those who have studied it - but it is not known how much it has been altered, or why the alterations have taken place. Many scholars assume that these changes are representative of the natural evolution of language, as well as modern innovations of style. Little is known about the actual history of the poem, though some believe it to have some bearing upon the creator races of Faerûn. Others have speculated that it may have been written as an ode by a follower of some ancient religion. The popular version sung in Neverwinter is noted as the following, though other regions have variations in theme.
So as you shiver in the cold and the dark,
Look into the fire and see in its spark - 
My eye
Watching over you.

As you walk in the wind's whistling claws.
Listen past the howling of the wolf's jaws.
My song
Comes to you.

And when you're lost in trackless snow,
Look up high where the eagles go.
My star
Shines for you.

In deep, dark mine or on crumbling peak,
Hear the words of love I speak.
My thoughts
Are with you.

You are not forsaken
You are not forgotten.
The North cannot swallow you.
The snows cannot bury you.
I will come for you.
Faerûn will grow warmer,
And the gods will smile
But oh, my love, guard yourself well - 
All this may not happen for a long, long while.~
@103273 = ~Religions of the Sword Coast~
@103274 = ~The deities of Faerûn take an active interest in their world, channeling power through their clerics and other worshipers and sometimes intervening directly in the affairs of mortals. At the same time, they have their own plots, conflicts, intrigues, and alliances with other deities, powerful mortals, and outsiders such as elemental lords and demons. In their pettiness the deities of the Realms appear almost mortal, and some were once mortals who won the divine spark through great heroism.
Worship is the lifeblood of the gods, and a deity can actually die if his believers lose faith. To keep their worship strong, the gods work through their clerics to recruit new worshipers and keep the flames of faith alive. In return, their clerics are rewarded with spells and other manifestations of the divine will.

Many of the deities of Faerûn are specific to a certain race, such as Corellon Larethian (elves) and Moradin (dwarves) or a profession, such as Cyric (thieves) and Mystra (spellcasters). Others hold sway over aspects of nature, such as Umberlee (storms). Some deities are more central to certain locations, such as Helm's Hold, though it is fairly common to see more than one deity honored in larger towns, such as Neverwinter's devotion to Tyr and Helm, or Luskan's worship of Auril, Umberlee, and Tempus.~
@103275 = ~The Northern Four Adventuring Troupe~
@103276 = ~The Northern Four is the name of a band of adventurers that have each gone on to become key citizens of the Sword Coast. Led by Nasher Alagondar, who became Lord of Neverwinter, the group also consisted of Dumal Erard, who went on to found and watch over Helm's Hold, Ophala Cheldarstorn, matron of the Moonstone Mask who was thought to be an important figure among the mages of the Many-Starred Cloak, and Kurth, who has become a High Captain of Luskan.
The band adventured together successfully for many years, and spawned many tales in their adventures around the region. One popular tale depicts the successful rescue of the Black Raven Tribe from a foul white dragon. As a symbol of gratitude from the tribe, Nasher was gifted with the noted Neverwintan Morregence as a "debt-child."

The success of the troupe eventually came to an end with a leadership struggle between Nasher and Kurth. Ophala was torn between her love for Kurth and her loyalty to Nasher, but after Kurth left, Ophala settled in Neverwinter, unwilling to compromise her hatred for Luskan and its Arcane Brotherhood; many assume that she still bears resentment against Nasher for the way things turned out. Regardless, Nasher and Erard have remained close, and Ophala still serves her Lord loyally. The same cannot be said of Kurth, who has joined forces with an army that would love nothing more than to see Neverwinter destroyed.~
@103277 = ~Port Llast~
@103278 = ~This village of 700 is found on the High Road between Luskan and Neverwinter, and sides with the latter in the feud between the two cities. Fifty men-at-arms from the City of Skilled Hands, bolstered by 30 of the Lords' Alliance troops, aid the local militia in guarding the town from brigand raids and the harassment of Luskan. The Lords' Alliance troops are mainly from Elturel and Baldur's Gate, so that a Luskan attack would risk war with two economically powerful cities.
Port Llast is a city of skilled stonecutters and has a fine harbor. The stonecutters work at quarries on the coastal headlands just south of the village. Other than harborage and stonecutting, there is little else to recommend it to the traveler today, for it is a tense, suspicious place, always expecting treachery or attack from Luskan. Today Port Llast is ruled by the soldier Kendrack, who recently replaced Haeromos Dothwintyl as First Captain. Haeromos was killed during the battle to protect Port Llast from a Sahuagin invasion. 

In the distant past, when Luskan was held by orcs and duergar, Port Llast was a thriving city. It was the last port in human hands as one sailed north (hence the name). In those days, it was home to 14,000 miners and explorers eager to find gold, gems, and all the rest of the fabled mineral wealth of the North. The city was eventually smashed by orc raids, and the shattered remnants of the old walls still ring it, though much stone has been used to repair local homes or has been taken away and sold. Port Llast's outer reaches are overgrown by scrub forest or are used as gardens or graveyards.~
@103279 = ~Uthgar's Legacy~
@103280 = ~Uthgar is the legendary founder and namesake of the Uthgardt barbarians of the Savage Frontier. Some of their legends claim that he is the son of Beorunna, and others that he is descended from Tempus. All the legends agree that Uthgar was a proud, strong warrior who lived three times a normal human life. He ascended to watch over the Uthgardt for all eternity after taking fatal wounds in a one-on-one battle with a frost giant named Gurt. Uthgar mastered all the primeval beast spirits in individual combat, passing down the divine gifts he gained from that mastery to his people, the Uthgardt, at his death. The Uthgardt tribes all follow a beast totem, representing one of the beasts that Uthgar bested.
Historical evidence suggests that Uthgar was probably a Ruathym Northman named Uther Gardolfsson. Uther led a long raiding career - including looting fabled Illuskan - before founding his barbarian dynasty. No one denies that Uthgar or Uther did indeed ascend to divinity on his deathbed, sponsored by the god of war, who admired his fighting spirit.~
@103281 = ~The Imps' Prison~
@103282 = ~Popular legends tell of sylvan creatures luring men within trees, where exists entire kingdoms, known as the faerie realms. A less-popular legend tells of a similarly mischievous group of imps.
According to the tale, these imps lure people into their realms by taunting them with something that they may desire, such as wealth or pleasure. Once the person follows, entranced by the whisperings of the imps, he finds himself within a twisted abyss, bereft of hope or the possibility of escape.~
@103283 = ~The Time of Troubles~
@103284 = ~When Ao cast out the gods from heaven, their avatars walked the earth, interacted with mortals (some more ruthlessly than others), and scrambled to find a way to return to their homes. Known as the Time of Troubles, the Godswar, or the Avatar Crisis, this period in the history of Faerûn is the most chaotic in recent memory.
Sudden mortality wreaked havoc on the deities. Mystra was destroyed and her essence merged with the land, causing magic to function erratically and creating many areas of wild and dead magic. Gond the Wonderbringer fell to earth as a gnome on the shores of Lantan. Grateful for the sanctuary offered by the city, he taught its citizens the secrets of smoke-powder. Tymora appeared at her temple in Arabel and it is thought that her presence there spared the city from destruction. Ibrandul, god of caverns, was slain by Shar and his portfolio stolen. 

Helm retained his divine power and was commanded by Ao to guard the path back to the outer planes. Due to his success in this endeavor, blame for much of the Godswar's destruction is laid at his feet. Malar battled Nobanion and was hunted by Gwaeron Windstrom. Shaundakul battled and destroyed the avatar of a minor orc deity. Sharess took the form of the favorite concubine of the pasha of Calimport and was liberated from the growing influence of Shar by Sune. The Red Knight appeared in Tethyr, helping that nation defeat monsters raiding from the Wealdath. 

Hoar slew Ramman, Untheric god of war, but lost his foe's portfolio to Anhur. Clangeddin Silverbeard battled Labelas Enoreth over a misunderstanding. Waukeen vanished and custody of her portfolio was claimed by her ally Lliira. The avatar of the godling Iyachtu Xvim, half-demon offspring of Bane, was imprisoned under Zhentil Keep. Gilgeam, the god-king of Unther, was slain by his rival Tiamat, ending his two-millennia rule of that nation.

Bhaal, the god of murder, was greatly weakened at the time of the Godswar and existed only as a murderous force that could possess living beings. When Bane challenged Torm, the Black Lord slew all of the assassins in Faerûn and absorbed their essence, further weakening Bhaal. 

Forging an alliance with Myrkul, Bhaal kidnapped the mortal Midnight and discovered one of the tablets of fate. But at the Boaraskyr Bridge Bhaal was killed by the mortal Cyric with the sword Godsbane (the avatar of Mask). Cyric absorbed some of Bhaal's power, while the rest went into the Winding Water, poisoning it.

Leira, goddess of deception and illusions, was slain by Cyric with Godsbane and her portfolio absorbed by him. Cyric later broke Godsbane, greatly weakening Mask.

Bane was destroyed by Torm during a battle in Tantras, and his portfolio was given to Cyric by Ao. Torm himself was destroyed in the conflict with Bane, but because at the time his realm was actually Toril and because he died in service to his ethos (obedience and duty), lord Ao restored him to life and reinstated him as a deity.

Myrkul's avatar battled Midnight, and she destroyed him. Midnight became the new incarnation of Mystra, absorbing the essence of the previous goddess from the land. Cyric became the new god of strife, tyranny, murder, and death, holding the portfolios of the slain Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul (years later he lost the portfolio of death to the mortal Kelemvor when he was temporarily driven mad by an artifact he created).

The close of the Avatar Crisis brought a change to the way deities relate to their followers. By Ao's decree, a deity's power is related to the number and fervor of his worshippers, and so deities could no longer afford to ignore their faithful. While the Godswar reshaped the land and altered the Faerûnian pantheon dramatically, the accountability of divinity is the most powerful legacy of the Time of Troubles.~
@103285 = ~The Nether Scrolls~
@103286 = ~Long ago, an unknown adventurer discovered a set of magic writings that held vast secrets of magic. These writings came to be called the Nether Scrolls. Taken together, they granted insight into the mysteries of spellcasting, the creation of magic items and constructs, the relations and structure of the planes, and even the making of artifacts. Although all of the Nether Scrolls were lost or stolen over the following 2,000 years, by then the information they contained had changed Netherese society forever.
The lords of Netheril developed forms of magic never before seen in the world. The mythallar was a invention by the Netherese wizard Ioulaum that gave power to nearby items, negating the need for expenditure of a spellcaster's energy to create magic items. The mythallar also allowed the creation of flying cities, formed by slicing off and inverting the top of a mountain. Netheril's people took to the skies in these flying enclaves of magic, safe from human barbarians and hordes of evil humanoids. Every citizen wielded minor magic, and the Netherese traded with nearby elven and dwarven nations, expanding the reach of their empire greatly.~
@103287 = ~The War of Light and Darkness~
@103288 = ~Lord Ao created the universe that now holds the world of Toril. After this creation, there was a period of timeless nothingness, a misty realm of shadows that existed before light and darkness were separated. Eventually this shadowy essence coalesced to form twin beautiful goddesses, polar opposites of each other, one dark and one light. The twin goddesses created the bodies of the heavens, creating Chauntea, the embodiment of the world Toril. Toril was lit by the cool radiance of the goddess Selune, and darkened by the welcoming embrace of the goddess Shar, but no heat yet existed in this place.
Chauntea begged for warmth that she might nurture life and living creatures upon her form, and this caused the twin goddesses to become divided in intent. The two fought, and from their divine conflict the deities of war, disease, murder, death, and others were created.

Selûne reached beyond the universe to a plane of fire, using pure flame to ignite one of the heavenly bodies so that Chauntea would be warmed. Shar became enraged and began to snuff out all light and warmth in the universe. Desperate and greatly weakened, Selûne tore the divine essence of magic from her body and hurled it at her sister, tearing through Shar's form and pulling with it like energy from the dark twin. This energy formed Mystryl, the goddess of magic. Composed of light and dark magic but favoring her first mother, Mystryl balanced the battle enough to establish an uneasy truce between the two sisters.

Shar, who remained powerful, nursed a bitter loneliness in the darkness and plotted her revenge. Selûne waxed and waned with the light, but drew strength from her allied daughters and sons, and even interloper deities from other planes. Their battle continues to this day.~
@103289 = ~Waterdeep~
@103290 = ~Waterdeep, often called the City of Splendors, lies on the southwestern edge of the North. It boasts a population of almost a million and a half, though the actual number varies seasonally. In times of busy trade, the city hosts five times this number. Almost every surface-dwelling race has representatives here, and many have taken up permanent residence. The halfling population grows annually, promising to become the largest nonhuman race in residence. To match the racial variety, most religions have shrines or temples.
Waterdeep was first used as a trading site more than two millennia ago. As recently as one thousand years ago, permanent farms had sprung up in the area. The first mention of a Waterdeep (not as a city, but as a collection of warlords) occurred just 400 years ago.

The city was truly established as a going concern by 1032 DR, the year Ahghairon became the first Lord of Waterdeep, and the date from which Northreckoning is counted. The city grew spectacularly, such that by 1248 DR both the City of the Dead and the guilds had been developed. The guildmasters seized control soon afterwards, ushering in a period of unrest and bitter conflict known as the Guildwars. These wars ended only when the two surviving guildmasters brought in their own period of misrule. Not until 1273 DR was the present system of government instituted, with the establishment of the Magisters and the secret Lords of Waterdeep firmly reestablished in power.

Since that time, the city has continued to grow and prosper. Members of every race come from all over the Realms to earn hard coin in the City of Splendors. Over the years these successful merchants have set up guilds and become nobility themselves. The secretive Lords of Waterdeep police the city with a light hand, exercising polite authority by means of the city guard, city watch, and over 20 black-robed magistrates. As a result, Waterdeep has grown tolerant of different races, religions, and lifestyles. This in turn has encouraged commerce, and Waterdeep today is a huge, eclectic city, one of the most vibrant and prosperous in the whole of Faerûn.~
@103291 = ~The Adventures of Grin, Richard, and Wu-Wei~
@103292 = ~Circumstance; she is a goddess in her own right for all she casts upon us. Witness the trials of our three heroes, and know of what I speak. Have knowledge first of young Wu-Wei, sheltered monk of the elven race. Thrown to the winds that he might find a path, instead he found a briar, but with good friends to share the pricking of his fortune.
Joined with him were Grin and Richard, young and true, and in that order. They came with dreams and hopes for fortune; their homes long lost behind them, their bridges burning literal. In time they would address what cast them out, but food and aching feet would first need their attention.

Wayward went they all, breaking trail where dungeons hide. Tales had told of treasure here and treasure there, and they forgot that tales tell tales most of all. Lost they got, and plenty of it.

Then one morn they cracked the dawn, and adventure didn't hide. They needed no scouting skill, no premonition; it landed in their lap, or rather, their camp. A tower, stretching high above as though yawing with them as they woke, somehow seeming just as surprised that its doorstep was there, as they were to be on it.

It was most peculiar, and a cheer went up, for that was what they wanted! Of course it wasn't right; it was adventure, and adventure, most of all, takes you where you shouldn't be. Up they clambered clamoring, sure of what must be done. They would search it well from top to tine, ready to let each corner yield its treasure. Wayward buildings scream of wizards and careless alchemy; there had to be something within, some fortune to walk away with.

Walk away, it did. Grin and Wu were first to sprint the stairs, while Richard lagged behind. The air was wrong for headlong joy, and the walls were unwisely damp, and he thought to himself that something just wasn't right with this instant tower. The topmost rooms would reveal why, ceding no treasure, no gems, and no captured maidens. Instead, there was a mouth, and not just any mouth, but the very worst kind of mouth, it being one that they were already in. Understanding dripped down their spines. The tower was not a tower; what it was, was hungry. Mimic. A bloody great mimic.

Our heroes lived, of course, for I would not wish to profit in their story had they met a tragic end. Although, truth be told, if they had skin on their teeth before their escape, they have surely lost it now, but gained a bit of trepidation and wisdom in its place. Remember well what has been told, and learn from their misfortune. Look for something long enough and you will find it; look for something without understanding, and it will find you.~
@103293 = ~The Rise & Fall of Netheril~
@103294 = ~To the east, on the sandy shores of the calm and shining Narrow Sea, human fishing villages grew into small towns and then joined together as the nation of Netheril. Sages believe the fishing towns were unified by a powerful human wizard who had discovered a book of great magic power that had survived from the Days of Thunder - a book that legend calls the Nether Scrolls. Under this nameless wizard and those who followed, Netheril rose in power and glory, becoming both the first human land in the North and the most powerful. Some say this discovery marked the birth of human wizardry, since before this time mankind had only shamans and witch doctors. For over 3,000 years Netheril dominated the North, but even its legendary wizards were unable to stop their final doom.
Doom for Netheril came in the form of a desert, devouring the Narrow Sea and spreading to fills its banks with dry dust and blowing sand. Legend states when the great wizards of Netheril realized their land was lost, they abandoned it and their countrymen, fleeing to all corners of the world and taking the secrets of wizardry with them. More likely, this was a slow migration that began 3,000 years ago and reached its conclusion 1,500 years later.

Whatever the truth, wizards no longer dwelled in Netheril. To the north, the once-majestic dwarven stronghold of Delzoun fell upon hard days. Then the orcs struck. Orcs have always been foes in the North, surging out of their holes every few tens of generations when their normal haunts can no longer support their burgeoning numbers. This time they charged out of their caverns in the Spine of the World, poured out of abandoned mines in the Graypeaks, screamed out of lost dwarfholds in the Ice Mountains, raged forth from crypt complexes in the Nether Mountains, and stormed upward from the bowels of the High Moon Mountains. Never before or since has then been such an outpouring of orcs.

Delzoun crumbled before this onslaught and was driven in on itself. Netheril, without its wizards, was wiped from the face of history. The Eaerlann elves alone withstood the onslaught, and with the aid of treants of Turlang and other unnamed allies, were able to stave off the final days of their land for yet a few centuries more.

In the east, Eaerlann built the fortress of Ascalhorn and turned it over to refugees from Netheril as Netherese followers built the town of Karse in the High Forest. The fleeing Netherese founded Llorkh and Loudwater. Others wandered the mountains, hills, and moors north and west of the High Forest, becoming ancestors of the Uthgardt and founders of Silverymoon, Everlund, and Sundabar.~
@103295 = ~The Leadership of Neverwinter~
@103296 = ~The city of Neverwinter was originally founded by Lord Halueth Never. This great lord was laid to rest - so local tavern tales swear - on a huge slab of stone encircled by a ring of naked swords laid with their points radiating outward. These magic blades animate to attack all intruders if the precise instructions graven in cryptic verses on the flagstones are not followed.
Today Neverwinter is ruled by Lord Nasher Alagondar, an amiable and balding warrior who keeps his city firmly in the Lords' Alliance. Lord Nasher has laid many intrigues and magical preparations against attacks from Neverwinter's warlike rival town, Luskan. Nasher doesn't allow maps of the city to be made. This is to keep the spies of Luskan busy and add a minor measure of difficulty to any Luskanite invasion plans. 

The royal badge of the city is a white swirl - a sideways "M," with points to the right. It connects three white snowflakes; each flake is different, but all are encircled by silver and blue halos.

Lord Nasher is always accompanied by his bodyguard, the Neverwinter Nine. These warriors are entrusted with the many magic items Nasher accumulated over a very successful decade of adventuring.~

Yet if the reagent of death, in this case the Skeleton Knuckle, is gripped within the strength of the Quartz Crystal and then the spell Mage Armor is cast, the tendrils of death are redirected.

@103303 = ~Explorer's Journal~
@103304 = ~Though this book has been severely damaged by exposure to the elements, large parts of it are surprisingly legible.
Included in its pages are translations of the runic language used by the ancient Netherese.

The remainder seems to be the personal journal of an unnamed explorer who had come to this region determined to find an ancient Netherese temple which he referred to as 'the Ruin of Gur-Atol'.

The last page is of particular interest and reads:

"I've decided to camp in the forest, tonight. Whatever has happened in Charwood, it's something I certainly don't want to get involved in. The villagers there are frightening and will be no help in my search for the temple. It's best I just avoid them entirely.

"Resting in the forest will not be much better, however. To think I scoffed at the tales I was told of it being haunted. It is so eerily silent... yet I will not be deterred. The secret portal that leads into the Ruins of Gur-Atol must be in this area... and I WILL find it. If I am right, the treasure that will still be there will make all these long months worthwhile."~
@103305 = ~Imaskarran Tome of Death~
@103306 = ~This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to 'Death'. Among its more interesting passages is the following:
"The Ettercap Silk Gland is a substance known to augment and accentuate the capabilities of other reagents, and is therefore quite popular amongst the scholars of wizardry. The Skeleton Knuckle is a popular reagent to combine with the gland because the solidifying of the boundaries between life and death causes brief flickers in existence, allowing the wielder to temporarily become invisible. However, when further empowered with the spell Improved Invisibility, the end result is much more stable, and allows for the wielder to maintain more control over the boundaries of magic, life and death."~
@103307 = ~Imaskarran Tome of Fire~
@103308 = ~This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to 'Fire'. Among its more interesting passages is the following:
"The Fire Beetle Belly is an amazing organ that manages to retain its full heat, even after the beetle's death. When combined with the resilience of the Quartz Crystal, and then empowered with the spell Fireball, the end result is a device that can emit bursts of fire at will. The creation of most fire-based wands is based on this simple formula."~
@103309 = ~Imaskarran Tome of Resonance~
@103310 = ~This heavy and tattered tome is labeled with a large and ancient rune that translates simply to 'Resonance'. Among its more interesting passages is the following:
"The Ettercap Silk Gland is a substance known to augment and accentuate the capabilities of other reagents, and is therefore quite popular amongst the scholars of wizardry. When combined with a Fen Berry and the spell Lightning Bolt, a magical mass is created that shimmers and glows while maintaining the electric charge of the spell. Those who have experimented with this mass find that the creation shows a resistance to many magical effects. It can only be guessed that the nature-bound regenerative focus of the Fen Berry discharges Faerun's often-magical effects, while the Silk maintains the power of the Lightning Bolt."~
@103311 = ~Dread Queen Morag~
@103312 = ~The letters in this book swim before your eyes, finally shaping themselves into text that you can understand. It tells the history of a Queen named Morag. While the book is lengthy, one passage of interest tells of Morag's ascension to the throne. 
"At the dawning of her first red moon, Morag, the future queen, began her slow and bloody climb toward the seat of power, her sen-mother's throne. Her ascension to the heights of the Dragon Throne was as that of a slow poison: deadly, inevitable, and filled with fatal pleasures.
 
"Morag's yolk-sister, Sedat, was the first victim of the rising queen's awesome cunning. On the day before her ring-stone ceremony, Sedat entered her hibernation chambers to meditate. Out of the fire's glowing embers crawled a venomous Zelfit. When the priestess arrived to escort Sedat to the ceremonial chambers the next morning, she found the limp, dead husk of the favored child.

"So it was that Morag, our blessed Dreadqueen, made the first move in her Game of Maids. Many moons later it would lead to the Siege of Tykalat, where she would take the head of her sen-mother and display it in glorious triumph to her adoring throng. Thus began the rule of our all-magnificent Queen Morag."~
@103313 = ~Initiate's Primer~
@103314 = ~The letters swim before your eyes, shaping themselves into text that you can understand. This book seems to be a basic guide for priestly initiates who took care of the ancient tomb in which it was found. One passage catches your eye...
"In the early years of the reign of the Thunder Queen, Lagosra, a call went out for the greatest architects and builders of the age. Kerik, hatched of Menron, came to the king and agreed to build a tomb that would house the rulers of our people for all time.

"Kerik took ten years to complete the project, but when it was finished the citizens of the kingdom gaped in amazement at the wonder that had been wrought. Lagosra was pleased and bestowed upon Kerik the honor of being first sacrifice at the tomb's blessing."~
@103317 = ~Halueth Dig Logbook~
@103318 = ~NP: This book tells about the first search for the tomb of Halwet Nevers. She's not finished. Apparently, the author died of pestilence before he had time to finish it, but here are the coordinates of three possible burial sites, in addition to the one in the peninsula area. Beggar's Nest: Great Cemetery Waterfront: aqueducts in the northwestern quarter Blackzero: southwestern quarter Location descriptions are inaccurate, but the book mentions that each tomb is most likely sealed by magic. A certain riddle is the 'key' to every door. The solution to the door to the tomb on the Peninsula is 'Emerald.' The answer was found when an emerald was placed next to the door in a container. It should be noted that this action destroyed the stone, which made this discovery quite expensive.~ /*This book details the initial search for the tomb of Halueth Never. It is unfinished, the writer obviously falling to the plague before he could include many details, but it does point to the possible locations for three tombs in addition to the one in the Peninsula District.
Beggar's Nest: Great Graveyard
Docks District: Northwestern quarter aqueducts
Blacklake District: Southwestern quarter

The directions are vague, but the book does mention that each tomb is likely sealed with a magically protected door. A riddle of some sort is the "key" to each. The solution to the Peninsula tomb door was "Emerald," which was answered by actually placing an emerald in the container immediately next to the door. It is worth noting that this action seemed to destroy the item, making it an expensive discovery.

Text of the "Emerald riddle" on the Peninsula tomb:
Diamond of the forest, if the seasons never changed.*/
@103319 = ~Lady Tanglebrook's Journal~
@103320 = ~...Everyone, everyone is dead. All I have left is my cousin Alaefin, the Head Gaoler. He has been so good to me in the past, even building a tunnel between his office and the estate so I could visit him without running the risk of actually walking the dangerous peninsula streets. How fortuitous that these same tunnels now protect me from exposure to the plague. I am going to meet with him later today, for I know a good game of chess shall cheer me up from this spiteful malaise into which I have fallen.
Hmm -- that was odd. I thought I heard something crashing around downstairs but when I went down there, there was nothing. Must have been the rats! Oh, how I hate living alone. I shall visit my cousin at once!~
@103321 = ~Journal of Meldanen~
@103322 = ~This book is full of tightly-scripted dates and notes, a journal kept by the wizard Meldanen. Most entries are short and to the point, regarding his various magical experiments and some of the creatures he has paid to have smuggled into the city for his examination.
Most recently, however, his entries become much more interesting:

Excerpt:
The gods have smiled on my destiny. I had heard a little about the creatures being brought to the city from Waterdeep, but thought little of my chances of even laying eyes upon them. Lo and behold, however, I discovered a dryad from that very shipment wandering the streets of the district, lost and frightened after the battle in the Academy. It was glad enough to accompany me and I have caged it for the moment until I decide what to do with it.

Excerpt (the following day):
I have decided to experiment upon this dryad and find a cure for this plague on my own. Think of all the gold the panicked nobles of this city would offer for a cure! It is too bad that the dryad must be sacrificed, however... she is comely, if inhuman.

Excerpt (Several Days Later):
I cannot get the dryad out of my mind. Thoughts of her are with me always. Today I attempted to draw blood from her to fuel my experiment and found I could not hurt her even that much. Has she enchanted me? Or am I simply lonely for such beauty? I cannot think clearly. Still she recoils from my touch... I must win her love, I must! I will not release her from the cage until she feels as I do!~
@103323 = ~NP: True Strike Volume~ /*The Nightthief's Claw*/
@103324 = ~NP: Secret symbols are printed on the cover of this book, there is no doubt that it has magical properties of one kind or another. Until you try to read or identify it, its exact origin will remain a mystery to you.~ /*This bracelet appears to have no magical properties, though its simple yet elegant design should bring a fair price at market.*/
@103325 = ~NP: Tome of Precise Strike Reading this tome permanently gains a +1 bonus to THAC0. STATS: Permanent +1 bonus to THAC0. The volume disappears after being read.~ /*It's one thing to say the law is always right, but there are exceptions to every rule.*/
@103326 = ~Black Grimoire~
@103327 = ~This aged text feels cold to the touch, and your fingers are numb after handling it. Within its tainted pages are revealed the methods by which a person can summon forth the most heinous of creatures. Interestingly, there are also instructions on how to banish evil once summoned, should it prove too troublesome for the caster to deal with. This book would have to be used in very controlled circumstances, lest it have no effect, or worse, an uncontrolled one. Merely having it in one's possession will allow the use of a properly prepared altar.~
@103328 = ~Small Diary~
@103329 = ~The book is a small journal of sorts that does not appear to have been in use for long. The entries appear to have been made by Lady Aribeth. Of particular note is the last:
"Maugrim has assigned me quarters with the other ambassadors, though I don't know for how long. He tells me only that he serves a greater power, and hints that I will come to revere this being far more than I ever did Tyr.

"I do not know if that is true. I am not sure of anything anymore except that I have Fallen. Fallen out of love with my lord, my people and my God. I am alone in a world where there is no justice and no hope and I cannot... I cannot get these thoughts out of my mind.

"They burn my every waking moment and whisper to me in my dreams. I shall go mad, I think, if I am not mad already. To do the wrong thing seems far better, however, than to do nothing at all. I am on this path now, and it goes only forward... perhaps at its end I shall find my own justice and the dreams will stop.

"I can only hope."~
@103330 = ~Blood War Research Journal~
@103331 = ~This thick volume is filled with numerous details on the planar experiments the Arcane Brotherhood has been performing, at the request of Archmage Arklem Greeth.
Most of the entries go into exhaustive detail. It seems the wizards have 'attuned' several portals to the abyssal and hellish planes, attempting to research the eternal Blood War being carried on by the demons and devils.

No conclusion seems to have been drawn, but it is pointed out in several places that one curious property of the portals is that their attunement is easily disrupted by material of the opposing planes. One wizard warns that trying to actually send material from one plane through the wrong portal could be highly destructive.~
@103332 = ~Maugrim's Journal~
@103333 = ~This small book is filled sparsely with notes in Maugrim's now-familiar scrawl. Several entries are of particular interest:
"The tower is ours! That over-ambitious fool, Arklem, trusted me far too much. I would gladly have ended his undead existence had his demon witch not sent him away so quickly. Well, he'll not have use of her advice any longer, I've seen to that."

"Morag is displeased with me, however. So far the wizards I have sent forth from the tower have found only one of the Words of Power. She needs them all! We shall have the one in Neverwinter soon... and once the last three are located, all shall be as Morag wished. I remain confident of success."

"The plague ravages Neverwinter, just as Morag foretold. With each death by Wailing she grows stronger. Already she is able to appear in corporeal form... and with the coming war, she shall become even stronger still!"

"I have received word that the old fool Nasher has been successful in stopping the plague, having acquired some help from adventurers. No matter...the deed is already done. Neverwinter is weakened and what strength it has lost, Morag has gained. Morag says that Nasher's execution of the fool Fenthick will only serve us... soon his greatest champion shall be ours, instead!"

"The High Captains decimate each other daily, just as I suspected. I care not whether any of the fools actually succeed... better is they all die, for none of them will lead the army as I promised them. Morag's nightly visits to Aribeth have had the desired effect: the former paladin has come and lain herself willingly at our feet. She shall lead the great host herself as Morag's champion! The Words will be ours and Morag shall triumph! Glorious shall be the day!"~
@103334 = ~Host Tower Lab Notes~
@103335 = ~This book explains that the focus of a lab found on this level is to summon a powerful weapon. The arcane ritual appears to mention two ingredients to be placed within the Alchemist's Apparatus - a gargoyle's skull and a slaad's tongue.

@103415 = ~This note was found in the eastern passage of Castle Jhareg's main floor. It chastises you in its graceful scrawl:
"To be Judge is to be a ship upon a sea of great Regret. If you shift the ballast of your Compassion wholly to starboard or to port, you will capsize and be Lost beneath the waves. For even Compassion cannot bring the dead to life nor change the horror of the past. Remember this lesson when it comes time to Judge."~
@103416 = ~This note was found in the west passage of Castle Jhareg's main floor. It chastises you in its graceful scrawl:

@103434 = ~This portrait is a rather unremarkable likeness of Sir Reginald Rumbottom III. The only things that stand out about it are the strange markings on the back of the canvas. They are largely illegible, but the name "Ophala Cheldarstorn" does appear to be among them.~

@103436 = ~This urn makes a rather cheap attempt at appearing stately, and may have once held the ashes of a respected but poor merchant or minor noble. More recently it has held delicious-smelling after-dinner mints. It bears a dent that could have come from gripping it at the lip and delivering a swinging blow to the back of someone's skull, likely leaving his or her head in much the same condition as the urn.

But soon it filled with water that became too heavy, and it came crashing down to rejoin with those who came before - an embrace that left it no longer uncertain of its place within the world."~

@103454 = ~Carved upon this bit of kindling wood is the following phrase: "And the fire was angry that it could not overcome the rain above. The air taunted the fire, knowing that fire needed the air to live. Such is the way of those who have come late in life."~

@103462 = ~NP: Once, a man who looked like a real goner came to a famous magician. He ordered him to make a magical amulet that would increase his strength, agility and endurance. The magician agreed to make such an amulet for 3000 gold. But the cunning man did not want to pay such a large amount of money, and when he pried for the amulet, he snatched it from the hands of the magician and ran away. The magician by no means considered himself a fool. While working, he put a curse into the amulet that made its owner an ugly fool. He expected to remove the curse after the gold settled in his pocket, but if it turned out differently, then the curse is still valid.

What it is, however, and why it's being sought is still a mystery that needs solving. Master Drogan believes that a comrade of his, Garrick Halassar, might have the knowledge needed to identify the crystal. The halfling caravan is traveling through the desert and will be making a stop at the same Ao encampment where they dropped off Garrick before... once there, he will have to be found and the crystal hopefully identified.*/

It does not reveal exactly what will be for sale, but it does seem to suggest that anyone interested in surviving the plague should attend.

The seal at the bottom is apparently that of the Bloodsailors, a group of pirates.

@103490 = ~This document seems to be official; the wax stamped with what appears to be the official seal of Lord Nasher and the delicately-written script spelling out a friendly endorsement for one 'Hayden, Lord Freidling'. It appears to prove that Mr. Freidling worked as a coachman in Murann for the entire duration of the previous year... and so couldn't possibly have been present in the city of Calimport for an unmentioned crime.

Excerpt:
When you have pulled what information you can from Vengaul's wench, join us in the Aqueducts. The entrance is in the very northwest of the Docks District, through an old maintenance building.

Entry # 32.
Word came down from Maugrim in the tower in Luskan today. I'm being sent to Neverwinter Wood with some lackeys to attack some spirit creature. The bloody wizard's given me a vial of poison, supposed to be incurable, short of the single-shot antidote he gave me. I'm not sure why he gave me the antidote though. Possibly I could use it for bartering for something, though Talos only knows what we're searching for. Some of his wizards are coming with us. They'd better not get in my way or I'll...

Entry # 34.
... stupid wizards want to kill me. They say it's the only way to enter this other realm. I'll be damned if I let some bony-arsed ...

Entry # 39.
Idiot wizards let it slip that there be three other cult agents in the area. One be holed up in Luskan, (and let me just add that the finest of whorehouses be in that town), the second be exploring some caves to the north of Port Llast, while the other be in Charwood, a place I know precious little about. I'm thinking that when me adventure here be done, there may be a wee bit of gold to be earned with such information.

Entry # 52
... and a damn-fine pickle me be in now. Hork and Tythit both are dead, killed by the Spirit while I poisoned the tree. Then those... wizards took off and left me here to die. I don't know how, but ya can count on Relmar to find his way back home and when I do...

Entry # 57.
What be wrong with this place? Every landmark disappears without a trace. It seems like there be no way out. It makes me want to shout... What the blazes am I rhyming for? I don't know what's happening, but I decided I had better hide the antidote to the poison, before I get jumped by the Spirit. All blasted night the thing wails. Last night I just about got up and took the antidote over to pour on its tree. Can't imagine what I was thinking...

The last entry is almost incomprehensible, as the ability to think or write coherently seems to have been stripped from the dwarf's mind. It does mention something about a pile of rocks to the northwest of the Spirit.~

"As is customary, the elderly were eliminated, the young males crippled and sent to work in the iron mines, and the virile females were returned to the pens for the purposes of breeding."~

@103760 = ~NP: Light wind~ /*Light Flail*/
@103761 = ~NP: At first glance, this club seems ordinary, but upon closer inspection, a well-trained eye reveals rows of individual runes that encircle its hilt. The thief may also note the superior balance of this weapon. The club was enchanted long ago at the behest of the master of the Shadow Thieves Guild for one of his loyal - and wealthy - protégés. Being, on the one hand, a powerful enough weapon, at the same time, it drowns out the sounds around the thief when he sneaks towards the target in order to send it into a deep knockout. The last thing that many opponents feel before losing consciousness is a small puff of air from the club raised above their heads, for which it was quickly dubbed &quot;Light Breeze&quot;. Unfortunately, as is often the case in such cases, the protégé once fell short of the Guild Master's hopes, and on a dark night this weapon led him to his death in his own bed. His wife, who was sleeping next to him, did not hear anything. How far this weapon went before it fell into your hands is a story you don't want to know. STATS: THAC0: +2 bonus Damage: 1D6 +2 Traits: Grants a 10% bonus to Move Silently when equipped Damage Type: Blunt Weight: 3 Haste Factor: 4 Skill Type: Clubs Type: 1-Hand Requires: 5 Strength Not used by: Mage~ /*By Stuufshirt the Scribe
As the title suggests, this rather hefty tome deals with the lives of heroes and villains. It does not condone or condemn, but instead looks at how history defines the roles they played. A leather bookmark identifies the last passage read.

"The ages have long since turned his enemies to dust, but it has done as much to his own people as well. There is no one left to curse or praise his name. What, therefore, is Maegel now? History cannot judge him hero or villain: he is simply dead. He suffers the same as many others; disinterest has allowed the location of his resting-place to fall into obscurity. The family Ortov has no living extensions, and even the long buried Mirialis Clan founded by his siblings has had its major works removed from the libraries of Candlekeep in favor of books more likely to be of interest to anyone."*/
@103762 = ~NP: Guard Alatissa~ /*Bridge Guard*/
@103763 = ~NP: Alatis Harbleton was one of the many halflings who chose a profession that is not customary to mention in pleasant conversation. He had a good career in Luskan, until a series of unpleasant events forced him to consider moving to a new place. Settling in the walls of the capital of Waterdeep, he continued his activities. His desire to go it alone in earning dishonest money infuriated local guilds such as the infamous Night Masks, so he had to enlist a wizard to enchant his hood to protect himself from frequent attempts on his life. Arrogant and confident in his invulnerability, he nevertheless got caught in a daring robbery and was caught by the guards. Unfortunately, the hood did not save him from the executioner's noose. STATS: Traits: Immune to backstab and poison when equipped Weight: 2 Used by: Thieves~ /*This hefty tome attempts a complete history of the Neverwinter Wood, but the crux of what is known is summed up in the following passage:
While many a tale has suggested that there are dark forces that call the wood their home, there is yet no definite answer as to what truly hides within. Many a glade has a guardian force watching over it, but never one so malevolent as is supposedly in residence there. These woods have never been logged by men, for they are feared and shunned by locals, and even orc hordes alter their course around and never through, though usually only after suffering a goodly number of stubborn casualties.*/
@103764 = ~NP: vial of poison~ /*Acid Flask*/
@103765 = ~NP: In the absence of other arguments, poison becomes the best choice for most dark personalities. With a skillful approach, one can quickly and effectively turn one's weapon into a poisoned one, even a small scratch from which becomes a festering wound, more dangerous than an ax blow. This vial contains enough poison to cover a weapon once. PARAMETERS: Features: - Can be used for one-time poison coverage, like the ability of a character with a killer whale. A poisoned weapon follow-up hits the target with poison, dealing 1 damage per second for 24 seconds (3 damage for the first 6 seconds). The saving throw against poison limits the total damage to 12 points. Weight: 1 Used by: Thieves~ /*Type of Feat: ClassPrerequisite: Shifter, Epic Druid.
Specifics: The character with this ability can take the shape of a red, green, black, white or blue wyrmling three times per day. He gains the wyrmling's signature ability, its breath weapon. As the shifter rises in levels, the damage potential of the breath weapon increases. 
Use: Selected. After choosing the ability, the character must select which kind of wyrmling he wants to transform into.*/
@103766 = ~NP: Return Throwing Dagger +1~ /*You strike  with the ritual dagger.*/
@103767 = ~NP: Being the weapon of most fast and agile warriors, throwing daggers are easy on everything and very easy to hide. While these weapons cannot deal serious damage, the speed with which they can be thrown gives them a big advantage over heavier weapons. This particular dagger's stats have been magically enhanced, apparently by order of the shadow thieves. However, it does not have any identifying marks. The magical properties have increased the potential of his attacks, and - even more valuable about him - he can return to the owner's hand after being thrown, ensuring that he is always equipped for battle. PARAMETERS: THAC0: +1 bonus Damage: 1D4 +1 Damage type: throwing (piercing) Weight: 1 Speed factor: 1 Skill type: Daggers Type: 1-manual Requirements: 3 strength Unused: Cleric/Priest~ /*Type of Feat: ClassPrerequisite: Assassin.
Specifics: At 1st level, an Assassin may use a death attack, which functions similarly to a sneak attack in that if the target is not in combat they become victim to the death attack. The successful attack forces the target to make a Fortitude save or become paralyzed. Even if they succeed with the saving throw they still suffer +1d6 points of damage in addition to the normal damage the attack caused. This damage increases to 2d6 at level 3,  3d6 at level 5, 4d6 at level 7, and 5d6 at level 9.

@103772 = ~NP: Poison Sword~ /*Noxious Ogre*/
@103773 = ~NP: These swords are usually referred to as double-edged, fighting or military swords. The blade vibrates slightly in your hand, clearly indicating that it is filled with magic, in addition, the blade of this sword is poisoned. These swords are commonly used by select half-orcs, although other races are capable of wielding such a sword. PARAMETERS: THAC0: +3 Damage: 1D8 +3 On a failed save, the target is poisoned for 2 rounds and takes 2 damage per second. Damage Type: Slashing Speed Factor: 2 Skill Type: Longsword Type: One-Handed Weight: 2 Requirement: Strength 6 Unused: Druids Priests Mages~ /*Like so many gnome inventions, this marvel of ingenuity had its origin in a profoundly stupid idea. Engineers needed a way to clean up the tacks that were cluttering the floor of their workshop.

Once they got over their disappointment, they began mass-producing the suits and selling them to their neighbors.*/
@103774 = ~NP: Blessed katana~ /*Bless Weapon*/
@103775 = ~NP: This unique katana is crafted by the finest smiths in Neverwinter. They managed to reforge a simple enchanted katana by adding some adamatine ore to it. The result is a katana with amazing properties. It is so easy to use that even a not very successful hit on the enemy causes significant damage to the enemy and damages the armor. The wielder of this katana can handle it much better and faster than any other katana.

@103780 = ~NP: Desert Wind Scimitar~ /*Scimitar of Speed*/
@103781 = ~NP: This unique scimitar is crafted by the best blacksmiths in Neverwinter. They managed to reforge a simple enchanted scimitar by adding some adamatine ore to it. The result is a scimitar with amazing properties. It is so easy to use that even a not very successful hit on the enemy causes significant damage to the enemy and damages the armor. The wielder of this scimitar can handle it much better than any other scimitar. In addition, the owner of this scimitar can twice a day, without harm to himself, burn enemies who surround him with solar fire.

@103782 = ~NP: Fairy Dust Short Sword~ /*Drow Shortsword +1*/
@103783 = ~NP: This unusual sword is crafted by the finest smiths in Neverwinter. How they managed to make this masterpiece from a simple short sword remains a mystery, it is only known that for this the blacksmiths needed magic dust. The Fairy Dust Sword is simply filled with fairy magic, it is able to blind enemies, make its owner invisible, and shock enemies with electricity. In addition, picking up this weapon, its owner becomes more dexterous. STATS: Equipped: Agility: +1 Ability to cast spells: 2 times per day &quot;Glittering Dust&quot; (Blinds enemies) 1 time per day &quot;Fairy Dust&quot; (Invisible to allies) Combat abilities: 70% chance to inflict one of the following effects : Blindness on enemy (30%) Invisibility on self (30%) Insect swarm on enemy (10%) THAC0: +4 Damage: 1d6 +4 +2 electricity Speed factor: 1 Skill type: Short sword Damage type: Piercing Type: 1-manual Requirements: Strength 5 Weight: 2 Cannot use: Druid Priest Mage~ /*This blade is almost as nasty as the personality that now permanently resides within it.

The long-dead mage has been within the weapon for quite a while but has not gotten much use, seeing as for decades the primary user was even deader than Enserric. ...hmmm. Deader? More dead? Can something be more dead? This is exactly the sort of question that makes Enserric clam up and begin muttering in pure agitation...*/
@103784 = ~NP: golden saber~ /*Golden Armor Suit*/
@103785 = ~NP: This magical saber appears to be made of gold, and its hilt is richly adorned with precious stones. The saber deals very little basic damage, but nevertheless it is a formidable weapon, there is no defense against it. It is enchanted as a +6 weapon and deals an additional 1 point of damage with all types of damage. In addition, any merchant will undoubtedly give a high price for it.

But not all enemies of the owner of the sword suffer from hellfire, these are only good characters and trolls. Apparently, this sword is from the underworld itself, it also protects the owner from fire and sucks the life out of the victim, passing it on to its owner.

@103874 = ~Protector~
@103875 = ~NP: This strange-looking shield is woven from large intertwined branches with leaves. The unusual shape and size of these leaves suggest that they were taken from ancient oaks growing deep in the Forest of Peace. If you carefully examine it, you can find powerful druidic spells emanating from the surface of the shield and increasing the health of the owner and healing his wounds faster. Every morning, at sunrise, one of the branches flares faintly for a moment. Then it can be taken and planted in the ground, and another will immediately grow in its place.

This includes the effects of spells, potions, and magical items such as wands. Unlike normal dispel magic, this spell removes all protective magical effects, such as stone skin or magical armor or weapons. The chance of a successful dispel is determined by the level of the caster and the level of magic being dispelled. The initial chance of a successful dispel is 50%. For each level of the caster that is greater than the initial dispel level, the chance of a successful dispel is increased by 5%. For each caster level less than the initial dispel level, the chance of success is reduced by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if the caster is 10 levels higher than the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Likewise, if the caster is 4 levels below the magic they are trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Accordingly, if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster, the spell will be useless.~ /*Caster Level(s): Wizard / Sorcerer 9Innate Level: 9

@103984 = ~NP: Thinker Chotoga~ /*Give Gold*/
@103986 = ~NP: This rare helmet owes its existence to a single orc, warrior and mage. The amazing story of Chotoga began when his village was accidentally destroyed in a battle between two factions of wizards. One of the winners, the sorcerer Shandellon, felt pangs of conscience when he saw the affected village, and in order to atone for his guilt, he took the only survivor with him and raised the young orc as his own son. Under the guidance of Chandellon, Chothog began to master magic, despite his origins. However, Chotog had to put in a lot more effort than the people who studied under Chandellon, and he achieved less. The orc became jealous and locked himself in his room for several days, working without rest on a subject that would allow him to surpass other students. The fruit of his labors was a helmet, rather ugly, but with a striking property to significantly increase the wearer's intelligence. Chothog immediately put on his treasure. However, he soon discovered that ignorance is the best gift for a jealous orc whose existence is so miserable. Chandellon found the charred remains of his adopted son, all wearing a now blackened helmet, next to a short note: &quot;Some ideas are best left unexecuted.&quot; Thinker Chotoga increases the wearer's Intellect by 2 and grants a +1 bonus to defense class. However, this Ork-style helmet is therefore heavy and ugly. Thus, it reduces Charisma by 2, and to wear it requires a Strength of at least 17.

"I do not know if that is true. I am not sure of anything anymore except that I have Fallen. Fallen out of love with my lord, my people and my God. I am alone in a world where there is no justice and no hope and I cannot... I cannot get these thoughts out of my mind.

"They burn my every waking moment and whisper to me in my dreams. I shall go mad, I think, if I am not mad already. To do the wrong thing seems far better, however, than to do nothing at all. I am on this path now, and it goes only forward... perhaps at its end I shall find my own justice and the dreams will stop.

When Lina grew up a little, she was sent to the magical &quot;School of Gifts&quot; Gaedolin Sentristi, suggesting that she would follow in the footsteps of her parents in the study of magic. But by chance, her fate was sealed with Sekhanin's faith. The fact is that Lina was constantly haunted by misfortunes, and when she once again got into trouble, she was saved by Sehanin Moonbow herself. She smiled and kissed Lina on the forehead. &quot;My child,&quot; she said, &quot;you have gone beyond the bounds of luck.&quot; Green light enveloped her body, she stepped back and disappeared. Subsequently, Lina learned about the true reason for such attention of the goddess to her person, it turns out that Sehanin had high hopes for Lina in fulfilling a very important mission. Sehanin thinks that perhaps one day an elven priestess will bring a volcanic oak seed to Evereska as a symbol of the rebirth of the elven people, and that priestess will be Lina La'neral.~ /*It was a fairly straight-forward test.

To complete the ritual of smoke you must cast the blessed powders on the sacred brazier so that their combinations match the descending order of the stones set into the brazier's base.

The ritual of light can only be completed using the stones drawn from the holy pool in the center of the pillars. Begin by choosing any two of the single stones set in the primary color pools. The secondary pools must then be filled with the twin gems that match the corresponding color that would be created by combining the hues of the stones in the primary pool.

However, determining the proper spell to cast on the components once they were combined in my laboratory was not as simple as I had at first assumed.

My error came in looking for an obscure solution, and missing the stunningly obvious answer right in front of me. Of course the necessary spell to create a Staff of Command is Dominance.

When flipped or turned drifting flakes of snow swirl and settle over the figures within the globe, covering the tiny world in a blanket of purest white.

I then escalated the proceedings by summoning a great bear to devour her canine champion.

"Nebacha was not expecting such a bold move. Caught off guard, she summoned a great red dragon, a classic case of panicked over-reaction. Needless to say the wyrm was enraged at her foolishness, and promptly devoured her.

The ritual is most effective when used upon a newly hatched wyrm whose growth has been accelerated using spells and enchantments; a beast whose mind is still empty and pure. Only these have the vitality and energy of youth necessary to prolong the life of the mighty Klauth. 

The creature to be absorbed must be lured or trapped within the center of the ritual room, and the dragon sphere must be placed upon the pedestal. The dragon's body will be instantly consumed even as its very life force is sucked into the sphere itself for Klauth to feed on at his leisure.

But a warning, lest you displease the master and suffer his terrible wrath: should a dead dragon's body be absorbed, the sphere must be destroyed immediately. If it is mistakenly presented to Klauth he may devour the essence of the dead wyrm, poisoning him and dealing his awesome might a crippling blow.~

The first of such robes was said to have been made by a Halruaan Lliira-worshipper named Persephenon.  An unusual Halruaan, Persephenon showed talent for sorcery rather than wizardry.  This social stigma, combined with his pursuit of the Joybringer's path and his flamboyant personality, put Persephenon at odds with his contemporaries.

Despite these obstacles, Persephenon was appointed captain of a skyship.  He made his robe as a tribute to Lliira, in order to paint rainbows across the sky as he flew.

This undignified behavior ultimately lost Persephenon his captaincy and later led to his exile from Halruaa.  Welcomed in Luiren by the less-rigid halfling culture, Persephenon enjoyed a happy life and copies of his robes have similarly enjoyed a favored place among the hin bards.*/

@107521 = ~NP: Blue dragon armor~
@107522 = ~NP: The Year of Dragon Fury (1018 LD) brought great destruction to the Central Regions, but not only to the people there. Dragons fell, littering the battlefield with their corpses. The looters then stripped the weapons and armor from the slain, and skinned the dragons. Several sets of blue dragon armor were created, but the names of the creator and the dragons whose skins were used are unknown to anyone. In an unfathomable way, the blacksmith Cromwell has figured out the secret to making this armor and has recreated it for you.

The head of Obould Many-Arrows has been delivered to Rolkid of the Mighty lance, and the threat to the Lords' Alliance supply lines has been well and truly vanquished.~
@107582 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

Commander Damas has promised to reward anyone who can destroy the catapults attacking Fort Ilkard.~
@107584 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

With the Uthgardt catapults destroyed, Captain Damas is determined to end the siege of Fort Ilkard. He has promised a reward to anyone who can bring him the head of Arness, the Elk tribe sub-chieftain in charge of the forces laying siege to Fort Ilkard.~
@107585 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

Zokan has explained that the Elk tribe have allied against the Lords' Alliance because of Commander Damas' terrible betrayal; the Commander infected blankets with the Wailing Death and gave them to the Elk tribe as gifts. These blankets are proof of his crime. The Elk Tribe within the Fort will keep peace with you while you remain their emissary, but likely those further away will not have received word as yet. If his people could be cured, Zokan would cease the alliance with the Luskan forces, and all the Elk Tribe would keep the peace.~
@107586 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

Commander Damas has admitted he infected the Elk tribe with the Wailing Death. However, he feels no remorse for his actions. A difficult moral decision lies ahead - deliver the plague cure to Zokan Thunderer and save the Elk tribe, or bring the chieftain's severed head to Commander Damas and collect the offered reward.~
@107587 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

With the siege on Fort Ilkard ended, Captain Damas seeks to destroy the Elk tribe once and for all. He has offered a reward to anyone who can get to their enclave in the west and bring back the head of their chieftain, Zokan Thunderer.~
@107588 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

With the head of Zokan Thunderer delivered into his lap, Commander Damas and Fort Ilkard have little to fear from the Elk tribe any longer.~
@107743 = ~The Siege of Fort Ilkard

The Elk tribe have been cured of the plague they contracted from the infected blankets - a gift from Commander Damas of Fort Ilkard.~
@107596 = ~Working for Akulatraxas

The green dragon Akulatraxas has been under attack from hill giants seeking to steal her eggs. She has offered treasure from her hoard to anyone who brings her the hill giant chieftain's head, telling them to seek out the hill giants' lair west of her cave.~
@107597 = ~Working for Akulatraxas

The head of the hill giant chieftain has been given to the green dragon Akulatraxas, ending the threat to her eggs.~
@107598 = ~Snow Globe

The Word of Power has been recovered from inside the snow globe, destroying the miniature world within and freeing the dwarves and dryads from their their endless torment.~
@107599 = ~Rolgan's trial is over. The young man undoubtably owes his life to the brilliant case presented by defense council. 
Neurik is elated with the unanimous verdict, for such an overwhelming verdict forces even the soldiers of the Lords' Alliance to admit (grudgingly) that justice has been served.~
@107600 = ~Rolgan's trial is over. The unfortunate young man's decapitated head staring from atop the pike outside the Temple door is stark evidence of the poor case presented by his defense council. 
No doubt this outcome will increase tensions between the Uthgardt and the Lords' Alliance.~
@107601 = ~The Final Battle

Morag has been destroyed. And with the Queen's death, the threat of the Old Ones return is no more. Without Morag's power to sustain them spirit of the Luskan horde is broken and the invaders are quickly routed by the newly inspired Neverwinter forces.~
@107602 = ~The Final Battle

The fourth Word of Power has been recovered and brought to Haedraline... but perhaps it is already too late. Morag's strength has grown too powerful, her return is inevitable. The only way to stop her now is to use the Words of Power to enter the Source Stone beneath Castle Never's dungeons and destroy Morag once and for all.~
@107603 = ~The Final Battle

Haedraline has revealed that the fourth and final Word of Power is in the hands of Maugrim. The mad prophet plans to use its power to awaken Morag and the Old Ones from their hibernation within the Source Stone so they may once again enslave all of Faerun.
The only way to stop the Old Ones' return is to find the fourth Word of Power and bring it to Haedraline before Queen Morag grows strong enough to awaken her people. There is word that Maugrim is hiding out in the war zone south of the city, protected by the Luskan forces.~
@107604 = ~The Final Battle

Led by Aribeth and Maugrim the Luskan forces have all but overrun Neverwinter. Even slaying the leaders might not be enough to turn the tide of battle at this point. Aarin Gend feels Haedraline, the mysterious lizard creature now languishing in the dungeons of Castle Never, might know a way to save the city. Only she can reveal the secrets of the Words of Power and the recently discovered Source Stone, although there is hope that Master Ford - presently studying the Source Stone in the caverns beneath the dungeon of Castle Never - might have some information to share as well.~
@107605 = ~Beggar's Nest: Aldo and Hector

A family is guarding a broken-down wagon in the center of the Beggar's Nest. They will not leave until Hector has returned. Hector is out searching the Beggar's Nest looking for parts for the wagon.~
@107606 = ~Beggar's Nest: Aldo and Hector

Parts to fix the wagon could not be found, so there was no more reason for Aldo's halfling family to stay with it. They have abandoned it to try and escape the district.~
@107607 = ~Beggar's Nest: Aldo and Hector

Encountered Hector, who was trying to find parts for his master Aldo's wagon. He's dead.~
@107608 = ~Wailing Death and the Waterdhavian creatures

She awaits the return of the remaining three beasts in the company of her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne. Once all have been found, the ritual to create the cure can commence.~

Significant strides have been made in the fight against the Wailing Death and those behind it. Two of the Waterdhavian creatures - sent by Khelben Arunsun and lost in the attack on the Neverwinter Academy - have been recovered, and have been delivered to Lady Aribeth in the Hall of Justice. She awaits the return of the remaining two beasts in the company of her lover, Abbot Fenthick Moss, and her peer, Watchknight of Helm, Desther Indelayne.

@107623 = ~Beggar's Nest: A Missing Brother

Jemanie is worried about his brother, Torin. He has been missing for several days now, and Jemanie fears that something has happened to him. Apparently he was involved with a strange cult that may have something to do with the zombie infestation. The group has an estate in the northeast of the Beggar's Nest.~
@107624 = ~Beggar's Nest: A Missing Brother

The body of Jemanie's brother Torin was found beneath the cultist estate in the Beggar's Nest. He apparently outlived whatever use the cult and its new master had for him. There was a ring on the corpse that Jemanie would probably like to have returned.~
@107625 = ~Beggar's Nest: A Missing Brother

Jemanie has been told of his brother's death. He was understandably upset and would not be consoled.~

@107669 = ~South Road: Poor Neva

A young man by the name of Neva has apparently been kidnapped by bandits. According to his siblings, Tarran and Jaheel, he is being held near some standing stones by the entrance to the Charwood. Adventurers are to meet the siblings there to attempt a rescue.~
@107671 = ~South Road: Poor Neva

Neva, a young man supposedly kidnapped by bandits near the edge of the Charwood, turned out to be little more than bait in a deadly trap. A letter was recovered from Neva's corpse, identifying the trio as cult agents. According to the letter, further agents have been sent to Neverwinter Woods, the Charwood, and the hills north of Port Llast, in search of an unnamed artifact of great power.~

@107710 = ~The florid, swooping, elongated hand in which this manuscript is written leaves little doubt as to its author. The wizard's mark on the inside cover further confirms that this is indeed one of the many tomes of magical item construction written by Hasuraman the Muddled.
"The fashioning of the magical footwear known as Gargoyle Boots (or, as some insist on calling them, Boots of the Gargoyle) is an involved and difficult process not to be lightly undertaken.
 
Before beginning the procedure it is imperative that one perform said procedure within the confines of a proper mage's laboratory to avoid contaminations that would render the procedure ineffective.

As one might imagine, the primary ingredient is the skull of the creature that gives its name to the footwear. 
The skull must then be combined with a bodak's tooth and subjected to a stoneskin spell in order to complete the construction of said item."~
@107711 = ~Tome of Robes~

"Though an item of great use and application, the Crystal Robe is not without its peculiar failings. However, those willing to accept the drawbacks will be more than happy to reap the benefits of said item if they precisely follow my instructions, as follow:

Combine the belly of a fire beetle with one flawless quartz crystal in an appropriate magic container (the like of which can be found in any respectable wizard's laboratory). 

Once the respective ingredients are in place, enchant them with an enervation spell to create the Crystal Robes."~
@107713 = ~Tome of the Amulet~

"Though the secrets are known to me, the creation of the Amulet of Natural armor is not an endeavor I am likely to undertake, for reasons that at first glance should be obvious.

Fenberry, the complimentary component, presents no particular difficulty to the intrepid mage who wishes to acquire it in any substantial quantity. 

However, the primary ingredient - the tongue of a slaad - poses challenges far beyond the capabilities of most. In the unlikely event one should encounter and defeat one of these demonic beings, the casting of Mage Armor is the only further requirement to obtaining the desired amulet.

Needless to say, anyone attempting the process beyond the confines of a carefully controlled environment such as a mage's laboratory would be doomed to encounter failure and disappointment."~

@107722 = ~NP: The humble wizard Huhhus discovered a sure way to make a rejuvenating potion from troll flesh, but few were willing to drink the vile liquid, so the experiment was deemed a failure. Later, one of his students decided to create a regeneration ring filled with ichor and troll brains. External application did not cause such disgust and gained much more success.

@107723 = ~Amulet of Natural Armor +4~
@107724 = ~NP: When the warrior Thelenn grew old and could no longer participate in battles, he became a trainer teaching local youths martial arts.

@107725 = ~Gargoyle Boots~
@107726 = ~NP: Legend has it that the magician who created the Gargoyle Boots imbued them with the spirit of a real gargoyle. Unfortunately, these boots did not protect their hapless creator from the revenge of the gargoyle fiancé. And the fact that there are several pairs of such boots only proves that all this is fiction, an attempt to explain the durability that Gargoyle Boots give to the owner.

Mithran was known for his love of wandering and his favorable attitude towards &quot;N'TelQuessir&quot; or &quot;not-of-the-folk&quot; - not the elves of this world. The cape was his undoing, having been woven and enchanted by his dark elf mistress, Rauva Wrynn. The very appearance of this dark blue cloak is so non-elven that it arouses suspicion. A drow hunter named Gaedel, an acquaintance of Mithran, accidentally discovered Rauva's dwelling in the forests surrounding Myth Nantar. With a small group of warriors, Gaedel quickly burned the hut and killed her herself. When Mitran found out what had happened, he went mad with rage. The mad magician razed Gaedel's hunting lodge to the ground and killed all his brothers. The Gaedel family sought revenge by killing Mithran, even at the cost of their lives. The cape was discovered by his close friend, the dwarf warrior Hael Bronzeskin. It is not known for certain, but it is said that she died in the waves that engulfed Myth Nantar when the proud city sank to the bottom of the Sea of Fallen Stars several years later. PARAMETERS: Bonus to Defense Class: 3 Bonus to Saving Throws: +2~ /*This hefty tome attempts a complete history of the Neverwinter Wood, but the crux of what is known is summed up in the following passage:

Many a glade has a guardian force watching over it, but never one so malevolent as is supposedly in residence there. These woods have never been logged by men, for they are feared and shunned by locals, and even orc hordes alter their course around and never through, though usually only after suffering a goodly number of stubborn casualties.*/
