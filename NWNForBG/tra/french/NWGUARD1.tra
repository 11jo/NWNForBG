@0 = ~Can I help you? I cannot be away from my duty for long. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they're replacing the ones we've lost...~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Hmm, the more information you have, the less risk you'll pose to the rest of us on duty. I'll help if I can.~
@4 = ~You know anything about the bad plague?~
@5 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@6 = ~Stay alive out there, recruit.~
@7 = ~I know what I'm told. Aribeth and her lot handle all the delicate stuff. We common guards keep the peace where we can and maintain the quarantine at all costs.~
@8 = ~You sound like you don't particularly like Aribeth.~
@9 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@10 = ~All I hear is how bad things are getting, how many more men we've lost. It's like a war, except you can't make the Wailing surrender. With us gone, the different districts each hold their intrigues, I'm sure. All I know is that we're fighting a losing battle, even here in the Core...~ 
@11 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@12 = ~She handles city security on a big scale, reporting to Lord Nasher. She brings in people like you for special missions, leaving us for little things like, oh, restraining plague-maddened rioters. Pardon me if I don't think she's more important than the dozens of us who have already been put to the torch thanks to the Wailing's touch!~ 
@13 = ~Not a thing. I was briefed on the Waterdhavian creatures, but nothing since. My life's on the line to keep the streets clear of rioters and looters. I do know that those damned Helmites keep getting in our way, though. I swear, their blessings better do HALF of what they say.~ 
@14 = ~What were you told about the Waterdhavian creatues?~
@15 = ~That the caravan bringing them was attacked when it entered the city. Nobody knows what happened to them after that - scattered to the wind, I guess. The cure attempt they were for is still up in the air, I guess. They don't tell me about details. They just said keep an eye out for them.~
