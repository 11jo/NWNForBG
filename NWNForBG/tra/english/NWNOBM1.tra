@0 = ~Why are you in my home? What business do you have here? None lawful, I'll wager.~
@1 = ~I'm with the city guard, I don't mean any harm.~
@2 = ~Get out of my way! I'll go where I please!~
@3 = ~I was just leaving.~
@4 = ~MT: Oh. Yes, you don't look so bad. You just scared me when you barged in uninvited, that's all. Then what do you need<SIRMAAM> ?~ /*Oh. I suppose you don't look like such a bad sort. You just startled me by barging in here uninvited, is all.*/
@5 = ~I'm investigating the plague. Perhaps you can help me?~
@6 = ~Do you know of anything interesting going on in Blacklake?~
@7 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@8 = ~I'm collecting gold to protect nobles. Many are killed in their own homes everyday.~
@9 = ~Goodbye.~
@10 = ~Very well, but keep your distance. I don't recognize you, so you likely slipped past the barricade and may have brought the plague with you.~
@11 = ~What is this? Another lout pushing through my home? Well, let me save you some time. If you were going to rob me, someone already beat you to it!~
@12 = ~I suppose that makes you a burglar of some sort? Come to rob me, have you?~
@13 = ~Perhaps I will! Give me all your gold or die!~
@14 = ~Yes, leave me be.~
@15 = ~I have paid close attention to what has been said of the plague, but there is little real information. I don't know if I can help you.~
@16 = ~Are you aware of any strange creatures in the area?~
@17 = ~Have you heard any rumors concerning the plague?~
@18 = ~MT: I would like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@19 = ~I'm certain that I am above anything you would consider "interesting."~
@20 = ~Anything peculiar that you can think of?~
@21 = ~I'd be interested in work, if you know of anything.~
@22 = ~Any places in Blacklake you think I should visit?~
@23 = ~Unless you are asking for the way out of my home, I doubt I can help you.~
@24 = ~Where is the nearest inn?~
@25 = ~Where is the nearest temple?~
@26 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@27 = ~Actually, I'd rather ask you about something else.~
@28 = ~You don't say? Nobles dying in (gulp) their own homes? Hypothetically, would you mean nobles like me... in my home?~
@29 = ~MT: Presumably? Yes. If you don't &quot;donate&quot;, you may die. Maybe even NOW!~ /*Hypothetically? Yes. Unless you "donate," you could die. Maybe even RIGHT NOW! Or NOW!*/
@30 = ~Perhaps I should just go back to my other questions.~
@31 = ~I'll just leave. Sorry to bother you.~
@32 = ~MT: All clear. Okay, take your damned gold and get out. I don't have time to listen to your nonsense. Pick up and go! And don't come back! Animal! Dog!~ /*I thought so. Fine, take your bloody gold and get out! I don't have time to be listening to your evil posturing. Take it and go!*/
@33 = ~Certainly not. The Blacklake maintains strict control on all animals. There is even a zoo, but there is hardly anything there I would call strange.~
@34 = ~Is it possible that some creatures might have gained access to the zoo, somehow?~
@35 = ~So there's been nothing odd about the zoo, then?~
@36 = ~I pay no attention to the ramblings of the lower classes, and I assure you that Blacklake nobles do not spread rumors. I cannot help you.~
@37 = ~Very well... but make it quick. I'm not sure what you are up to...~
@38 = ~I'm collecting a tax to help me keep the streets free of crime.~
@39 = ~Nothing. Well, there was some sort of affair with Lord Meldanen, but it has apparently been resolved. I assume it was some sort of scandal.~
@40 = ~Mmm, nothing comes to mind. At least, nothing now that Formosa and Meldanen are no longer at each other's throats.~
@41 = ~MT: I don't know. This tavern, Naked Plank? They say she just has a scandalous reputation. Would you like to know something else?~ /*I don't know. That tavern, the Board Laid Bare? It has quite a scandalous reputation, I hear.*/
@42 = ~MT: I think you should go to the Naked Board. It's more like a tavern. I can't tell you more. I don't like such places. It's in the center of the area.~ /*The Board Laid Bare, I believe. A tavern mostly. I can't tell you any more. Not my sort of place. It is by the south gate.*/
@43 = ~MT: We do not have such facilities. Those who need such a place usually go to the Heart of the City. Anything else?~ /*We have no such establishment. Those that need such a place used to travel to the City Core.*/
@44 = ~MT: I think they sell supplies at Naked Plank, but I've never been there. It's in the center of the area.~ /*I imagine they sell supplies at the Board Laid Bare, but I have not been there myself. It is by the south gate.*/
@45 = ~Stop right there! I've already given out the last of my gold and there isn't any more! Now, ask your questions and get out!~
@46 = ~I understand. Take your damn gold and get out. Out! Criminal! Dog!~
@47 = ~All right then. Whatever you were up to, I don't want to see you back.~
@48 = ~MT: No I do not think so. Owner - Lord Montgomery &quot;Precise Shot&quot;. If you want an accurate answer, talk to him personally. If you have not been there yet, then know that the zoo is in the northeastern part of the district.~ /*I couldn't say. Lord Montgomery "Sureshot" is the proprietor. You will have to speak with him if you wish a definitive answer.*/
@49 = ~I have no idea what you are looking for, or would consider "odd." The zoo's in the northeast if you want to see for yourself.~
@50 = ~Lord Meldanen has been stirring up trouble, but I do not wish to speak of it.~
@51 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@52 = ~Are you sure you couldn't say, handsome?~
@53 = ~MT: Well, this Formosa girl is looking for people who will agree to listen to her. She's in the southeast square, inciting people to turn against Meldanen. I don't pay attention to troublemakers like her. Everyone must do their job. Whatever Meldanen has in mind, it's none of my business, none of her business. Would you like to know something else?~ /*I don't pay attention to troublemakers like her. Everyone should be left to their own affairs. Whatever Meldanen is up to, it's no business of hers or mine.*/
@54 = ~MT: Well, actually, how does a wizard know, right? Well... there are rumors that recently Meldanen has brought a young woman and is having fun with her. He doesn't let her out, there are rumors that she is very strange... Probably not quite human. Some gods know what he wants from her. Disgusting, isn't it? In any case, if you want, you can see for yourself. Meldanen's estate in the northwest. But I do not advise you to go there... He will not receive you.~ /*He won't let her out, and the rumors say that she's rather strange...perhaps not quite human. The gods only know what he wants with her. Rather sordid business, no?*/
@55 = ~MT: Well, I will not refuse to spend some more time in your fine company. Come closer. As I was told, recently Meldanen got a young woman for his entertainment. He doesn't let her out, and rumor has it that she's acting very strange... maybe she's not human at all. Only the gods know what he wants from her. Dirty business, right? Well, if you want, you can see for yourself. Meldanen's mansion is in the northwest. Only I do not advise you to go there ... it is unlikely that he will be delighted with you.~ /*Well now, I wouldn't mind spending a few more moments in your delightful company. Lean in close, now. From what I've heard, Meldanen recently accquired a young woman for his amusement.*/
@56 = ~MT: Um... No, I don't think I'm going to go into all the details. I don't find your manners... uh... appropriate. And besides, Meldanen is too dangerous a man to gossip about. His mansion is in the northwestern part of the district... but it's wiser to avoid him like the plague.~ /*Er... No, I don't think I shall go into the subject in detail. I don't find your manner... eh... entreating. Besides, Meldanen is a dangerous man to gossip about.*/
@57 = ~MT: I... I can't fight you. Take what I have and go... Oooh! You already stole everything I had. What else do you need? Get out!~ /*I... I can't fight you. Take what I have and go. Just go.*/
@58 = ~Villain, why are you here? This is private property!~
@59 = ~Ruffians back again, hmm? Something you need?~
@60 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@61 = ~Why have you intruded? Get out! Out! Filthy evil beast!~
