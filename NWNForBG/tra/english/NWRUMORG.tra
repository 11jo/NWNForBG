@0 = ~The local cemetery is haunted by the undead at night. Bring weapons to visit Grandma or don't visit her at all. It all started after some sorcerer from the Luskan's Arcane Brotherhood was buried there.~
@1 = ~In Luskan, the High Captains are at war with each other. That's why they closed the gates.~
@2 = ~South of the Green Gryphon, the road to Port Llast became dangerous. After Luskan stopped patrolling the road, travelers began to be attacked by creatures like orcs and bugbears. They used to sit quietly in their caves, but they say someone controls them.~
@3 = ~They say there are werewolves in Port Llast, attacking the locals at night and tearing them apart. Now they've gotten here, people saw a werewolf near the tavern the other day.~
@4 = ~There's a nasty cult in the area. They say Lady Aribeth herself is here to catch them.~
@5 = ~Five dangerous criminals have escaped from Waterdeep's prison. It's doubtful, but still possible, that they went straight here. There's a minotaur who's taken up residence here, locked himself in his room and won't come out, only demanding food and ale. So I wondered if he's a criminal, he looks like a bandit.~
@6 = ~There's been no word from Charwood for a long time. Rumor has it there's a lot of undead, ghosts, it's creepy.~
@7 = ~Neverwinter Wood is best not to go there. They say the animals there have gone wild, even the deer and rabbits are attacking everyone.~
