@1 = ~NP: You may not be the most agile soldier in camp, but you sure know how to do your job, right?~ /*You may not be the swiftest soldier in the camp, <CHARNAME>, but you sure know how to get the job done.*/
@2 = ~NP: I'm told the Luscan army is ruled by mages from the Brotherhood of the Mysteries. It is good that we have such powerful mages on our side as you have in your squad.~ /*I hear the Luskan army is run by mages from the Arcane Brotherhood. It's a good thing we've got a powerful spellcaster like you on our side, <CHARNAME>.*/
@3 = ~(sigh) I'd take you back to my bunk, handsome, but heroes like you are too valuable to be locked away in the bedroom during times like these.~
@4 = ~NP: Everyone talks about what you've done for Neverwinter... But no one ever mentions how beautiful you are!~ /*Everyone's talking about everything you've done for Neverwinter, <CHARNAME>... but they don't mention how handsome you are!*/
@5 = ~You must be one of those mercenaries Gend has hired to search for the Words of Power. I wish you luck.~
@6 = ~NP: It is said that Aaryn Gend has sent you on a quest to find the Words of Power. A pity - <MALEFEMALE> like you could be of great use to us on the front lines.~ /*Word is Aarin Gend has you searching for the Words of Power, <CHARNAME>. Too bad - we could use a good <MANWOMAN> like you up on the front.*/
@7 = ~NP: I'm going to the front tomorrow. Maybe I'll get a chance to prove myself and become a hero like you!~ /*I'm shipping off to the front tomorrow, <CHARNAME>. Maybe I'll get a chance to prove myself and become a hero like you!*/
@8 = ~Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we're fighting for before we ship off to the front.~
@9 = ~My, my. Hello there, handsome. You come to save us from the big, bad Luskan army?~
