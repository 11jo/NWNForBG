@0 = ~NP: It's you! I know you! You<CHARNAME> ,<CLASS> ! It is to you that Neverwinter owes its salvation from the plague! A... uh, unique... face like yours is hard to miss. Your looks are legendary in the city<SIRMAAM> . As well as about your exploits. We are humble servants of the city, and it is a great honor for us to be in your presence,<CHARNAME> .~ /*A face as... uh, unique... as yours is not easy to miss in a crowd. Your looks are something of a legend in the city, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. As are your deeds.*/
@1 = ~Alas, it seems the city has need of your aid once again, if we hope to drive these Luskan dogs off! Will you join our cause, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@2 = ~Who are you? What are you doing in here?~
@3 = ~Cause? What cause?~
@4 = ~It's time for me to leave.~
@5 = ~NP: I am Trankar, commander of the Neverwinter militia battalion. My men and I tried to hold the southern district of the city, but Luskan's troops invaded our territory. We were forced to retreat and establish a base here in the Heart of the City. But we don't give up! I'm still sending out small detachments to use guerrilla tactics to delay Luskan's advance.~ /*We were forced to retreat and set up our base here in the City Core. But we haven't given up the fight! I still send my men out in small groups, trying to slow the Luskan advance through guerilla tactics.*/
@6 = ~NP: Good luck. My soldiers and I will stay here and do our best to resist Luskan's forces.~ /*Good luck to you, <CHARNAME>. I shall remain here with my men, organizing what resistance we can against the Luskan invaders.*/
@7 = ~We do what we can, but our numbers are too few. Between the catapults and the war golems I fear it is only a matter of time before even the City Core falls to the Luskan scum!~
@8 = ~War golems? Catapults?~
@9 = ~Is there anything I can do to help?~
@10 = ~Sounds like you turned tail and ran, Trancar!~
@11 = ~Where are the Luskan forces now?~
@12 = ~NP: The Luskans are well prepared. It all started with the fact that catapults started bombing us wherever we moved. Our troops could not even line up properly. But even despite the boiling tar pouring from the sky, we held the position and tried to resist the enemy. And that's when the battle golems came, and we realized that there was no more hope.~ /*But even with flaming pitch falling from the sky, we held our ground and faced our enemy. That's when we met the war golems and knew we had no hope.*/
@13 = ~The huge monstrosities tore through an entire company in mere seconds, and our weapons can't even make a dent in their rock-hard hides! We had to fall back.~
@14 = ~NP: Under normal circumstances, I think that<MALEFEMALE><CLASS> alone can't change anything. But you're not just MALEFEMALE&gt;. Someone needs to destroy these catapults and stop these war golems. It won't be easy, but once you managed to save us from the plague. You may be able to save us from this disaster as well.~ /*Someone has to take out those catapults and stop those war golems. It won't be easy, but you saved us from the plague, maybe you can save us from this.*/
@15 = ~I don't have time for this. I need to find Aribeth and Maugrim!~
@16 = ~What must be done, Trancar?~
@17 = ~NP: We held on as best we could<LADYLORD> . The enemy had a huge numerical advantage. Ten to one, at least. But even so, we would have stayed and fought on if there was even a minimal chance of winning. But under the fire of catapults and the attack of war golems, we were simply crushed. My people are just simple soldiers. They don't have enough strength to withstand such an attack.~ /*We held out as long as we could, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. We were outnumbered ten to one, at least. Even then we would have stayed and fought if we had any chance at all.*/
@18 = ~NP: These dogs have surrounded us, but so far the barricades are holding them back and preventing them from entering the Heart of the City. At the moment, their main forces are trying to make a breakthrough from the south. It is there that the main battles with these damned catapults and combat golems take place. We held on as best we could, but in the end we were forced to retreat.~ /*That's where the fierciest fighting is, along with those damn catapults and war golems. We held out against them as long as we could, but in the end we had to retreat.*/
@19 = ~NP: As far as I know, these two led the attack from the south. Finding them won't be easy, but it's probably best to start your search from there. I'm just a simple soldier. I don't know what your goal is, and I don't think you want to tell me. But finding Aribeth and Maugrim will be much easier if you destroy those catapults and war golems.~ /*I'm just a simple soldier, <CHARNAME>. I don't know what mission you're on and I don't expect you to tell me. But finding Aribeth and Maugrim is going to be a lot easier if you take out those catapults and war golems.*/
@20 = ~NP: The catapults are located somewhere in the south, in the war zone. Where exactly, I don't know. They are constantly sending them from place to place. If you find them, just kill the soldiers guarding them, and then smash the catapults themselves. If you neutralize all three catapults, the stone rain will finally stop raining down on us.~ /*If you find them, just kill the soldiers guarding them and smash the catapult to bits. Destroy all three catapults and we'll finally get a break from those boulders raining down on our heads.*/
@21 = ~And the golems?~
@22 = ~NP: Battle golems are a completely different story. Even you may have difficulty if you go into battle one on one with these monsters. But there is a better way. The war golems are controlled by the mages of Luskan. Kill these wizards and the golems will turn into ordinary, albeit expensive, statues.~ /*The war golems are a different story. Even you might have trouble going head to head against those brutes, <CHARNAME>. But there's a better way.*/
@23 = ~Where can I find these wizards?~
@24 = ~NP: I do not know this. They must be close enough to control the golems, so they are most likely in the southern war zone. But if they are smart enough, they will not be substituted. Our intelligence reports that two golem lords arrived from Luskan along with the troops: the first to control the golems from the east, and the second from the western flank.~ /*That I don't know. They have to be close enough to control their golems, so they're probably in the southern war zone. But if they're smart they won't be standing out in the open.*/
@25 = ~NP: I know I'm asking a lot. But no one can do it except you. My soldiers and I have no chance.~ /*It's a lot to ask, <CHARNAME>, I know. But you're the only one who can do this. My men and I don't stand a chance.*/
@26 = ~I'll destroy the golems and the catapults for you, Trancar!~
@27 = ~Between the catapult fire and the unstoppable war golems of the enemy, the soldiers of Neverwinter can do little to stop the Luskan advance.
If the catapults could be destroyed and the wizards controlling the war golems stopped then at least the brave defenders might have a faint hope of turning back the invaders.~
@28 = ~What's in this for me?~
@29 = ~NP: I can send soldiers with you, but the more people around you, the greater the chance that you will be noticed. Do you need anything else from me? I'll do my best to help you, although I'm afraid it won't be enough.~ /*Is there something else you need of me? I will help you however I can though there is little enough I can do, I'm afraid.*/
@30 = ~Tell me about you and your men again.~
@31 = ~Where can I find the catapults?~
@32 = ~How can I stop the war golems?~
@33 = ~I'm looking for Aribeth and Maugrim.~
@34 = ~How goes the war effort?~
@35 = ~NP: So it's true what they say. Selling to the bone! I'm sorry, but I don't even have a couple of coins. Either you do it to save the city or you don't. Glory will be your only reward.~ /*So the rumors are true, you're a mercenary to the very bone! Sorry, but I don't even have two coppers to rub together.*/
@36 = ~NP: The catapults are located somewhere in the south, in the war zone. However, where exactly, I cannot say, as they are constantly moved from place to place. If you find them, just kill the soldiers guarding them, and then smash the catapults themselves. If you neutralize all three catapults, the stone rain will finally stop raining down on us.~ /*If you find them, just kill the soldiers guarding them and smash the catapult to bits. Destroy all three catapults and we'll finally get a break from those boulders raining down on our heads.*/
@37 = ~NP: The war golems that destroy everything in the southern war zone are controlled by the mages of Luskan. Kill these wizards and the golems will turn into simple, albeit expensive, statues. Our intelligence reports that two golem lords arrived from Luskan along with the troops: the first to control the golems from the east, and the second from the western flank.~ /*The war golems ravaging the southern war zone are controlled by Luskan mages. Kill the wizards and the golems are nothing but expensive statues.*/
@38 = ~Where will I find these wizards?~
@39 = ~NP: As far as I know, these two are organizing an attack in the south. Perhaps they are hiding somewhere in the war zone, surrounding themselves with security and planning the destruction of Neverwinter. They can be anywhere in the combat zone. In an abandoned house, or in an empty store. No one knows where they are... except maybe Asgard. But no one even knows if he is still alive!~ /*They could be anywhere in that war zone - inside an abandoned home, holed up in an empty shop. Nobody knows where they are... except maybe Asgard. But nobody even knows if he's still alive!*/
@40 = ~Asgard?~
@41 = ~NP: I won't lie to you... All the odds are against us. The enemy is heavily outnumbered, and we have suffered horrendous losses after being attacked by catapults and war golems. But having a hero like you on our side gives hope to our soldiers. You will find a way to save the city. I know what you will find!~ /*I won't lie to you... The odds are stacked against us. We're badly outnumbered and we took heavy losses from the catapults and war golems.*/
@42 = ~That I don't know. They have to be close enough to control their golems, so they're probably in the southern war zone. But if they're smart they won't be standing out in the open.~
@43 = ~Asgard used to be a smuggler in Neverwinter, until he lost his sight. Now he's just an old, blind man. But he knew this city inside out - the location of every hidden passage and secret hideout.~
@44 = ~Asgard might be able to help us get to Aribeth and Maugrim... if we knew where to find him. Last I heard he was living in the district just beyond the south gates, but now that it's become a warzone I doubt he's even still alive.~
@45 = ~NP: It is you! I know you! You are an ally<CHARNAME> ,<CLASS> ! It is to you that Neverwinter owes its salvation from the plague! Alas, the city needs your help again if we are ever to get rid of these Luskan dogs! Would you like to join our noble cause,<SIRMAAM> ?~ /*Alas, it seems the city has need of your aid once again, if we hope to drive these Luskan dogs off! Will you join our cause, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/
@46 = ~NP: Hello again. Has your decision changed, and you will help us in our cause? Or do you want something else?~ /*Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. Have you reconsidered and come back to aid us in our cause? Or is there something else you need?*/
@47 = ~NP: As far as I know, catapults are still pouring stone rain on us, and battle golems are still roaming the streets. But at least you managed to survive. Do you need anything else from me? I'll do my best to help you, although I'm afraid it won't be enough.~ /*The catapults still reign down upon our heads and the war golems still walk the streets, or so I hear. But at least you are still alive, <CHARNAME>.*/
@48 = ~NP: I can still hear the sound of falling rocks and the gurgling of boiling resin pouring from the sky in my ears. I'm starting to think you were killed trying to destroy those catapults. I don't think anyone but you could do it. So accept gratitude from me and my people.~ /*I can still hear the steady pounding of the stones and flaming pitch hurled at us by the enemy catapults, <CHARNAME>. I feared you had been slain trying to destroy them.*/
@49 = ~But I have reports the war golems have ground to a halt, and I think you are the only one who could have stopped them. For that, I and my men thank you.~
@50 = ~NP: Great! First you managed to save us from the plague, and now thanks to you we are no longer threatened by catapults or golems! The bards have already begun to sing songs about you. Congratulations. It seems that new legends are being made about you. And now it's time for me and my soldiers. These Luskan dogs outnumber us ten to one, but we won't give up without a fight!~ /*Your legend continues to grow, it would seem. And now is the time for me and my men. The Luskan dogs may have us outnumbered ten to one, but we won't go down without a fight!*/
@51 = ~NP: Maybe when this war is over, the bards will sing a song about Trancar and his battalion, what do you think?~ /*Maybe when this war is over the bards will sing a song for Trancar and his battalion, eh <CHARNAME>?*/
@52 = ~And a worthy song it would be, Trancar.~
@53 = ~The bards don't sing about nobodies, Trancar.~
@54 = ~I need to ask you some questions, Trancar.~
@55 = ~NP: It's very nice to hear this from you. Perhaps this is even true, if, of course, the city manages to survive in such circumstances. Maybe you need something else?~ /*Kind words, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps even true, if the city manages to survive against these odds. Was there something else you needed?*/
@56 = ~NP: These are harsh words, but they are probably true. But my people need something to hope for. Their chances of survival are already pretty slim. Do you need something?~ /*Harsh words, <CHARNAME>, but true enough I suppose. Still, my men need something to hope for. Their odds of surviving are grim enough as it is.*/
@57 = ~I need to ask you some questions, Trancar.~
@58 = ~I'll tell you what I can, though in all truth my attention has been focused on organizing resistance to the Luskan invaders.~
@59 = ~NP: Good luck. My soldiers and I will do our best to counter Luskan's forces.~ /*Good luck to you, <CHARNAME>. I shall remain here with my men, organizing what resistance we can against the Luskan invaders.*/
@61 = ~I won't lie to you... The odds are stacked against us. We're badly outnumbered and we took heavy losses from the catapults and war golems.~
@62 = ~Asgard used to be a smuggler in Neverwinter, until he lost his sight. Now he's just an old, blind man. But he knew this city inside out - the location of every hidden passage and secret hideout.~
