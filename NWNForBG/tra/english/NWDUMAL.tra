@0 = ~Greetings, I am Dumal, Watchknight of Helm. It is good to see a face of reason amidst the ravings. I suppose being caged is better than torture, but at least during those sessions I could pass out if I tired of their rhetoric.~ [NWDUMA50] /*I suppose being caged is better than torture, but at least during those sessions I could pass out if I tired of their rhetoric.*/
@1 = ~Who are you? How did you get here?~
@2 = ~What have you heard? What happened here?~
@3 = ~What do you know of this cult?~
@4 = ~The Hold was my home until it was infiltrated. A third of our number were spies... betrayers. It was terrible. They killed most of us, but we weren't even their target. It was just to support an attack somewhere else. A day ago "Desther" returned, and seemed to have a new plan. I thought I was dead for sure, but I think he's forgotten about me.~ /*They killed most of us, but we weren't even their target. It was just to support an attack somewhere else.*/
@5 = ~I have to find Desther. I have to go.~
@6 = ~Screams, mostly. I think something has gone wrong for these cult invaders. I think their agents in Neverwinter are being abandoned. Desther led them, but he is no longer needed, for some reason. Next thing you know, he's raising undead all over. It's disgusting. Looks like he's trying to gather power for himself, but I doubt this "Old One" cult will be impressed. Whether he's one of these "People of the Eye" or not, they seem done with him.~ /*Looks like he's trying to gather power for himself, but I doubt this "Old One" cult will be impressed.

@7 = ~NP: Do you know anything about these Ancients?~ /*Do you know anything specific about these "Old Ones?"*/
@8 = ~Madness! These "People of the Eye" are all fanatics, content to be a cog in their master's machine, even if it makes no sense! They attacked Neverwinter for no reason, or at least no reason they have been told! The plague would never have lasted without them. They might be based out of the north, but I've never heard of the "People of the Eye" or their "Old Ones" before.~ /*Madness!

@9 = ~I'd come with you but I wouldn't be any help. I'm too weak. If you have any other questions, I'll be here until the fighting stops.~
@10 = ~Sorry, no, I have not been in a position to ask more pointed questions, and Desther has not been forthcoming with information.~
@11 = ~I hope your battle goes well. Do you need me?~ [NWDUMA51]
