@16 = ~When I heard about the plague I was flush with the thrill of scientific discovery. I thought that if I applied the principles of observation and experimentation I could discover a cure for the plague.

@20 = ~At last I managed to locate another who could train me in the arcane arts - a human sorcerer named Prophyro who lived in a secluded tower on the far side of the island.~
@21 = ~And he took you in?~
@22 = ~NP: What surprises me is that he accepted a gnome for the training course.~ /*I'm surprised he would have accepted a gnome for training.*/
@23 = ~I admit that when I first arrived at Prophyro's tower I did not receive a warm welcome. Or rather to be more accurate, I should say I received an overly warm welcome.

@27 = ~You should have killed it!~
@28 = ~Once I had regained my wits, I realized the fire drake served a dual purpose: it was a guardian for Prophyro's estate, but it also provided a challenge for any would-be apprentices who might wish to approach him.

The problem was how to get past the creature when my magic was barely capable of igniting a candle.~ /*If I could find a way to best the creature I was certain Prophyro would see my potential and accept me as an apprentice.

@32 = ~NP: So it was an illusion?~ /*What kind of guild is this?*/
@33 = ~I simply looked at the evidence. Fire drakes are not indigenous to my island and the climate is hardly suitable for one to survive.

@34 = ~When the lizard appeared I simply ignored it. It charged straight at me, fire and smoke spewing from its jaws. But I held my ground and a split second before the beast bowled me over it disappeared in a shower of light. The door to the tower swung open. I stepped in to see an old man in robes.

@38 = ~You are right, of course. My tale can wait, we have more pressing matters to attend to right now.~

@40 = ~You are a sorcerer just as I am, <CHARNAME>. Logically I would assume our experiences in our early training were quite similar.~
@41 = ~Prophyro instilled in me the basic principles of magic and the underlying laws governing the arcane. His knowledge and wisdom were an inspiration to me, though his organizational skills were somewhat lacking. I would constantly stumble across magic items carelessly strewn about the tower.

@45 = ~I admit, seeing all those potions and wands and scrolls just lying around was difficult. And I must confess that eventually I did give in to the temptation. I just snapped.

I cleaned up Prophyro's laboratory!~ /*I just snapped. I couldn't take it anymore, and I did something rash and completely out of character.

@46 = ~What? You don't think I was foolish enough to begin tampering with things beyond the scope of my understanding, do you? I came to Prophyro so he could teach me.

@47 = ~I organized the scrolls and potions and wands.

@49 = ~NP: And what did your teacher say to that?~ /*What do I get for doing this?*/
@50 = ~What can I say, <CHARNAME>. I was young and foolish. Prophyro's own reaction was similar to yours - he couldn't believe what I had done, although he did continue to use the filing system I had set up for him.~
@51 = ~NP: With magic like that, you didn't even try to use it? What kind of magician are you?~ /*You had all that magic at your fingertips and you didn't even try to use any of it? What kind of sorcerer are you? Weren't you even curious?*/
@52 = ~Of course I was curious, <CHARNAME>, but my hunger for experimentation was tempered by reason. Imagine the damage I could have done if I had dared experiment on my own. I was an apprentice, so the sensible course of action was for me to follow the lead of my master. Any other course of action would have been... illogical.~ /*Of course I was curious, <CHARNAME>, but my hunger for experimentation was tempered by reason.

@53 = ~That's hardly an adventursome attitude.~
@54 = ~Logic and reason are fine, but they can be mighty boring.~
@55 = ~I guess your actions make sense, now that you've explained them.~
@56 = ~I admit my actions may seem overly... cautious. But that is the way of my people. Curiosity is tempered with careful analysis. However, ever since I left Lantan I find I am growing more bold in my quest for discovery.

@59 = ~You can tell me, Boddyknock. Maybe it's something I can help you with.~
@60 = ~Fine - just don't let it distract you from the job at hand!~
@61 = ~Ask me about this again later, <CHARNAME>, and I will be happy to continue my tale. But for now we should focus on your mission for Lady Aribeth.~
@62 = ~You don't have to worry about that, <CHARNAME>. I'm anxious to find the source of this foul plague, and I won't let my other interests get in the way.~
@63 = ~I told you earlier I came to Neverwinter to study the Wailing Death, <CHARNAME>. But there was another reason I came, as well. Given all that has happened, it seems rather unimportant now. But you did ask me, so I must conclude you are interested in my motivations. I have come to Neverwinter in search of bread.~ /*I told you earlier I came to Neverwinter to study the Wailing Death, <CHARNAME>. But there was another reason I came, as well.

@64 = ~NP: How's that?~ /*Who the man?*/
@65 = ~Bread?~
@66 = ~I know how foolish this sounds, but I had heard tales of a special type of bread found only here in Neverwinter - leaven bread, they call it. It is said the loaf stays fresh for months and that it will never go stale or moldy. I was hoping that when I came to Neverwinter I could find someone to teach me the secret of making this wondrous leaven bread.~ /*It is said the loaf stays fresh for months and that it will never go stale or moldy.

@67 = ~If we could determine the agents that keep the bread from spoiling I think the principles could be applied to any number of other uses!

@68 = ~I suppose someone still has a copy of the recipe somewhere, but the more I witnessed the death and suffering in this place the less important discovering the leaven bread became. I believe the discovery of the leaven bread recipe could have far reaching benefits, and I would like to someday be able to bring a copy back to my home of Lantan. But I know your mission is more important, <CHARNAME>. I will not let my scientific curiosity get in the way of your work.~ /*I suppose someone still has a copy of the recipe somewhere, but the more I witnessed the death and suffering in this place the less important discovering the leaven bread became.*/
@69 = ~I happen to have a recipe for leaven bread right here.~
@70 = ~Don't worry, Boddyknock. We'll find that recipe for you.~
@71 = ~This better not interfere with the work you're doing for me!~
@72 = ~You do? This... this is wonderful! Yes, this is exactly what I need! I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small token, perhaps, but it is all I have. Before I left Lantan I was given this ring by my master, Prophyro. He said it embodies the essence of discovery and the quest for knowledge.~ /*I have no gold or treasure to reward you, but there is one thing I can offer. A small token, perhaps, but it is all I have.*/
@73 = ~Thank you, <CHARNAME>. But for now we must return to the task at hand. Aribeth is counting on you.~
@74 = ~Never fear, <CHARNAME>. My work with you will take precedence over my search for the leaven bread recipe.~
@75 = ~Because you have helped me in discovering the miracle of this leaven bread, I feel you have earned your right to wear this ring.~
@76 = ~Thank you, Boddyknock.~
@77 = ~That's it? A cheap ring?~
@78 = ~The ring comes from the island of Lantan, island of discovery and invention. It has the power to grant insight to its wearer. I regret there is nothing else I can give you, <CHARNAME>, but once more I thank you for what you have done. But we should return our attention to greater matters now and resume your mission.

@81 = ~NP: What I said. those words were-- You disregarded things that are important to me, I don't want to talk about it anymore.~ /*Please... do excuse me. I worry so much for her safety, this is... difficult to talk about.*/
@82 = ~My knowledge of the city is quite limited, <CHARNAME>. My arrival virtually coincided with the quarantine of Neverwinter.

@85 = ~All evidence seems to indicate that our mission is progressing in the proper direction. I can't imagine what other advice to give you at this time other than to continue in the same manner as we are.~
@86 = ~With most plagues fatality rates are extremely high, but there always a few who defy the odds and survive even after contracting the illness.

@87 = ~Unfortunately I have yet to locate a single individual who has contracted this particular plague and survived. However, I would like to continue my examinations of the Beggar's Nest before I admit this problem has no solution.~

@89 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~
@90 = ~All the accounts I have gathered of the plague are in agreement that the outbreak of the Wailing Death began in the Beggar's Nest.

@92 = ~Eager as I am to conduct my research into the plague, I am not so obsessed as to throw away my life. The Beggar's Nest is all but overrun with zombies!

@96 = ~As you know, I come from Lantan - an island renowned for its inventions and scientific advances. From that you can rightly conclude that I myself am of an analytical and curious nature. You also know I am a sorcerer, and from that you can no doubt draw further conclusions - though in all truth my chosen profession is rather uncommon among the Lantanese culture.~ /*As you know, I come from Lantan - an island renowned for its inventions and scientific advances.

If you can make the fire hot enough, the flames will be absorbed into the plant and burn down to the root, killing the weed.

@146 = ~I suppose you are right, <CHARNAME>. This is a family matter, though I fear without your help I may never be able to heal the breach between my father and myself.

@147 = ~Among the great library of Lantan there are accounts of the prism blossom; a living, growing flower whose petals are said change color and reflect light as they were made of crystal.~
@148 = ~So why don't you get him one of these prism blossoms?~
@149 = ~NP: You want to find a flower like that?~ /*We should search this place.*/
@150 = ~The account of the flower occurs in only one text - the travel diary of an explorer who died several centuries ago after returning from a journey to the North. No one has ever been able to locate this rare flower or its gleaming crystal seeds, though many have spent a lifetime searching for it.

@160 = ~Although I have no reward to repay you, <CHARNAME>, there may yet be some benefit to you for aiding me in this quest.~
@161 = ~NP: Lantanaean artifacts draw their energy from a thirst for knowledge and a desire to explore. A momentous discovery may increase the powers of the ring I gave you earlier.

@166 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@167 = ~A... a hunch? I don't think you understand. Without the proper data to analyze my evaluation of the situation would result in a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin of error.

@176 = ~Aribeth's betrayal has caused me no amount of confusion, <CHARNAME>. On the one hand, her actions appear irrational and illogical - she has vowed to destroy the city she spent her life protecting. But on the other hand, isn't it logical to assume a warrior will want to avenge the death of her lover? And what about Fenthick's death, which caused this whole mess? His execution made no sense. He was not an enemy of the city and had he lived he would have done everything in his power to help Neverwinter to make up for what he had done.~ /*Aribeth's betrayal has caused me no amount of confusion, <CHARNAME>. On the one hand, her actions appear irrational and illogical - she has vowed to destroy the city she spent her life protecting.*/

@181 = ~In Lantan we bow to the laws of reason and logic. Emotion can never be truly factored out of any decision, but we do our best to look at the facts with a dispassionate eye before taking action.

We will have to familiarize ourselves with these strange lands if we hope to integrate Lantan into mainland society.~ /*In Lantan we bow to the laws of reason and logic. Emotion can never be truly factored out of any decision, but we do our best to look at the facts with a dispassionate eye before taking action.*/
@182 = ~Lantan is an island, by geography we are isolated from the rest of the world. Over the centuries this has led to an insular culture - particularly among my people, the gnomes.

But we chose not to be active participants in events.~ /*We consider ourselves safely removed from the troubles of the mainland.

@185 = ~We are thinkers, inventors and academics, <CHARNAME> - not soldiers. We plan to bring our culture and beliefs to Faerun through peaceful means - though we are proceeding in a rational and logical fashion.

@191 = ~You have not heard of the Time of Troubles, <CHARNAME>? The days when the gods were forced to take mortal form and walk among us?~
@192 = ~You are right, <CHARNAME>; I am speaking of the Time of Troubles, when the gods were forced to take mortal form and walk among us.~
@193 = ~I would share the tale with you, but the story of Gond Wonderbringer's time on Lantan is a long one, <CHARNAME>. Perhaps I will speak more of this later, but now is not the time.

@197 = ~Precisely. As I already mentioned, Gond Wonderbringer appeared on the shores of Lantan during the Time of Troubles. During those years Ao, the overfather of the Gods, decreed they must walk among us as mortals. Gond Wonderbringer chose to take the form of a gnome - a logical choice, given the obvious advantages of my race. It was in this form that he washed up on the shores of Lantan. As you can imagine people were skeptical of Gond's claim, but the Wonderbringer's clerics confirmed his identity.~ /*Precisely.

@204 = ~Really? You mean you have something more powerful than smokepowder?~
@205 = ~As I have already told you, we are a society of observers and thinkers. We have a tradition of isolating ourselves from the politics and events of Faerun. But Gond changed all that.

@206 = ~He would not say when this time was or what the circumstances would be of this momentus event. But when a god tells you to go forth into the rest of the world, you would be wise to listen.~
@207 = ~But Lantan is still a very closed and mysterious society.~
@208 = ~Given the analytical nature of our society you could not expect we would suddenly integrate ourselves with the rest of Faerun without careful study and research of what we were about to undertake.

But you have proven yourself to me many times over, and I am certain not even Gond himself would begrudge me for asking your assistance in this matter.*/
@217 = ~As you know, <CHARNAME>, I left Lantan on a journey of discovery. What you might not have known was that my journey is also a holy pilgrammage in the service of Gond Wonderbringer. I have been charged with a task.~

@223 = ~Obviously bringing back an entire dragon would be an impossible request, and the clerics would have been foolish to burden me with such a ridiculous task.

@226 = ~I realize the odds of defeating a dragon without spells or magical weapons are so minute as to be negligible. However,there may be another way to obtain the scale. Dragons occasionally come into conflict with other creatures - giants and other dragons, primarily. In battling these foes surely a dragon must be wounded - perhaps even killed.~ /*I realize the odds of defeating a dragon without spells or magical weapons are so minute as to be negligible. However,there may be another way to obtain the scale.*/
@227 = ~Logically we might expect to find a dragon scale that has been torn free or dislodged in one of these struggles. This is far more likely than killing a dragon ourselves without any magical aid whatsoever.~

@229 = ~You better not be thinking about going in search of a dragon cave. You still work for me, remember?~
@230 = ~Do not fear, <CHARNAME>. As long as you seek the Words of Power I shall remain in your service.
