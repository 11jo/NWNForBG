@0 = ~What do you want? Come on now, I've got time if you're quick.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I've the time, sure enough. What do you want to know?~
@4 = ~Know anything about the plague?~
@5 = ~Anything odd happening here?~
@6 = ~What locations are important in the Docks district?~
@7 = ~All right then. Farewell.~
@8 = ~No, and I don't care to. I ain't even thinking about it. Of course, I guess I showed up here... well, we're all here for strange reasons.~
@9 = ~Well, just look around you. Bloodsailors looking all rough, some auction thing taking too long, and damned if I have seen any Bloodsailor brass here all night.~
@10 = ~I want to ask about the Bloodsailors.~
@11 = ~I want to ask about the auction.~
@12 = ~I'd rather ask you about something else.~
@13 = ~NP: There aren't many places now. A lot of them have closed because of the pestilence. I suppose you can ask, but there's not much I can do to help you. There's also the Golden Apple and the Twenties-in-a-box. Just a couple of regular places, I think. I prefer to sit here at Sidi's Tavern.~ /*There's still the Golden Apple and the Twenty in a Quiver. A couple other places, I guess. I just stay here at the Seedy, myself.*/
@14 = ~Tell me about the Seedy Tavern.~
@15 = ~Tell me about the Golden Apple.~
@16 = ~Tell me about the Twenty in a Quiver.~
@17 = ~I'm looking for basic services. General stuff.~
@18 = ~Their business ain't my concern, especially their infighting... I really shouldn't say any more. I don't swim well, especially in a sack filled with rocks.~
@19 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@20 = ~NP: You're a Dwarf, like me. Why don't you just let it go?~ /*We both have <PRO_RACE> blood. Why not give me a break?*/
@21 = ~Come now, handsome. You can tell me, can't you?~
@22 = ~NP: No one seems to know what's going on here. Vengaul Bloodsail himself organized the whole thing, but he's late. It could all be canceled. They say there's a cure for the plague for sale. Rumors are spreading, and I think someone was afraid the guards would find out. I don't know how it happened. I think Vengaul wanted them to find out. He likes to show off. He takes risks all the time. Some of his men don't like it.~ /*I don't know how they didn't. It was like Vengaul wanted them to know. He's flashy. A risk taker. Some of his men don't like it.*/
@23 = ~Eh, if you make it quick.~
@24 = ~This place? This is where everything happens. It's where they usually set up the black market, but things are a little strange right now.~
@25 = ~What do you mean when you say "strange?"~
@26 = ~NP: "The Golden Apple? It's a nice little tavern. Not much going on in it though. sidi's tavern is where you have to go to see the buzz of life. "The Golden Apple is in the southern part of the neighborhood, if you're interested.~ /*The Golden Apple? A fine little tavern. Not much happens there, though. The Seedy Tavern is where you want to be for action.*/
@27 = ~NP: "Uh, this is the only place that works right now. There's a lot of this and that, and actually, most of the black market goods end up here. It's just east of Sidi's Tavern. In the northeast part of the neighborhood, I think.~ /*Eh, it's the only place that's doing any business now. Lots of this and that, though most of the black market stuff there ends up here.*/
@28 = ~NP: "Uh, you'll have to shop either here or at the Twenty-in-a-Cole. Most of the other places are closed due to the pestilence. You have to go to the Heart of the City if you want the temples and mage towers.~ /*Eh, you'll be stuck shopping here or the Twenty in a Quiver. Most other places are gone because of the plague.*/
@29 = ~NP: I suppose you're right. Perhaps they're too busy to worry about what I'm telling you here. "The Blood Sailors weren't always so abrasive, but that's all changed now. Kallik no longer lets Vengaul do as he pleases.~ /*The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.*/
@30 = ~Tell me about Vengaul.~
@31 = ~Tell me about Callik.~
@32 = ~Sorry, but I'm just not getting involved. Callik wants to challenge Vengaul, that's his business, not mine and not yours.~
@33 = ~NP: I suppose there's something I can tell you. Then I'll lay low for a while, if anything, to keep me out of trouble. "The Blood Sailors weren't always so abrupt, but that's all changed now. Kallik no longer lets Vengaul do as he pleases.~ /*The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.*/
@34 = ~NP: Well, I guess there's nothing wrong with talking to you. I can just lay low if there's a problem. "The Blood Sailors weren't always so abrupt, but that's all changed now. Kallick no longer lets Vengaul do things the way he wants.~ /*The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.*/
@35 = ~NP: Ah, everyone's favorite leader and founder of the Bloody Sailors. Well, not everybody's favorite anymore. So they say. You see, he likes to draw a lot of attention to himself. All his plans usually involve public attention. He's more concerned with image than profit. Some of his people don't like that very much. They say he has a problem with his officers. They want to be cooler, but attract less attention.~ /*Ah, the well-loved leader and founder of the Bloodsailors. Well, not so well-loved these days, I hear. See, he likes to show off.*/
@36 = ~Is that why he's not here tonight?~
@37 = ~NP: Callick... well, Cullick is not a very nice man. He cares more about gold than showing courage or style. He's good at taking money from his victims, but he's very hard to work for. If it weren't for Vengaul, he'd be even worse. Some Blood Sailors prefer to work for him, and things seem to be looking up for him to challenge Vengaul.~ /*He's very efficient getting gold out of his victims, but he's a hard man to work for. If not for Vengaul, he'd be even worse.*/
@38 = ~Does he have the backing to do that?~
@39 = ~NP: Oh, the Vengaul I know loves a fair fight. He never runs from danger. It seems something went wrong in what he was planning here. I'm telling you it's none of my business. But we saw some of Kallick's boys go downstairs, and now the basement's locked. Something's going on. But I don't know what.~ /*Oh, the Vengaul I know likes confrontation. He wouldn't run from a fight. I think whatever was supposed to happen up here has been changed.*/
@40 = ~NP: Kallick wields a considerable amount of power. Many Blood Sailors would rather earn more than play a free play. In fact, Kallick has taken over the black market. He's one of several guys that went down with the key. I had a feeling he'd be here. It's not his style to stay home if there's something going on somewhere. He really wants to step on Wengaul's toes.~ /*I thought he'd be here. Not like him to sit in his house while something is happening. He'd really like to embarrass Vengaul.*/
@41 = ~Where is his house?~
@42 = ~NP: Hmm? I think it's just east of the center of the neighborhood. But I wouldn't advise you to go there. Unless, of course, you're looking for trouble.~ /*Hmm? I think it was in the far northeast corner of the district. I wouldn't go poking around there, though. Not unless you want trouble.*/
@43 = ~Well met, friend. Fine night in the inn, eh. Right busy, it is.~
@44 = ~Go on, why are you bothering me? I've no interest in you.~
@45 = ~Ah, I got no reason to talk. No more auction, no more fighting. Nothing happening now, so you might as well leave me be.~
