@0 = ~Ah, yes, hello there. I am, eh, Hemmel Masterson. This is my wife Agnes, and our manservent Morden. I wonder, by chance, if you've seen a man named Callik? He has an amulet of mine and he, ah, seems to have forgotten us.~ /*I wonder, by chance, if you've seen a man named Callik? He has an amulet of mine and he, ah, seems to have forgotten us.*/
@1 = ~The glaring eyes of my wife wish to remind me that she did say the man was not to be trusted, but perhaps he is only delayed.~
@2 = ~Masterson? I believe I have an amulet of yours.~
@3 = ~What do you know about the docks?~
@4 = ~What seems to be the trouble?~
@5 = ~I've no time for this. Goodbye.~
@6 = ~I'm quite aware of what you said, my dear. Now, if you will just let me speak to this nice <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@7 = ~Wonderful! Snatched from fate and returned to family Masterson! You see, Agnes? We Mastersons get things done!~
@8 = ~Here you go. I am pleased to return it.~
@9 = ~I'd like a reward for returning it.~
@10 = ~Now, let's talk about adequate payment, fool.~
@11 = ~Actually, I think I'll keep it.~
@12 = ~Very little, I'm afraid. I came here... well... I came here hoping to circumvent the quarantine on Neverwinter. I arranged for transport that would leave from the docks. I traded an heirloom amulet to a man who swore he was honest.~ /*I arranged for transport that would leave from the docks. I traded an heirloom amulet to a man who swore he was honest.*/
@13 = ~Well, it's embarrassing. You see, we were led to believe that passage out of Neverwinter could be had here. We were fleeing the quarantine. I arranged for transport that would leave from the docks. I traded an heirloom amulet to a man who swore he was honest.~ /*I arranged for transport that would leave from the docks. I traded an heirloom amulet to a man who swore he was honest.*/
@14 = ~Eh, yes, very well. Goodbye. We'll just... wait here for mister Callik then. Yes. That's what we'll do.~
@15 = ~And I am happy to take it. Here, some gold for your trouble. You may even live to spend it. Now, I just have to get out of here. We can't break quarantine, but if we barricade the manor...~ /*And I am happy to take it. Here, some gold for your trouble. You may even live to spend it.*/
@16 = ~I suppose I could be convinced to pay a fair price. Here, take this 500 gold and something from the Masterson armory.~
@17 = ~That will be fine. Thank you.~
@18 = ~You must agree I am worth more?~
@19 = ~I want more. Don't make me angry.~
@20 = ~I... I can't do anything about that... I'm no fighter, as Agnes will attest. I can only ask that you reconsider. I will be here... I've nowhere else to go, really. I cannot even know if you really have it.~ /*I... I can't do anything about that... I'm no fighter, as Agnes will attest. I can only ask that you reconsider.*/
@21 = ~A strapping gent. Callik was his name. He said he was soon to come into his own ship.~
@22 = ~My wife may disagree with my appraisal of him, but he swore he would return.~
@23 = ~Who was this man?~
@24 = ~You paid with an amulet?~
@25 = ~I suppose I could look into it for you.~
@26 = ~I've no interest in helping you.~
@27 = ~My dear, do shut up.~
@28 = ~That is, if I can suffer the glares of my wife. As if losing the Masterson family amulet wasn't enough...~
@29 = ~Allow me to express my thanks, and my relief. Now, if you don't mind, we're off to barricade the manor.~
@30 = ~I am more that willing to agree that you are worth more but I really don't have much else with me.~
@31 = ~NP: Okay, lets have some.~ /*Ask me your riddle, then.*/
@32 = ~NP: Then Ill keep the amulet for myself.~ /*Then I am keeping him.*/
@33 = ~Please! There's no point! I don't have much. I don't carry a bank with me! I don't have much more!~
@34 = ~That amulet was a valuable heirloom. It was a high price, but for the safety of my loved ones, I decided not to quibble.~
@35 = ~I would be most appreciative if you could. Mr Callik does appear to be... taking an inordinate amount of time. He said he would ready a ship, but when he left he went inland. He did drop some sort of auction notice.~ /*I would be most appreciative if you could. Mr Callik does appear to be... taking an inordinate amount of time.*/
@36 = ~He said he would ready a ship, but when he left he went inland. He did drop some sort of auction notice.~
@37 = ~I mean, he seemed honest. It has only been... a day...~
@38 = ~The suspicions of my wife have alarmed me. I would like assurances that he is returning. The amulet is valuable to me, after all.~
@39 = ~How valuable is "valuable?"~
@40 = ~Nothing is proven, dear. Still, I would like assurances. It was a valuable amulet, after all. Passed down by my forefathers.~
@41 = ~You've probably got one already, knowing the area as you must. It doesn't do me much good... I'm a stranger here. Please, return my amulet if you find it. It will have the Masterson crest. I've given up on breaking quarantine; I just want back what's mine.~ /*Please, return my amulet if you find it. It will have the Masterson crest. I've given up on breaking quarantine; I just want back what's mine.*/
@42 = ~Here, you can have it. I'm not familiar with the area so it does me no good anyway. Please, return my amulet if you find it. It will have the Masterson crest. I've given up on breaking quarantine; I just want back what's mine.~ /*Please, return my amulet if you find it. It will have the Masterson crest. I've given up on breaking quarantine; I just want back what's mine.*/
@43 = ~Well, I should perhaps say that its value is primarily sentimental. It has been on our mantel for generations.~
@44 = ~Well, I suppose the thing has some other uses, but it's been years since a Masterson has stooped to dungeon delving.~
@45 = ~I wonder, by chance, if you've seen a man named Callik? He has an amulet of mine and he, ah, seems to have forgotten us.~
@46 = ~Hello again, . I hope you have good news for me? I've seen no sign of Callik or my amulet.~
@47 = ~I have your amulet here.~
@48 = ~I need you to repeat some things.~
@49 = ~I'll see what I can do.~
@50 = ~If you need, though I don't know if there's anything else I can add.~
@51 = ~Please, I hope you will reconsider. This Callik, he has taken advantage of me and I can't do anything about it except point you in his direction.~
