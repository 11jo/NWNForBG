@0 = ~Oh dear, I see the nymph has bewitched another one. Wait, you don't have the look of one beguiled by her sorcery.~
@1 = ~No, I'm not. I have control of my own mind. Who are you?~
@2 = ~I am not so foolish as to be captured by a nymph. You may leave now, thanks to me.~
@3 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@4 = ~NP: My name is Terari. I am a druid from the grove of Neverwinter Forest. And to whom do I have the honor?~ /*My name is Terari. I am a druid of the Neverwinter Wood grove. And who are you good <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/
@5 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Aawill sent me to find you.~
@6 = ~NP: I'm with the <CHARNAME> team. Aavil sent us to find you.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. Aawill sent me to find you.*/
@7 = ~Wait, before you go, did Aawill send you?~
@8 = ~He sent me to rescue some druids. Are you one of them?~
@9 = ~I have met someone named Aawill. How do you know him?~
@10 = ~I will try to wait patiently, though I do not wish to be locked in here again, so please make haste.~
@11 = ~Then I owe both Aawill and you a debt of honor. I only wish I had gotten further on my mission to save the Spirit of the Wood.~
@12 = ~How far did you get?~
@13 = ~"How did you end up here?"~
@14 = ~NP: Wise Aavil. He always takes care of everything. My name is Terari. I am a druid from the grove of Neverwinter Forest. And to whom do I have the honor?~ /*My name is Terari. I am a druid of the Neverwinter Wood grove. And who are you good <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/
@15 = ~NP: He is the head of our circle of druids. My name is Terari. I am a druid from the grove of Neverwinter Forest. And with whom do I have the honor?~ /*My name is Terari. I am a druid of the Neverwinter Wood grove. And who are you good <PRO_SIRMAAM>?*/
@16 = ~I didn't get very far. I thought that although the animals were not communicating, the nymphs might be a good source of information. They may be flighty, but I thought that they would have strong enough minds to resist the Spirit's madness.~
@17 = ~It is rather embarrassing actually. I thought the nymphs might be a good source of information, since they have stronger minds than your average woodland animal.~
@18 = ~I came to this house first, since I had... um... known this particular nymph in the past. She seemed very pleased to see me, eager even. I was hoping to get some information from her, without... well... going into her house.~
@19 = ~Why didn't you want to enter her house?~
@20 = ~You were suspicious already, weren't you?~
@21 = ~NP: Somewhere in the back of my mind, a part of me kept wondering why she never once called me by my name, even though we'd known each other for quite some time. It seemed, uh. strange. Unfortunately, I couldn't think coherently. I guess I was just sure she couldn't do anything I couldn't handle. When we entered her house, she motioned for me to undress, and while I did, she cast a spell on me.~ /*Unfortunately, I was not thinking clearly. I guess I was just certain that I could handle anything she tried. When we got into her house she suggested that I get undressed, and while I was doing that she cast a spell on me.*/
@22 = ~I guess she knew how to manipulate you.~
@23 = ~I guess I could see how that could happen.~
@24 = ~Being locked up is the least of what you deserved for such disgusting behavior.~
@25 = ~She did seem a bit more eager than normal to get me into her house.~
@26 = ~Next thing I knew, I was locked in here, unable to escape. The nymph hasn't harmed me, she just won't let me go. Before she enters the room she casts some kind of spell and I wake up later with no memories of what happened.~
@27 = ~You can judge my behavior when you have proven your own to be perfect.~
@28 = ~Now that you have freed me, I must return to the grove to discuss the Spirit of the Wood with the other druids. Maybe the others have learned more than I have.~
@29 = ~The Spirit is dead. I'm afraid I had to kill it.~
@30 = ~I have cured the Spirit of the Wood. You no longer need to worry about that problem.~
@31 = ~I'm trying to help with that. What have you learned about the Spirit of the Wood?~
@32 = ~The other druids never returned either. I don't suppose you know where they might be?~
@33 = ~Are you able to get out of here on your own now?~
@34 = ~That is horrible news. The forest will suffer for generations. I desperately hope that you tried everything possible before going to such lengths.~
@35 = ~I had no other choice. If I could have done it some other way, I would have.~
@36 = ~Well, there might have been another way, but this was the quickest.~
@37 = ~NP: You must be one of those heroes who are the stuff of legends. How did you manage to accomplish such a feat? No, don't tell me. I'm sure you have many more to accomplish in the future. When you are famous and all the bards are singing songs about your exploits, I hope you will return to this forest and enjoy its silence.~ /*You must be the kind of hero that legends are born of. How is it that you accomplished such a deed? No, don't tell me now, you have much more to do I'm sure.*/
@38 = ~NP: Surely everything possible has been done. I only hope the forest can survive this loss. I should get going. I'll make my own way. I'll meet you at the druid grove.~ /*I'm sure that you did your best. I just hope the woods survives this loss. I should get going now.*/
@39 = ~NP: Such cruelty to nature is a sign of a black soul. Believe me, your actions will come back to haunt you one day. Evil begets evil and its own destruction. I could say more, but I don't think you're interested in listening to me preach. I'll leave you in the hands of nature. I'll make my own way. Meet me in the druid grove.~ /*Evil begets evil and is its own downfall. I would say more, but I suppose you are hardly interested in a sermon from me. I will leave you in the hands of nature now.*/
@40 = ~NP: Maybe we can be friends and tell each other stories. Until that happens, I have to go. I'll get there myself. I'll meet you at the druid grove.~ /*Maybe then we can share stories and maybe become friends. Until then I must go.*/
@41 = ~NP: I don't know why, but the Spirit is definitely insane, and that insanity is infecting the Forest. It's even affected the nymphs, so he's got quite a grip. I know in order to get to the Spirit, you'll have to somehow enter the pond he used to enter and exit the Forest. Before casting the spell, the nymph mentioned that the Spirit hadn't shown up here in quite some time.~ /*I do know that in order to get to the Spirit you will have to find a way to enter the pool that it used to come through to get into and out of the Wood. Before she cast the spell, the nymph did mention that the Spirit hasn't been here in quite a while.*/
@42 = ~Tell me more about this pool.~
@43 = ~NP: Why doesn't the Spirit come?~ /*Why hasn't the Spirit come?*/
@44 = ~NP: I don't really know what the others were going to do, really, Orlane was heading southeast. As for Bree, she's so vain - it's hard to guess what will come into her head. I wish there was something else I could do to help you. I hope they found out more about the spirit than I did.~ /*I am unsure of what the others had planned, although Orlane was headed in a southeasterly direction. As for Bree, it's hard to divine her intentions, since her vanity masks them well.*/
@45 = ~NP: I can make it on my own. I'll meet you at the druid grove. Thank you again, and good luck.~ /*I can make it on my own. I will meet up with you at the druid grove.*/

@47 = ~The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.~
@48 = ~Why didn't you go into it?~
@49 = ~What do you mean another realm?~
@50 = ~She didn't say why, she just said that the Spirit hasn't come out of the pool in a while. Nymphs don't have a very good grasp of time.~
@51 = ~NP: No living thing can pass through a portal to another realm. So say the oldest legends of my people. The legends say that the portal connects the realities of the living and the dead. A spirit is a creature, in some ways, only half alive, so it can go here and there through the portal, but we cannot.~ /*The stories say that the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so she can go back and forth through the portal, but we can't.*/
@52 = ~Do you have any suggestions of what I should do?~
@53 = ~It's another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.~
@54 = ~NP: You should try to find the others and see if they have learned more. Besides, there's also a witch named Setara in the Forest, she might know something too. I was just about to talk to her after the nymphs. Other than that, I don't have any thoughts on how to help the Spirit, but it has to be done soon, before some daredevil adventurer decides to slaughter every living thing in the forest.~ /*You should try to find the others and see if they know any more. There is also a witch named Setara in the Wood, who might know something. I was going to talk to her after the nymphs.*/
@55 = ~As patient as the trees I wait upon your pleasure. Still, I should like to be going soon.~
@56 = ~Why don't you tell me your story?~
@57 = ~Thank you for your assistance. I would be grateful if you wouldn't spread the details of what happened to me around.~
