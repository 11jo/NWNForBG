@0 = ~Well fought! You have proven quite the force, defeating Callik like that. The lad was giving me trouble. No sense of style. Still, I gather from your well-fortified self that I am in further trouble, am I not?~ [NWVENG50] /*Well fought! You have proven quite the force, defeating Callik like that. The lad was giving me trouble. No sense of style.*/
@1 = ~I've come for the Cockatrice, Vengaul.~
@2 = ~You have something that doesn't belong to you.~
@3 = ~Your actions caused no end of chaos!~
@4 = ~Of course, of course. I expected as much, though I was also hoping that Nasher would make an appearance. I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.~ /*I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.*/
@5 = ~Now you'll hand it over for the good of everyone.~
@6 = ~I demand you give me the Waterdhavian creature! And your weapons!~
@7 = ~You'll be paying a high price this time. I can't let you live.~
@8 = ~I suppose from your perspective you are correct. Since you are the dominant force in the room, I bow to your wisdom. I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.~ /*I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.*/
@9 = ~Nonsense. I merely issued a statement or two. How people choose to react to that is not my concern. I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost. Imagine my surprise at seeing some dog in the street carrying it. I merely wished to put it to good use.~ /*I stumbled upon the remains of a fine little bird that Nasher and his lackeys carelessly lost.

@10 = ~Of course I will. Oh, don't look so surprised. What am I going to do with some mangy bird? Besides, I know full well how important the feathers of this beast are. My fun was in making Nasher want it. Since he won't play and my men have largely abandoned me, the ruse is over. The remains of the beast are in a crate. Take the feathers, and my blessings. I have friends suffering from the plague too, you know. Nasher knows who I mean.~ /*Of course I will. Oh, don't look so surprised. What am I going to do with some mangy bird? Besides, I know full well how important the feathers of this beast are.*/
@11 = ~Okay. You get going then.~
@12 = ~You've hurt too many people with this.~
@13 = ~NP: My weapon? You really run into conflict. Will you forgive me if I just leave? My lieutenants will be able to respond to your bloodthirstiness. May the strongest win the prize!~ /*You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!*/
@14 = ~That's a blanketing statement. Why, may I ask, do you deem it necessary to kill me?~
@15 = ~Just for a laugh, really.~
@16 = ~Sounds like Nasher would appreciate you being dead.~
@17 = ~Just trying to intimidate you a bit. No harm meant.~
@18 = ~As you will. Farewell, my friend. Our paths will cross again, I am sure.~
@19 = ~That wasn't my doing. Desperate people do desperate things. Would you kill the baker if they rioted over bread? You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!~ /*You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!*/
@20 = ~"Just for a laugh" then, I'll do my best to escape. I've no reason to die here. Not when I would've returned the beast anyway. The remains of the creature are in a crate. Send it to Nasher with my regards, though I doubt he'll have time for a scoundrel like you.~ /*The remains of the creature are in a crate. Send it to Nasher with my regards, though I doubt he'll have time for a scoundrel like you.*/
@21 = ~You don't know the old boy like I do. We've been at each other's throats for years. He'd not want me caged or dead. This whole thing would have been an insult, to be sure, but deep inside, Nasher likes these little confrontations You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!~ /*You'll pardon me if I just leave? My lieutenants will more than oblige your bloodlust. The spoils of victory to the winners!*/
@22 = ~Well, a great deal of harm was taken. I'll just take my leave. You'll find what you need in my absence, I am sure.~
