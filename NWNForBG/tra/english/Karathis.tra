@0 = ~You have come to put down the dread Sir Karathis, have you?~ [KARAT053]
@1 = ~I've come to talk, nothing more.~
@2 = ~You failed the boys of Port Llast. Prepare to die.~
@3 = ~Neurik gave me these silver charms. I think I can help...~
@4 = ~Stay here, Sir Karathis. Perhaps I can help you yet.~
@5 = ~What do you want?!~
@6 = ~Can you tell me what happened?~
@7 = ~Help me fake your death and you can go free.~
@8 = ~If you come here out of honor, then let us fight with honor, for that I have not lost...~
@9 = ~You come to me with silver? Do you not remember that I was a werewolf hunter? That silver would be poison to me now.~
@10 = ~This is magic, representative of Tyr's justice.~
@11 = ~If it was normal silver, perhaps, but this bears Neurik's holy blessing.~
@12 = ~I offer you a choice, Karathis - Take it or I kill you.~
@13 = ~Enough about cures and poisons, then - let us fight as warriors!~
@14 = ~With what? An army or a cure?~
@15 = ~And would you believe me when I told the truth? Don't mark me for a fool.~
@16 = ~Seriously - I don't know what happened.~
@17 = ~A deceiver made me what I am today! I may look like the Black Wolf, but I shan't become like him! Take your offers elsewhere.~
@18 = ~Justice, you say? If it slays the wicked and cures the righteous, then I shall gladly use this charm. I know my heart!~
@19 = ~Holy-charmed silver, is it? If it slays the wicked and cures the righteous, than I shall use this charm. I know my heart!~
@20 = ~Then I shall use your filthy charm. I am a servant of my god, however, and it is by his hand that I shall make miracles of your base attempts!~
@21 = ~NP: Though my mind rebels against it, but my heart knows best - you speak... reasonably. Is it so? Fine. I will tell this sad story. Much of my career as an adventurer has been devoted to hunting werewolves - in fact, I've been knighted as a result of this duty I've taken on. But I had to face the greatest challenge of my life, the Black Wolf. I brought four young men from Port Llast Harbor to help meâ€”Urth, Bran, Geth, and Ender.~ /*But I was to face my greatest challenge with the Black Wolf. I brought four young men of Port Llast - Urth, Bran, Geth, and Ander - to help me.*/
@22 = ~But with tragic irony, I was afflicted with lycanthropy, and I cursed them to the same in turn, all save the youngest, Ander. It has been a dark day ever since.~
@23 = ~Do you know the identity of the Black Wolf?~
@24 = ~I believe that I do, but I would keep that secret as my own - perhaps I might use it as a key to restore my humanity.~
@25 = ~I have regained control. You need no longer attack me!~ [KARAT052]
@26 = ~NP: Now, that should be proof enough of my innocence. Take this diary I wrote and give it to Newrick. He tells the truth about what happened. Now, if you will, I must return to my order to suffer my own punishment for taking the form of my enemy. Read my diary with due care and act accordingly.~ /*Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to my order and seek penance for taking on the shape of my enemy. Read my journal well and act upon it.*/
@27 = ~It appears that Sir Karathis Ironheart is not the Black Wolf after all. He entered the caves east of the Green Griffon Inn and was ambushed and infected himself. Maddened with the bloodlust of his unexpected transformation, he lashed out at the boys who had joined him in the hunt but luckily was able to refrain from killing them outright. Neurik, the Tyrist priest back in Port Llast will be chagrined to learn that, even with the situation of Sir Karathis addressed, the dreaded Black Wolf remains on the loose. Worse yet, Sir Karathis has given him a familiar name: Alhelor, the merchant selling anti-lycanthropic supplies at Ander's side in Port Llast's Alliance Arms Inn. The boy's life is in great danger and it is imperative that this news be reported to Neurik at once.~
@28 = ~Grrr - Please! - Grrrrr - Can't control... Myself!~ [KARAT051]
@29 = ~NP: Prepare for death.~ /*Now you die!*/
@30 = ~NP: Port Llast: Werewolf hunter Newrick, priest of Tyr from the temple in Port Llast, tells of a terrible tragedy that befell several young residents of the city. Sir Caratis Ironheart, an itinerant werewolf hunter, has asked four boys to help him hunt down the dreaded lycanthrope known as the Black Wolf. But it was a trap, and Sir Caratis turned out to be the Black Wolf himself. His claws tore through the flesh of Bran, Urth and Geth, infecting them with a terrible disease, and only the youngest boy, Ender, managed to escape. Newrick believes that the three youths can still be cured of a terrible disease with the help of talismans made by him.~ /*Neurik, a priest of Tyr who presides of Port Llast's temple, warns of a terrible tragedy that has befallen some of the town's young men. Sir Karathis Ironheart, a travelling werewolf hunter, enlisted the help of four boys to hunt a foul lycanthrope known only as the Black Wolf. It was a trap, however, and Sir Karathis was himself the Black Wolf. His claws raked the flesh of Bran, Urth, and Geth, infecting them with his dread disease, leaving only the youngest boy, Ander, to escape. Neurik believes that, if found soon enough, the three young men may still be curable by a potion he has concocted. Ander currently spends his days at the Alliance Arms Inn, trying to spread news amongst adventurers of the tragedy that befell his friends. Neurik recommends speaking with the boy to gain an understanding of where those friends may now be hiding.*/
