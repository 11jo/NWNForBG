@0 = ~MT: You have shown yourself to be a completely immoral person. How lucky I am to leave.~ /*You sound so confident. I wish I could say the same.*/
@1 = ~MT: Oh my friend, is it true? But I can't give you back the money. Are you sure you want us to break up?~ /*Oh, my friend, is this true? I can't give you your money back. Are you you sure this is what you want?*/
@2 = ~Yes. Go.~
@3 = ~No. Stay.~
@4 = ~MT: Then I should wait for you until you need me again. Please don't go too long. Be careful<CHARNAME> . Where can we meet if you change your mind?~ /*Then I shall wait here until you have further need of me again. Please don't be long. Take care, dear <CHARNAME>.*/
@5 = ~MT: Go back to the sword fair.~ /*Get to the point.*/
@6 = ~MT: I'll find you at Kendrak Barracks.~ /*Port Llast - Kendrack's Barracks*/
@7 = ~MT: Wait for me here.~ /*Wait right here.*/
@8 = ~I hoped that you would return, so I waited here. I've hardly damaged anything since you left; I thought you'd be proud. May I join with you once more, my friend?~ [LINA060]
@9 = ~Yep.~
@10 = ~No.~
@11 = ~I shall try to breathe life back into you and your quest.~
@12 = ~(Sigh) Then I shall wait here for you to return.~
@13 = ~<CHARNAME>! I had hoped that you would show up here, my friend. I heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the evil cult that was responsible for the plague.~ [LINA053]
@14 = ~Linu, what a pleasant surprise.~
@15 = ~I thought we parted ways. Why have you followed me?~
@16 = ~Goodbye.~
@17 = ~MT: I thought that we were separated for good, but the goddess has her own plans, which I must follow. I returned to the Sword Fair to prepare for my journey home. I had only been there for a few hours when Lady Aribeth approached me on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ /*I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.*/
@18 = ~MT: You certainly know how to flatter yourself, but I won't join you. I have my own reasons and goals for being here. I returned to the Sword Fair to prepare for my journey home. I had only been there for a few hours when Lady Aribeth approached me on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ /*I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.*/
@19 = ~If you find yourself spending a lot of time with the temple healers, you might want to come back here and hire me. Good luck.~
@20 = ~MT: She told me that Lord Nasher was determined to find out the whereabouts of the cult that had brought so much suffering to the city. He ordered all the mercenaries to come to Port Llast and join the search. I was afraid that you and I missed each other when I was changing.~ /*She told me that Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search.*/
@21 = ~Changing your clothes?~
@22 = ~I want you to join me again.~
@23 = ~MT: Oh, as soon as I arrived at the local tavern, the waitress spilled some drinks.~ /*Oh, when I came in here a waitress spilled some drinks.*/
@24 = ~She soaked your clothes?~
@25 = ~Did you get mad at her?~
@26 = ~MT: Oh, I'm so excited to have the chance to go on another hike with you. I will follow you and do my best in obedience to the order you have given.~ /*Oh, <CHARNAME>, I'm so excited to be on another adventure with you.*/
@27 = ~Well... no. I bumped into her and when the drinks crashed down I leapt backwards into a dwarf, knocking over his ale and stew.~
@28 = ~So that messed you up?~
@29 = ~I think I'm getting the picture.~
@30 = ~Um, no, the food and drinks landed on the floor, but the dwarf crashed into a half-orc, causing the knife he was eating with to slice open his cheek. That's when the brawl started.~
@31 = ~And you wrecked your outfit in the brawl?~
@32 = ~Disaster follows you, doesn't it?~
@33 = ~I managed to stay out of the brawl, hiding under a table and feeling awfully guilty. When the fight was over I felt I should help clean up the mess.~
@34 = ~So you got dirty cleaning up?~
@35 = ~Please tell me that's how you got dirty.~
@36 = ~No, I wore an apron and managed to stay pretty clean. Then I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air and slipped in a mud puddle. So then I had to go change.~
@37 = ~Why didn't you just tell me you slipped in a puddle from the start?~
@38 = ~I think I'll go somewhere else now. Maybe to a nice safe dragon lair.~
@39 = ~MT: I... I didn't mean to give the impression that I was clumsy. I'm waiting here for Lady Aribeth's orders.~ /*I... I didn't want you to think I was clumsy.*/
@40 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@41 = ~I often am in need of a skilled healer. Join me.~
@42 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@43 = ~Oh, please don't leave now. I didn't want to frighten you away.~
@44 = ~Lord Nasher ordered all mercenaries to come to Port Llast to help discover the whereabouts of the cult that nearly destroyed his city.~
@45 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@46 = ~If you want to bring them to justice, why are you waiting in here?~
@47 = ~MT: With my great pleasure. I look forward to our joint adventures. I will follow you and do my best in obedience to the order you have given.~ /*It would be a great pleasure, <CHARNAME>. I look forward to our adventures together.*/
@48 = ~MT: I haven't heard much about this cult, but I've heard a rumor that there's been some turmoil in Neverwinter Forest. I don't know much, but it seems that a ranger has appeared in the city, who says that in this forest, animals have begun to ferociously attack anyone who enters the thicket or even travels near the forest.~ /*I don't know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.*/
@49 = ~MT: I'm actually not that much of an investigator. I have been ordered to travel with those in need of a healer. This is how you solve riddles. Though I'd love to help you. I have a great ability in the art of healing, and besides, I can hold my own in combat. I will be a valuable companion on your journey.~ /*I have strong abilities in the art of healing, and I also can stand on my own in a fight. I would be a valuable resource for your quest.*/
@50 = ~Having failed to destroy us with their terrible disease, it would hardly shock me to find out that the cult had struck with a plague of vicious animals. Is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~
@51 = ~Are you planning to travel there?~
@52 = ~Why are you waiting around in here? Should you be investigating the problem?~
@53 = ~MT: Hello again,<CHARNAME> . I hope you remember me. I am Linu La'neral, cleric of Sehanine Moonbow. I'm just waiting for someone I can help bring these plague-spreaders to justice.~ [LINA055] /*I'm just waiting here so I can help someone bring those evil plague spreaders to justice.*/
