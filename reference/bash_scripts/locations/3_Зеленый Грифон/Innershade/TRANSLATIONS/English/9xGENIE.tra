@0    = ~Oh, I see we have some new so-called 'deviants' in the maze. If you are not insane, then this place will make a madman out of you sooner or later. However, if you are here, maybe I can make use of you. Tell me, are you interested in helping me in my research?~
@1    = ~I didn't expect to find anything less interesting in this place. Ok, tell me the details. You've got me interested.~
@2    = ~Get lost. I won't fall into another trap. Get of my way or be killed.~
@3    = ~Well, I have always been interested by what you call sanity, conscience, and free will. Isn't it a fascinating subject?~
@4    = ~Well, here is the deal: go north from here, just south of the book of summoning. You will find someone. Do not even try to talk with that creature. Just kill it. If you decide to talk with it, that will mean you have failed my test. Pass the test, and you will be given one wish...and I shall grant it.~
@5    = ~Tempting, isn't it? So... do you wish to help?~
@6    = ~Of course I will!~
@7    = ~No. Now get lost.~
@8    = ~Interesting answer. Well, that told me something more about your kind, and what's more, I do not have to grant any wishes. Interesting.~
@9    = ~Ah, exactly the answer I expected. Go now. I will wait here for your great return. I just cannot wait to see whether you are strong enough to slay the creature!~
@10   = ~So? Is the task completed?~
@11   = ~Yes. The boy is dead. Grant me my wish.~
@12   = ~I couldn't kill the boy! He's still a child! Get of my way. I won't be a part of your sick game!~
@13   = ~No. I have to go.~
@14   = ~So, you did it. Hmm... Interesting. As I thought, you do obey commands... even those are of inhuman cruelty. I see.~
@15   = ~You completed my task; however, you acted like monsters, and have probably lost part of your sanity. Now, I will decide what kind of prize you are worth. You are greedy, full of wrath... you will gain gold. Here, take it. Did you really think that I would grant your every wish? I grant those that suit the person.~
@16   = ~Farewell.~
@17   = ~Really?~
@18   = ~You have passed your test, then. Most interesting result. You should know that I lied to you. I do not grant wishes, as the old tales say. Instead, I give something that suits the person. Let me check what suits you, <PRO_RACE>.~
@19   = ~(You feel dazzled. You feel the genie's energy running through your body. Suddenly, everything stops, and the genie looks at you with an expression of interest on his face.)~
@20   = ~I see. She died. I can give you a little something that will help you on your way out of this place, but after I saw your past, I can do something more... but it will require a sacrifice from you. I will take part of your life. In exchange, I will resurrect your friend, Barbara. She will be given another chance to live. What is your decision?~
@21   = ~Resurrect Barbara, please.~
@22   = ~Give me something that will help me in my escape.~
@23   = ~An even more interesting result of my research! Your wish is granted!~
@24   = ~As you wish. Take it. It's time for me to leave! Farewell, adventurer!~
