@0 = ~NP: Nice to meet you. Sit quietly with me, will you? Its so noisy down there.~ /*Greetings and well met. Come to sit a bit in the heat, have you? Good for the skin.*/
@1 = ~Can I ask questions about who you are?~
@2 = ~Could I ask you something about this tavern?~
@3 = ~I'm going now.~
@4 = ~Oh, by all means. I'd like that.~
@5 = ~Who are you?~
@6 = ~What do you do around here?~
@7 = ~I suppose. I spend most of my time here, now. Waiting out the plague, you see. Could be in worse places, I wager.~
@8 = ~Do you know what is planned for downstairs?~
@9 = ~Have you noticed anything odd around here?~
@10 = ~A shame. I hope the <DAYNIGHT> treats you well. Come back anytime.~
@11 = ~NP: My name is Ulfnog. This name no doubt cuts your ear, but I like it. It suits me just fine. I am a traveller. Unfortunately, the plague caught me in Neverwinter. I havent left this inn for several weeks now.~ /*I am a traveler. Unfortunately I happened to be in Neverwinter when the plague began. I haven't stepped outside this inn for weeks.*/
@12 = ~NP: Enjoy the silence like I said. Its very nice here when the door is closed. She closes the world from us. I dont really like all this fuss downstairs. These &quot;Bloody Sailors&quot; have become too serious for some time now. Before ... well, okay, whats the balabolit.~ /*I don't much like the bustle downstairs. Them Bloodsailors are far too serious these days. They used to be... well, I'm droning on.*/
@13 = ~What was that about the Bloodsailors?~
@14 = ~Hmm? Some fool auction, I think. I even heard there was some part of a cure on the block. Doesn't make sense, though...~
@15 = ~Why?~
@16 = ~NP: Strange or unusual? Well, these &quot;Bloody Sailors&quot; have an unhealthy attachment to their ale. And mind you, not good gnome ale, but perverted explosive mixtures. I advise you to stay away from this Jalek. He prefers toughness, and I mean toughness.~ /*Odd or strange? Well, them Bloodsailors have an unwholesome attachment to their ale. Not good dwarven ale, mind you, but foul and perverse mixings.*/
@17 = ~Back to the inn... anything strange?~
@18 = ~NP: Well, it was just more fun with them before. They had these mindless antics that kept you constantly on your toes. I only know that the plague has something to do with it. But its not only that. There is a sense that their leaders are leading them in a new direction. Ah, its just that Ive had too much time to think since Ive been stuck here, hiding from the pestilence. What difference does it make to me what kind of analysis they have there?~ /*Ah, I've just had too much time to dwell on it, stuck here hiding from the plague. What do I care how uptight they get?*/
@19 = ~NP: Well, why is there an auction here? Something like this would be very expensive. Who needs petty crooks with their coppers? I mean, if youre waiting for a real buyer, the only reason to hold an auction here is to get all the people together so they know whos buying this thing. It seems to me that someone tried to put on a performance, and now this performance has been canceled.~ /*I mean, if you expect a big bidder, the only reason to have the auction here is to have all the people see who that bidder is.*/
@20 = ~The auction won't go ahead?~
@21 = ~NP: Changes... upheavals... Everything has been turned upside down for the Bloody Sailors. Some of them are now in the basement, others are not. Its like they split up. There seems to be a change in power. Vengaul hasnt been seen in a long time and... well, something suspicious is going on in the basement.~ /*Changes... shakeups... the Bloodsailors are upside-down. Some are allowed in the basement now, and some aren't. Almost like they've split in two.*/
@22 = ~How do I get down there?~
@23 = ~Don't think so. Vengaul Bloodsail himself was supposedly behind it, and he's late. Very late... and there's some other odd things...~
@24 = ~NP: Are they still making that poor cook guard the door? It probably pisses him off that his buffet is locked up, as much as it pisses me off. I overheard the password needed to get past him. But you still need a key or some proper lockpick. They dont even let him open the door himself.~ /*I overheard the password to get by him. You'll still need a key or some stout picks, though. They don't even let him open the door himself.*/
@25 = ~The password is "Cornerstone." At least it ain't some maryweather pompous nickname or somebody's dog. I hate it when thugs get cute like that.~
@26 = ~Thanks. Er, how did you know all of this?~
@27 = ~You can learn a lot in a small dark room. Don't let anyone tell you different.~
@28 = ~NP: Hello again. Was it the unimaginable uproar downstairs that made you come back?~ /*Hello, again. Have you managed to kill the imp and close the portal?*/
@29 = ~NP: Not much is going on in the tavern now, after all the intrigue among the Bloody Sailors is over. Good and quiet.~ /*Not a lot happening in the tavern now, what with the shakeup in the Bloodsailors over. Nice and quiet in the dark.*/
