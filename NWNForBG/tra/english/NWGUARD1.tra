@0 = ~Can I help you? I cannot be away from my duty for long. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they're replacing the ones we've lost...~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Hmm, the more information you have, the less risk you'll pose to the rest of us on duty. I'll help if I can.~
@4 = ~You know anything about the bad plague?~
@5 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@6 = ~Stay alive out there, recruit.~
@7 = ~I know what I'm told. Aribeth and her lot handle all the delicate stuff. We common guards keep the peace where we can and maintain the quarantine at all costs.~
@8 = ~You sound like you don't particularly like Aribeth.~
@9 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@10 = ~NP: All I hear is that things are getting worse and we're losing more and more people. It's like a war, except Howlin' Death won't give up. When we're gone, there'll be intrigue in every county, that's for sure. All I know is that we don't stand a chance, even here in the center...~ /*With us gone, the different districts each hold their intrigues, I'm sure. All I know is that we're fighting a losing battle, even here in the Core...*/
@11 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@12 = ~NP: She generally keeps the city safe and reports to Lord Nasher. She brings in your kind for special missions, and all we have to do is keep an eye on the looters who have lost their minds to the plague. I'm sorry, but I don't think she's more important than all those already taken by the Howling Death!~ /*She handles city security on a big scale, reporting to Lord Nasher. She brings in people like you for special missions, leaving us for little things like, oh, restraining plague-maddened rioters.*/
@13 = ~NP: Nothing. I once heard of Waterdeep creatures, but it's been a long time since then. My business is to guard the streets from rebels and marauders. I know those damned Helmites keep getting in our way. I swear their blessings don't do half of what they say.~ /*Not a thing. I was briefed on the Waterdhavian creatures, but nothing since. My life's on the line to keep the streets clear of rioters and looters.*/
@14 = ~What were you told about the Waterdhavian creatues?~
@15 = ~NP: The caravan that was carrying them was attacked as it entered the city. No one knows what happened to them afterward - probably scattered to the wind. They tried to find a cure, but then everything stalled. They wouldn't tell me the details. They just told me to keep an eye out to see if they showed up anywhere.~ /*The cure attempt they were for is still up in the air, I guess. They don't tell me about details. They just said keep an eye out for them.*/
