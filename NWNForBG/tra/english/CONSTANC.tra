@0 = ~Look, I have a lot of work to do, so please leave me be.~
@1 = ~Well... a handsome stranger in the bedroom of the farmer's daughter. I wonder where such an encounter could lead?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~I want to speak with you about Erik's brooch.~
@4 = ~What do you mean?~
@5 = ~Are you always this forward?~
@6 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@7 = ~Goodbye.~
@8 = ~He told you about that, huh? Well, I tried to get him to leave me alone but he persisted. I told him there was never going to be a relationship between us, but he wouldn't listen.~
@9 = ~I was going to give it back to him, if he promised to leave me alone, but now I need it. The gold I can get for selling it might help pa replace the cows killed by the wolves.~
@10 = ~Be reasonable. Ingo treasures that brooch, because it reminds him of his wife.~
@11 = ~How'd you like me to pry it from your cold, dead hands?~
@12 = ~MT: What is this, a joke? I already gave it away, don't you remember? Now, if there's anything else I can help you with...~ /*What is this, a joke? I already gave it to you, don't you remember?*/
@13 = ~Look, are we going to go over this again? I already told you this before, but I guess I have to repeat myself.~
@14 = ~Surely you know the story of the farmer's daughter and... oh, nevermind. Why must I always be surrounded by simpletons?~
@15 = ~I'm not simple, I was meerly trying to give you a chance to act more like a proper, young lady.~
@16 = ~Oh, that! Well, you are rather cute...~
@17 = ~Oh... I'm sorry. I shouldn't act that way. It's just that being one of the only young people for miles around... well, it gets so dull.~
@18 = ~Well, you are rather pretty...~
@19 = ~Fare you well, then. Perhaps we'll speak again.~
@20 = ~That may be so but it will also fetch a fine price in Port Llast - enough to by a couple head of cattle to replace those killed by the wolves, of late...~
@21 = ~Money? That's all this means to you?~
@22 = ~All right, tell me a little about Erik.~
@23 = ~For but a peasant's brooch, you'll have my undying love.~
@24 = ~MT: Yes, but what is this? Eric may want his brooch back, but I know for a fact that he wouldn't send anyone to kill me! Look, if that stupid old brooch means that much, we could make a deal. 1000 gold and she's yours, deal?~ /*Whoa, where did that come from? Erik may want his brooch back but I know for a fact that he wouldn't have sent someone to kill me!*/
@25 = ~1000 gold? Deal.~
@26 = ~It's a simple peasant's brooch, worth 250 at most!~
@27 = ~I can't afford to spend that much gold on this.~
@28 = ~MT: Give me the brooch, or I'll gut you like a fish!~ /*Hand the brooch over or I'll gut you like a fish!*/
@29 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
@30 = ~I'm investigating some recent events you might be aware of.~
@31 = ~Anything interesting going on in these parts?~
@32 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@33 = ~Oh... how embarassing. Sorry about that. So how can I help you?~
@34 = ~Forget it. The mood is gone now. What did you want?~
@35 = ~Yes, yes. On your way.~
@36 = ~Look, my ma and his ma were best friends before she passed on! If she would have known we were struggling, she'd have been happy to give it!~
@37 = ~Maybe I can buy it off you...~
@38 = ~Hand the brooch over or I'll gut you like a fish!~
@39 = ~MT: &quot;He is a good guy&quot;. That's what my mom says, and it's not that I don't agree... But if he really was a good guy, he would help my father more and spend less time picking bunches of wildflowers. That's all I want to say.~ /*But if he was a really nice boy, he'd spend more time helping out my pa and less time picking wildflowers, and that's all there is to it.*/
@40 = ~He loves you Constance. Don't betray that.~
@41 = ~All the love in the world won't buy a head of cattle... but you sure are a sweet talker, but I'm the one who used that trick on Erik, remember?~
@42 = ~MT: 1000 gold? We... We can buy the other half of the herd! Thank you, you have no idea how much this means to my family! Give me a sec. The brooch is in my pocket... Here it is, and hopefully this stupid Eric will learn not to give his heart away so easily. Now, is there anything else you need?~ /*1,000 gold? We... We could buy another half herd with this! Thank you so much, you can't know how much this means to my family!*/
@43 = ~MT: *sigh* Bargaining with Eric would be a lot easier, I tell you. Okay, let's make it 250...Give me a second. The brooch is in my pocket... Here it is, and hopefully this stupid Eric will learn not to give his heart away so easily. Now, is there anything else you need?~ /*Here it is and I hope that fool Erik has learned not to give his heart so freely. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?*/
@44 = ~MT: Well, I'm afraid you're out of luck. That's a very reasonable price to pay for the memory of a mother, isn't it? Come back when you're rich.~ /*Well, then I guess you're out of luck. 1,000 gold seems a perfectly reasonable price for memories of one's mother, wouldn't you agree?*/
@45 = ~Hey, hey, hey! Let's settle down. I'm sure Erik didn't send you to kill me! Look, I'll go as low as 250 then but no more threats from you...~
@46 = ~250? Deal.~
@47 = ~I'm done haggling. Time to kill you and take it for free!~
@48 = ~MT: What are you even asking about?~ /*... Why do you ask?*/
@49 = ~Do you know anything about the cult that spread plague in Neverwinter?~
@50 = ~Have you ever been to Charwood?~
@51 = ~MT: To the south of your farm, there is some kind of cave. Do you know anything about her?~ /*I saw a cave up past those waterfalls. Do you know anything about it?*/
@52 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@53 = ~Well there's always some sort of adventure to be had when you're this far from the rest of the world.~
@54 = ~Adventures? What adventures you speak of?~
@55 = ~I'd be interested in work, if you know of anything.~
@56 = ~Are there any places of interest around here that I should visit?~
@57 = ~Where do you need to go?~
@58 = ~MT: Where does the north road lead?~ /*Where does the west road lead?*/
@59 = ~Where does the east road lead?~
@60 = ~MT: Where does the south road lead?~ /*Where does the west road lead?*/
@61 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@62 = ~Really? Okay - You may have it for... 1,000 gold!~
@63 = ~Why so much money?~
@64 = ~Well he's a fool to do so - All the love in the world won't buy a head of cattle! *Sigh* But I know you're right...~
@65 = ~Look, 250 gold would buy us a healthy bull, let us rebuild the herd. If you have any pity in you, you'll give at least that. Please?~
@66 = ~Why is the herd so important?~
@67 = ~Me pa's a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we've got nothing. There wouldn't even be food on the table...~
@68 = ~MT: Give me a sec. The brooch is in my pocket... Here it is, and hopefully this stupid Eric will learn not to give his heart away so easily. Now, is there anything else you need?~ /*Here it is and I hope that fool Erik has learned not to give his heart so freely. Now, is there anything else I can do for you?*/
@69 = ~No! Someone help me, please!~
@70 = ~Okay, maybe I couldn't get 1,000 for it but I sure could get 400!~
@71 = ~400 gold? Deal.~
@72 = ~On our last trip to Port Llast, I heard a woman telling how awful the plague had been. Don't know much about the cult but they sound horrible.~
@73 = ~You're sure you don't know anything else about the cult?~
@74 = ~No. My pa won't let me. He says it's because they're strange, though he won't say why. I think it's because he doesn't want me meeting a boy and running off with him.~
@75 = ~Is there anything else you can tell me about Charwood?~
@76 = ~MT: Oh, this is the lair of those vile wolves! This season they have already slaughtered two cows. You can ask my dad about it if you're really interested. He's been following them like a hawk lately! Would you like to know something else?~ /*They've killed two cows already this season. You can ask me pa about it if you're really interested - he's been watching them like a hawk!*/
@77 = ~You could help my pa out. I don't know if you would consider that interesting or not.~
@78 = ~What does he need help with? Not plowing the fields, I assume.~
@79 = ~MT: Nothing like that, it's just that he's been having a lot of problems with wolves lately. You should go and talk to him. Most likely, he is doing some housework somewhere on the street. Would you like to know something else?~ /*You should go talk to him about it. He's probably somewhere outside doing chores.*/
@80 = ~MT: I don't know what might interest you. This is our farm, and over there Eric works with his dad. And there is nothing else here. Would you like to know something else?~ /*I'm not sure what you would find interesting. There's our farm and then the one Erik works with his pa. Not much more than that.*/
@81 = ~MT: Go all straight and straight along it, and you will reach Port Llast. On market days we travel along this road. And even further - Luskan.~ /*Follow it long enough and you'll make it all the way to Port Llast. That's the route we take on market day.*/
@82 = ~Nowhere really. Just into Charwood and I haven't seen anyone head that way in years. It's funny how the road never seems to grow over, though.~
@83 = ~MT: This is the road to Neverwinter. But it is very far away, I have never been there.~ /*You're right - Neverwinter brought this upon itself.*/
@84 = ~Around here? Don't hold your breath. If we can't grow it or make it ourselves, we have to trek all the way into Port Llast to find it.~
@85 = ~MT: My dad is a cattle breeder. And a very good breeder. But without a good herd we are nothing. We won't even have anything to eat... These stupid wolves will bring us to death, although they do not hunt us, but cattle!~ /*Me pa's a cattle rancher and a good one, too. Without a proper herd, though, we've got nothing. There wouldn't even be food on the table...*/
@86 = ~Don't think I enjoyed doing this to poor Erik - I like him, honest. But sometimes things get desperate, all right? I need the 1,000 gold.~
@87 = ~Look, 250 gold would buy us a healthy bull, let us rebuild the herd. If you have any pity in you, you'll give at least that. Please?~
@88 = ~MT: Take 250. The next idiot Eric sends to you might not negotiate with you at all.~ /*[Insight] Take the 250. The next fool Erik sends might not be so happy to negotiate.*/
@89 = ~MT: We are pretty isolated here. The girl is ready for almost anything to diversify her life a little. But only news about the weather, about a new calf, or about a good harvest reaches here. Do you need anything else?~ /*It gets pretty isolated out here. A girl will do just about anything for a bit of excitement, but any news there is is usually about the weather, a new calf, or a good harvest.*/
@90 = ~MT: Well, when Eric and I were kids, we used to tell each other that this forest is cursed. Just children's fairy tales, absolutely harmless. Do you have any more questions?~ /*Well, just that as kids, me and Erik used to tell each other the woods were haunted. Just children's stories, though - little harm can come of them.*/
@91 = ~I'm Constance O'Deel, the prettiest girl for miles around... Also the *only* girl for miles around, but that's another story. What can I do for you?~
@92 = ~Did Ma let you in here? This is a bedroom, not a bar table, I'll have you know.~
@93 = ~Back again, are you?~
