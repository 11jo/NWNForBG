@0 = ~Callers for the master don't arrive like this! Your finery is betrayed! Are you bandit?!~
@1 = ~I am no concern of yours. Walk away.~ 
@2 = ~Shut your mouth and be quiet or I kill you!~
@3 = ~Relax, I won't hurt you.~
@4 = ~Save your words. You'll get nothing from me. If you are looking for Master Hodge, he's already gone. You'd think the bugger knew someone was coming.~
@5 = ~Go 'way.~
@6 = ~Oh no, you aren't going to try those excuses on me. I gave a warning once, and now I'm through! GUARDS!~
@7 = ~Vermin in my kitchen. What mangey dog choked you up? Hmm? Bandit! Thief!~
