@0 = ~Don't worry about me! Just kill that fool Drawl! Get him!~ [NWWALT52]
@1 = ~NP: Hes dead... I know it... Drol is finally dead. Serve him. He took all my old friends with him... the Sword Coast Boys... all dead. Thank you for getting rid of Drol. He kept me here for several days. Probably for show. My name is Walters.~ [NWWALT55] /*He's gone... I know it... Drawl is finally gone. Good riddance. He brought all my old friends down with him... The Sword Coast Boys... all dead.*/
@2 = ~You're dressed like a city guard. Why were you captured?~
@3 = ~What was this Drawl creature?~
@4 = ~What's going on here?~
@5 = ~A gang couldn't have caused all this trouble.~
@6 = ~NP: I AM a guard, but I used to be one of the Sword Coast Boys. They never forgave me for going over to the enemy. Especially Drol. He probably wanted to show everyone by my example after he ... changed. I got off easy, probably... not like the others...~ /*I AM a guard, but I used to run with the Sword Coast Boys. They never forgave me for "joining the enemy." Especially Drawl.*/
@7 = ~I have questions about Drawl.~
@8 = ~I have questions about you, Walters.~
@9 = ~I have questions about the "others" you mentioned.~
@10 = ~I should get moving. What will you do now?~
@11 = ~NP: He used to be my friend when I was one of the Coast Boys. But he never forgave me for going over to the side of the enemy as a guard. He probably wanted to show everyone by my example after he ... changed. I got off easy, probably... not like the others...~ /*He used to be a friend of mine, back when I ran with the Sword Coast Boys. Never forgave me for "joining the enemy" as a guard.*/
@12 = ~NP: The Beggars Nest is apparently under siege by the undead. I dont know whats behind it, but it turned the Sword Coast Boys into who knows what. Drol seems to have made some sort of deal for the power he received. He ruined a whole gang... Some of them were my friends...~ /*The Beggar's Nest is obviously under siege by undead. I don't know what's doing it, but it sure made a mess of the Sword Coast Boys.*/
@13 = ~I have questions about the "others" you mentioned.~
@14 = ~NP: Yes. If you wanted to destroy Drol, then you know that now he has much more power than before, when he was an ordinary pathetic thief. Drol seems to have made some sort of deal for the power he received. He ruined a whole gang... Some of them were my friends...~ /*I agree. If you were in on destroying Drawl, you know that he had far too much power for the smalltime hood that he was.*/
@15 = ~I'll answer what I can, but we should keep it short. There are still zombies swarming the district. Killing Drawl didn't get rid of them.~
@16 = ~Should killing Drawl have stopped the zombies?~
@17 = ~I assume he wasn't always like this?~
@18 = ~I need to ask something else.~
@19 = ~About me? All right, but we should keep this short. There are still undead swarming all over the Beggar's Nest, and killing Drawl probably didn't get rid of them.~
@20 = ~Why did you quit the gang and become a guard?~
@21 = ~Where you supposed to patrol?~
@22 = ~Back to my general questions...~
@23 = ~NP: Since I left, Drol has kept the Sword Coast Boys in a tight grip. He didnt want anyone else to leave... at least not alive. A few weeks ago, it seems one of the guys tried to convince Drol to get the gang out of town. They wanted to escape the plague.~ /*Ever since I left, Drawl really tightened his grip on the Sword Coast Boys. He didn't want anyone else leaving... not alive, anyway.*/
@24 = ~What happened to them?~
@25 = ~Back to my other questions.~
@26 = ~I'd like to get out of here, of course. I don't know if I could make it to the main gates on my own unless the zombies were taken care of.~
@27 = ~NP: I think you should go to the gate.~ /*I think you should make a break for it.*/
@28 = ~Just wait here until I clear things out.~
@29 = ~NP: I doubt. Drol could not do all this himself. He was an idiot. Cool, but still an idiot. He was an ordinary dupe. Most likely, in order to stop the zombies, you need to find this creature Gulnan that Drol was talking about. But I dont know how to do it.~ /*Stopping the zombies probably means finding this "Gulnan" creature Drawl was bragging about. Don't know anything about how to do that, though.*/
@30 = ~Who helped this Drawl?~
@31 = ~Why would someone corrupt a gang like that?~
@32 = ~NP: Well, Drol would always be a scoundrel. He had big plans to make the Sword Coast Boys a mercenary company, but he was very lazy. All these were just dreams. The only thing that has changed is that he has become a *powerful* villain. He imagined himself to be a lich or something. He was too stupid to realize that he was just a pawn.~ /*The only thing that changed was that he became a *powerful* jerk. He thought he was a lich or something. He was too stupid to see he was just a pawn.*/
@33 = ~If he's just some kid, who gave him this power?~
@34 = ~I'll answer what I can. Anything to help people not end up like the others in the gang did.~
@35 = ~NP: Because its a promising job. Drol promised a lot, but never answered for his words. His plans never materialized, well, except for petty crimes. Since I became a guardian, I tried to rein him in all the time, but he did not want to listen to me. All the time looking for easy ways, despite the consequences.~ /*Because it's a job with a future. Drawl promised a lot, but he never delivered. His plans never accomplished anything but petty crime.*/
@36 = ~NP: I patrolled at the gates to the Heart of the City. They must have noticed my absence, but most likely they do not have enough people to send someone to look for me. Eventually, I will have to go back there. Though its not safe given the amount of undead.~ /*I was patrolling near the gate to the city core. They must have noticed I'm missing, but probably can't spare anyone to look.*/
@37 = ~I'll be here at the gate for now. I'm still a bit weak after being trapped in the warehouse.~
@38 = ~NP: The same thing that happened to all the guys. Drol made some kind of deal to become... what he became, and everyone else was killed. The whole old gang... its gone. But Im glad that Drol finally got what he deserved. Serve him.~ /*The same thing that happened to all of the boys. Drawl made some deal to become... whatever it was he became, and the rest of them were killed.*/
@39 = ~I suppose, but there are still a lot of undead swarming around. Drawl's benefactor is out there somewhere. I wish I wasn't so weak right now.~
@40 = ~NP: I dont know. He was talking about someone named Gulnan... saying he was his Evil Lieutenant. He must have given himself that title. The trash is unfinished. Whoever or whatever this Gulnan was, he and Drol must have met somewhere. Have you carefully checked the warehouse? There were some strange things going on there.~ /*Whoever or whatever Gulnan is, the two of them must have had a way to meet. Have you thoroughly checked the warehouse? Some strange things went on.*/
@41 = ~NP: Well, if someone wanted it, maybe they would make good squires. Better than mindless zombies. I dont know anything about the undead. Perhaps they just wanted to cause chaos... or to make the locals fear that even people without the plague might become dangerous to them...~ /*Well, if they got some willing people, maybe they'd make better henchmen than mindless zombies. I don't know anything about undead.*/
@42 = ~NP: He was constantly talking about someone. He seems to have mentioned the name Gulnan. I dont know who or what it is. Drol didnt say anything. Personally, I dont think he really knew. He was just glad that he had enough power to carry out his threats. I know that he often communicated with this Gulnan, so somewhere there must be some way of communication between them.~ /*Personally, I don't think he really knew. He was just happy to be tough enough to back up his threats for once.*/
@43 = ~NP: Drol is finally dead. Serve him. Naturally, I would like to get out of here. Not sure if I can get to the main gate on my own if the zombies are still there.~ [NWWALT55] /*I'd like to get out of here, of course. I don't know if I could make it to the main gates on my own unless the zombies were taken care of.*/
@44 = ~NP: Greetings. I hope you are fine. It seems that the situation in the Beggars Nest is finally getting better.~ [NWWALT55] /*Hello to you. I hope the day finds you well. Looks like things are finally settling down in the Beggar's Nest. The undead are gone.*/
@45 = ~Things are pretty quiet here at the gate now that the threat in this area is gone. Saves the guards a lot of worry.~
