@0 = ~MT: Greetings, latecomers. Forgive my disappointment, but your arrival did not bring me joy. But where are my manners? I am Bertrand. Forgive me my confusion. But I was hoping that... well, I shouldn't burden you with my problems.~ /*Greetings stragglers. Forgive my disappointment, but your arrival brings me no joy. Where are my manners? I am Bertrand.*/
@1 = ~What are you waiting for?~
@2 = ~MT: You just did it. What you need?~ /*You just did. Out with it. What do you want?*/
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~I have been watching for people fleeing the zombies. I've lost track of my brother in all the commotion and I was hoping he would come here.~
@5 = ~Tell me of your brother.~
@6 = ~Have you seen many survivors, or just zombies?~
@7 = ~Is this the only safe place he might have gone?~
@8 = ~I am sorry if I appeared to lead you, but as I said, I am distracted. I've been waiting for my brother. I lost him in all the commotion.~
@9 = ~Safe passage to you. You'll excuse me if I return to my vigil.~
@10 = ~His name is Marcus, Marcus Penhold. I shouldn't be worried. He's quite competent, and the heirloom he carries is powerful, too.~
@11 = ~I have not seen anyone by that name.~
@12 = ~He's probably dead in the streets.~
@13 = ~Marcus? Was he a mage, perhaps? Kept a Journal?~
@14 = ~MT: Powerful item? Maybe I should find him.~ /*Powerful? Maybe I should seek him out.*/
@15 = ~MT: Not many are willing to risk their lives traveling from place to place. This place is safe, but the way there is too difficult for most people. Many people are afraid to get together because of the plague. But isolation is not the best way to deal with zombies.~ /*Not many are willing to risk traveling. This place is safe, but getting here may be beyond the abilities of many people.*/
@16 = ~This is the most logical place for him to go. I hear the Shining Serpent is also fortified, but I don't think Marcus thought much of the place.~
@17 = ~That is unfortunate... but I am sure he is well. I will hear of him eventually.~
@18 = ~I'm sure he will turn up.~
@19 = ~I am sorry, but he fell to zombies. I found his body.~
@20 = ~Ha! He's dead! I saw his corpse under a dozen zombies!~
@21 = ~You don't know that. He is quite skilled, and I place more faith in my knowledge of him than in your simple insults.~
@22 = ~Yes, that sounds like him. Have you seen him, then?~
@23 = ~MT: I do not advise you to approach him with such a greedy look as yours. He is well brought up, but will not tolerate your claims. I wish you a happy journey. If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my service.~ /*I would not approach him with that greedy look in your eye. He is well-mannered, but will not abide your intent.*/
@24 = ~MT: I have no doubt. He could always take care of himself. I wish you a happy journey. If you'll excuse me, I'll return to my service.~ /*Safe passage to you. You'll excuse me if I return to my vigil.*/
@25 = ~That... that cannot be. I will not believe it. Not until I see his belongings with my own eyes.~
@26 = ~I swear to you, I saw his body. You will have to accept my word.~
@27 = ~MT: (Show diary) I came across his body. Look, here is my diary.~ /*I found his body. Look, I found his journal.*/
@28 = ~(Hold up staff) Do you recognize this staff? I found it on his body.~
@29 = ~Then live in denial, fool. I told you what I saw.~
@30 = ~I wish I could help.~
@31 = ~You mock me with your callous talk. I won't believe you, not until I see his belongings with my own eyes.~
@32 = ~MT: Your words ring true. Very true. I'll have to believe you. Damn, you definitely have to! He's dead... Then what are your intentions? Didn't he have anything? He was supposed to have a heirloom... a staff. I would love to have it back.~ /*What is your intention, then? Did he have anything on him? There was an heirloom that he carried... a staff. I would dearly love to have it returned.*/
@33 = ~I found his possessions. I could give them to you.~
@34 = ~Heh, I have his things now. Let's talk price.~
@35 = ~No, I require solid proof! Produce his possessions and I will believe. Until then, I will trust him to return!~
@36 = ~MT: You have demonstrated this book without a shadow of doubt in your eyes. I... I'll have to believe you. I... This is the first time I hear that he wrote something. And you ... What are you trying to achieve then? Do you have his diary... was there anything else? He had a family heirloom, which I will ask you to return.~ /*And you... what is your intention, then? You have his journal... was there anything else? He had a family heirloom that I would request be returned.*/
@37 = ~MT: He had this staff.~ /*Why you thinks that is?*/
@38 = ~MT: I don't have any of his other stuff.~ /*I have no time for this.*/
@39 = ~MT: No, I won't accept it. Maybe he had a diary, he never showed it. No, it can belong to anyone. I won't even look at him. If you want to convince me of his death, bring me the family staff he carried as a relic. He would never part with it. Until then, I will continue my wait.~ /*If you wish to convince me of his death, bring me the family staff he carried as an heirloom. He would never abandon it. Until then, I will maintain my vigil.*/
@40 = ~That... that staff is an heirloom of our family... he would not abandon it. He must be dead. I have to believe you. I have to...~
@41 = ~MT: Let's discuss the price.~ /*Let's talk about something different.*/
@42 = ~MT: Here, take the staff.~ /*Here, take the eggs.*/
@43 = ~MT: I won't believe anything until I see his stuff. He's alive, I know, just lost. You are wrong. Go. And take your cruelty with you. I need to keep looking.~ /*I will not believe it until I hold his belongings. He is just beyond my sight, I am sure. You are mistaken.*/
@44 = ~MT: Your words do not console me. I won't believe them until I see his stuff. I will not believe. Please let me keep looking. Please.~ /*Your words are no comfort. I won't believe it until I see his belongings. I wont.*/
@45 = ~I cannot believe...~
@46 = ~He had a journal. Take it.~
@47 = ~Actually, I was mistaken. I don't have his things.~
@48 = ~Price? Let me get this straight... you want me me to pay for the possessions of my dead brother? What kind of opportunist are you?~
@49 = ~I have his journal. I will give it to you.~
@50 = ~I demand payment for his journal.~
@51 = ~I have his staff. You can simply have it.~
@52 = ~I have his staff. You will pay well for it, I think.~
@53 = ~MT: It's very cruel. Leave me alone with my grief.~ /*If that's all, please just leave me to mourn.*/
@54 = ~MT: Well, it looks like I don't have a choice. If I want my family heirloom, which was held in the hands of my brother in his DEATH HOUR, apparently, I will have to pay. Well, so be it. Then here's my suggestion. I have 600 gold. No more, no less. I guess that will be enough?~ /*Well, I guess I have no choice. If I want my family heirloom that my brother carried to his DYING DAY, I guess I have to pay.*/
@55 = ~That will do nicely. Take the staff.~
@56 = ~That's not enough. I demand more.~
@57 = ~MT: Thank you. To tell you the truth, it was a terrible night. If I had to bargain for something worthy of only respect ... That would be terrible. Your gift is the only thing that will remain in my memory. I have no more gold left, but I thank you. Now please leave me alone with my thoughts.~ /*I thank you. I tell you, this has been a trying night. Having to pay for something that should be respected... horrible. At least your gift is my last memory.*/
@58 = ~This is a cruel jest. Leave me to my mourning. I don't have the patience for this sort of thing right now.~
@59 = ~MT: It's clear. Well, it looks like if I want to see the last words written by my brother, I'll have to pay. Well, okay. I have 400 gold. No more, no less. I guess that will be enough?~ /*Well, so be it. Here is my offer then. I have 400 gold. No more, no less. I assume it will be enough?*/
@60 = ~MT: This is enough. Get this stupid magazine.~ /*That will do nicely. Take the lousy journal.*/
@61 = ~No, that's not enough.~
@62 = ~I thank you. I can at least have this little piece of him back. It is no replacement but... it is something.~
@63 = ~MT: Take your damn dirty gold! May you choke on them!~ /*Follow me.  I have such sights to show you...*/
@64 = ~Listen, I have nothing more! That's it! I'm not going to waste time bargaining! I have 400! Take it or don't, but don't taunt me further!~
@65 = ~Well, then you get nothing.~
@66 = ~MT: I have nothing else! And don't bargain with me! Take it or not, stop mocking me!~ /*It has to be! I have nothing more! No nonsense bargaining! Whether you take it or don't, just stop taunting me!*/
@67 = ~Walk away then, dog. You are despicable. I hope the spirit of my brother haunts your dreams!~
@68 = ~A friendly face is a welcome sight. Only zombies have populated the vigil for my brother.~
@69 = ~MT: Greetings... You'll be safe here, although I don't know why I'm here... Now I know he's dead... The search for my brother is over. I know he is dead. I just... can't comprehend it. I can't reconcile.~ /*Hello there... You will find this place safe, though I don't know why I stay here... I know he is dead now...*/
@70 = ~It is a small solace, I suppose, but I am more accepting of his passage now. My brother was a good person, you know?~
@71 = ~It is strange, yes? The evil that grows within people when others are weak? I am glad my brother did not live to see what people are capable of.~
