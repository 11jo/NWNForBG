@0 = ~Bah! I got no time for newcomers. You want respect, you step up to the Pit.~
@1 = ~Okay, so maybe you could get past me, but there's no way you'll beat Fashi. Can't be done. No sir.~
@2 = ~You know, you are pretty tough if you got past Fashi for that Second Round Medal. Maybe you'll actually take Agar. Maybe.~
@3 = ~You got a Third Round Medal! I bet you might even be able to take Claudus! Maybe... (hushed) if he didn't have an "in" with the healer...~
@4 = ~Claudus got beat! It's worth closing the Gauntlet to see him get taken down.~
