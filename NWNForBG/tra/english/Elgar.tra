@0 = ~What are you lookin' at. Ain't ya never seen a half-orc druid before?~
@1 = ~Uh, sorry. I didn't mean to stare.~
@2 = ~Pretty sensitive for a big lug.~
@3 = ~Watch your tone, or I'll show you how unimpressed I am.~
@4 = ~Mm. Well be sure that ya don't go and do it again. Now, was there somethin' that you wanted, or are you just a gawker?~
@5 = ~Who are you?~
@6 = ~What is this place?~
@7 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@8 = ~Nevermind. Goodbye.~
@9 = ~You had better watch your smart mouth or I might plant you upside down in the ground and see if you grow into a tree. Har! Now, what can I do for ya?~
@10 = ~Har! A <PRO_MANWOMAN> with a spine! What an unusual thing. I'm not sure if I want to be your friend or cut your ugly mug off. Har. How can I help ya?~
@11 = ~My name is Elgar and I am the first circle defender for the challenges. What else do ya want to know?~
@12 = ~What are you talking about? What kind of circles are you defending?~
@13 = ~This is the Neverwinter Wood druid grove. This is where we meet to learn about and protect nature. It's also where we get to challenge ourselves in physical contests. That's my favorite part.~
@14 = ~What do you mean protect nature?~
@15 = ~What challenges are these?~
@16 = ~Aawill is the Archdruid. He's the one to go to if you want to assist the grove with something like the troubles we're having right now. Jaer is second-in-command, in charge of circle challenges.~
@17 = ~What kind of trouble is that?~
@18 = ~Right. Off with your nosey questions. Go find a big red dragon to chat with. Har!~
@19 = ~MT: А кого-нить другого спросить нельзя было? Ненавижу все объяснять. Ну ладно. Ежели ты друид, те надо проявить себя в бою. Тут четыре круга друидов, в этой роще. Извини, но это доступно только местным друидам. Чужаков мы не принимаем.~ /*I wish you'd ask someone else; I hate explaining stuff. All right. If you are a druid and you want to join this grove, you have to prove your worth in combat. There are four circles of druids in this grove.*/
@20 = ~MT: Ну тогда прощай.~ /*Farewell then.*/
@21 = ~The creatures in the woods have been acting vicious lately. Like they've gone mad. We could just kill them, but that's not what druids do. So Aawill is trying to save the Spirit of the Wood. You should talk to him if you want more details.~
@22 = ~So you're back now. What do ya want this time?~
@23 = ~MT: Я слыхал, ты договорился с Аавиллом о помощи лесу. Ну так иди, разберись там, что к чему.~ /*I hear that ye have a contract with the great druid Aawill. Very well then, good luck to ye.*/
@24 = ~MT: Так тебе просто так удалось решить все проблемы? Мои поздравления!~ /*How did you survive the attack?*/
@25 = ~MT: Ты убил духа леса! Проваливай, я не желаю с тобой говорить. Хар!~ /*Miss Bela say me shoulds talk to you.*/
