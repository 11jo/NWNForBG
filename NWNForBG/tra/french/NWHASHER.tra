@0 = ~Greetings, friend! Husher Clay at your service. Care to check out the wares here at this, the newest branch of my adventuring gear shops?~
@1 = ~What do you mean, the newest branch?~
@2 = ~I'd like to take a look at your inventory.~
@3 = ~I'm searching for the Words of Power.~
@4 = ~Well, I used to run a little place way down south. Business was good, but the big money is in franchising. So I left my son in charge of my store and headed north to expand my merchant empire. When I came across all these rich adventurers gathered here in Beorunna's Well, I figured this was the perfect place to set up my new shop, at least until I get a license to sell in Neverwinter.~ 
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~By all means! I never turn a customer away.~
@7 = ~Ah, I'm afraid that's something I don't actually have in stock. Ha-ha! But seriously, I'm afraid I don't know anything about that. You might want to speak with Lillian Cambridge, that archeological expert Aarin Gend brought in. She spends most of her time at the tavern, from what I've gathered.~ 
@8 = ~Good day to you then. Come back any time as this little shop is open night and day. And don't forget about my dwarven friend there in the corner. He's quite the accomplished smith. When it comes to arms and armor, if I don't stock it he can probably build it.~ 
@9 = ~Maybe you'll find her more helpful than I did.~
@10 = ~What do you mean?~
@11 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@12 = ~Is there anything else I can do for you?~
@13 = ~When I heard there was an archeologist nearby I went to speak with her about a certain item I've been trying to track down. But she wasn't really interested. Said she only wanted items of historical significance and that she didn't have time to chase after trinkets. I even offered her a generous reward, but she seemed more interested in the wine bottle on the table than my story.~ 
@14 = ~Maybe I could help you.~
@15 = ~Don't know if there's much I can tell you as I'm kind of new here myself. Just came up from the southern Sword Coast to oversee the opening of the newest branch of my operations.~
@16 = ~Maybe you could at that. You seem like a capable <MANWOMAN>. Tell you what, you help me out and I'll give you the payment I was offering Lillian.~
@17 = ~What kind of job?~
@18 = ~What's it pay?~
@19 = ~This does not interest me.~
@20 = ~In addition to my retail business, I'm also a collector of rare gems. Right now there's one particular gem I'm interested in: the Star Sapphire. The Star Sapphire is valuable, that I'll warrant you; but you'll never get more than 1000 gold from any other dealer. But it's interesting to me as a collector, so I'm offering more: I'll give you 3000 gold if you bring it back to me.~ 
@21 = ~I have the Star Sapphire right here.~ 
@22 = ~Why do you want it?~
@23 = ~I'll give you 3000 gold pieces, the same as I offered Lillian.~
@24 = ~Fair enough. If you change your mind let me know. Is there anything else I can do for you?~
@25 = ~Well done, my good <MANWOMAN>. And, as promised, here is your reward. 3000 gold pieces was the price agreed upon, I believe.~
@26 = ~Thank you, Husher.~
@27 = ~I went through a lot of trouble to get this gem for you, Husher. A *lot* of trouble.~
@28 = ~Dig a little deeper, Clay, or I'll rip out your guts and strangle you with your own intestines!~
@29 = ~The Star Sapphire was part of a dowry given to Layenne Cheroux, the youngest daughter of a powerful merchant family that flourished in Waterdeep nearly two centuries ago. But Layenne wasn't ready to resign herself to a life of wedlock. She was an aspiring mage, and the morning of her wedding she fled to the north to seek her fame and fortune.~ 
@30 = ~You're welcome, you're welcome, <SIRMAAM>.~ 

@32 = ~Well, I imagine this was quite difficult to acquire. I imagine surviving the tricks and traps of Layenne's tomb was no easy task. Very well, here is another 200 gold pieces. I've given you far more than the gem itself is worth, but I suppose that's the price I pay for being a collector.~ 
@33 = ~I'm sorry but I've already given you far more than the gem is worth, and we did have a deal. I'm not about to start renegotiating now.~
@34 = ~Okay.~
@35 = ~Now just... just settle down. You obviously feel quite strongly about this, but there's no need to get violent. Don't get all worked up. Here, take another 200 gold. That should be enough to smooth things over. Now let's just put this unpleasantness behind us and let bygones be bygones, shall we?~ 
@36 = ~According to the reports, Layenne became quite an accomplished wizard. She was powerful enough to foresee her own death and construct an elaborate, trap-filled tomb to inter her remains.~
@37 = ~And you think the Star Sapphire is still in her tomb?~
@38 = ~By all accounts the Star Sapphire was one of her most treasured possessions. It reminded her of the life she had left behind in Waterdeep. The Star Sapphire would make a nice addition to my collection. Bring it to me and I'll give you 3000 gold pieces, the same price I offered Lillian. It's far more than the sapphire is worth to a more typical buyer.~ 
@39 = ~Okay, I'll do it.~
@40 = ~Excellent. Nobody knows for certain where Layenne was buried, but it's rumored to be somewhere in the Coldwood. If anyone's ever found the exact location of her tomb, they never came back alive to report it. But don't let that scare you off. I'm sure it's nothing you can't handle. Just bring me the Star Sapphire once you find it and I'll give you your reward. Now, is there anything else?~

@42 = ~Hello again. Any luck in locating the Star Sapphire? Or did you come just to check out my wares? Nobody has more in stock than Husher Clay, I'm fond of saying.~
@43 = ~Tell me about the Star Sapphire again.~
@44 = ~I'll be going now.~
@45 = ~It was buried with the mage Layenne, in her tomb somewhere out in the Coldwood. Bring it back to me and I'll give you 3000 gold pieces, just like we agreed on earlier. Now, is there anything else you need?~ 
@46 = ~Ah, I'm afraid that's something I don't actually have in stock. Ha-ha! But seriously, I'm afraid I don't know anything about that. You might want to speak with Lillian Cambridge, that archeological expert Aarin Gend brought in. She spends most of her time at the tavern, from what I've gathered. Is there anything else I can do for you?~
