@0 = ~What reason have you for entering my home?~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~I was here before. Don't you remember?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~You come to my home and bother me with your petty questions? Like I don't have trouble enough.~
@5 = ~What trouble are you having?~
@6 = ~What can you tell me about Charwood?~
@7 = ~I seek the cult that prolonged the Neverwinter plague.~
@8 = ~No doubt I've seen you a million times by now, not that I'd ever remember it. We've got enough trouble without you.~
@9 = ~As you will. There's little I can do to stop you...~
@10 = ~My child has been taken from me, and while no one else in town seems to care, it bothers me a great deal! There's nothing I can do. That Quint Jhareg has taken my son, and what can I say about it? Nothing! Not even the Mayor can say anything... He's the one everyone's forgotten. He and Karlat were brothers and Lords of this place before we got... trapped here. He was a cleric of Lathander, once...~ /*He's the one everyone's forgotten. He and Karlat were brothers and Lords of this place before we got... trapped here. He was a cleric of Lathander, once...*/
@11 = ~Who's Karlat?~
@12 = ~Perhaps I can help?~
@13 = ~I still have some questions...~
@14 = ~It's a damned place. Anyone who strings you a story sayin' it isn't is one o' the people who damned it, Karlat Jhareg included.~
@15 = ~What do you mean?~
@16 = ~Who are the important people in town?~
@17 = ~Never-what? There is nowhere by Charwood. We've all forgotten. You won't find what you need in this town. We never did either, it seems... Karlat Jhereg might know what you want, but he's beyond caring about you, me... anything.~ /*Never-what? There is nowhere by Charwood. We've all forgotten. You won't find what you need in this town. We never did either, it seems...*/
@18 = ~Karlat Jhareg? He was a wizard, and powerful too. We thought Charwood would be safe at the foot of his castle. Well we were fools, weren't we...~
@19 = ~Where can I find this castle?~
@20 = ~What happened here?~
@21 = ~This ain't the fate we bargained for, but it's our fault. We settled at the feet of demons, we did... just to be safe... safe forever... Talk to the Mayor, he won't tell you. Talk to us, we won't tell you. None of us can say... none of us can finish it... it just goes on...~ /*Talk to the Mayor, he won't tell you. Talk to us, we won't tell you. None of us can say... none of us can finish it... it just goes on...*/
@22 = ~Where can I find the Mayor?~
@23 = ~I have other questions.~
@24 = ~Nobody here is important. Not the mayor, not me. Maybe Quint, but he's mad. Maybe you, but you don't understand. Maybe Karlat, who's to know?~
@25 = ~NP: It is at the far end of the village, behind the fortress wall. If you want to go there, go, but there is nothing waiting for you there but death, endless death.~ /*It's at the far end of town, beyond the gate. If you want to go there, go, but nothing but death awaits you there, endless death.*/
@26 = ~He's in the Town Hall in the heart of village... He's been in there for as long as anyone can remember, which isn't long at all...~
@27 = ~NP: Again and again in a circle with your stupid questions? Like I don't have enough problems without you.~ /*You come to my home and bother me with your petty questions? Like I don't have trouble enough.*/
@28 = ~Nobody said it was a concern for you. You asked, and I told, but I didn't ask you to come here. The Lords Jhareg do what they please, and damned if the rest of us aren't as much to blame for what happened in that castle! We're all to blame!~ /*The Lords Jhareg do what they please, and damned if the rest of us aren't as much to blame for what happened in that castle! We're all to blame!*/
@29 = ~That's enough. I don't care.~
@30 = ~No, I won't say... I won't say... I won't let it be known... This can repeat to eternity... and I won't let it be known...~
@31 = ~No one cares. That's the price we paid, I guess. No one cares, and it never ends... and I'll never let it be known...~
