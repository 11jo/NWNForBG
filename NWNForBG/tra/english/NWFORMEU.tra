@0 = ~You're not one of my captors, are you? No, I'd recognize your face if you were.~
@1 = ~What are you, prisoner or guard?~
@2 = ~Stand back! How do I know I can trust you?~
@3 = ~Relax - I set you free, didn't I?~
@4 = ~Well I *used* to be a guard... until the Head Gaoler turned everything upside down, at any rate. Look, I'm with the good guys, all right?~
@5 = ~Then I could use some information.~
@6 = ~Think you can make your way out of here alone?~
@7 = ~Okay, get out of here, then. I've cleared the way for you.~
@8 = ~Look at me, I'm unarmed. If I knew anything about magic, I would have been out of here long ago... Look, the name's Commander Ralston, all right?~
@9 = ~I thought maybe you're one of them come to take me downstairs... I'm Commander Ralston, by the way. I used to be in charge of this floor.~
@10 = ~All right but the sooner I get home to my family, the happier I'll be.~
@11 = ~How did you end up in that cell in the first place?~
@12 = ~What do you know about the prisoners?~
@13 = ~Any suggestions as to what we do now?~
@14 = ~NP: Okay, enough questions. Can you get out of here alone?~ /*Think you can make your way out of here alone?*/
@15 = ~I don't know but I'm going to try. I figure if I make a run for it, I can make it out the main door. I figure the militia must have this place surrounded by now.~ /*I don't know but I'm going to try. I figure if I make a run for it, I can make it out the main door.*/
@16 = ~I could use some information before you go.~
@17 = ~NP: Yes,<SIRMAAM> ! Wish me luck.~ /*Yes <SIRMAAM>! Wish me luck.*/
@18 = ~Hard to say. One afternoon, the Head Gaoler just went down and unlocked the door to the Pits. He walked right in there and all the prisoners walked right out. The fighting lasted a couple of days but all us guards have been captured now... or worse.~ /*He walked right in there and all the prisoners walked right out. The fighting lasted a couple of days but all us guards have been captured now... or worse.*/
@19 = ~The Pits? What are those?~
@20 = ~And the Head Gaoler?~
@21 = ~The former prisoners, you mean? They're cruel, vengeful. When they came, we weren't ready for them. I saw a dozen friends cut down around me. It was horrible, <SIRMAAM>! They threw a bunch of us guards into the Pits, too. For the Head Gaoler, they said... like he's going to eat them or something!~ /*It was horrible, <SIRMAAM>! They threw a bunch of us guards into the Pits, too. For the Head Gaoler, they said... like he's going to eat them or something!*/
@22 = ~I don't know about you but I'm heading home to my wife and kids. Set the whole place on fire as far as I'm concerned.~
@23 = ~NP: How did you end up in this cell?~ /*How did you end up in that cell in the first place?*/
@24 = ~That's where we throw the prisoners we can't handle. It's every man for himself down there.~
@25 = ~Apparently he's still down there. The prisoners have damn well crowned him king. If you ask me, the Wailing's got him and driven him mad...~
@26 = ~Well, seems like all the prisoners have had the fight scared out of them. Whatever you did, I'm grateful. You saved what few of us guards are left. Nothing keeping me here now. I'm getting home to my family. If you hadn't cleaned this place out, I'd have said burn it behind me.~ /*Nothing keeping me here now. I'm getting home to my family. If you hadn't cleaned this place out, I'd have said burn it behind me.*/
@27 = ~Good luck to you. I got nothing else to say.~
