@0 = ~NP: Hello, I'm Dumal, Guardian Knight of Helm. It's nice to see a sane face amongst the lunatics. I guess being locked up is better than being tortured, but at least during these meetings you could leave if the rhetoric got tiresome.~ [DUMAL50] /*I suppose being caged is better than torture, but at least during those sessions I could pass out if I tired of their rhetoric.*/
@1 = ~Who are you? How did you get here?~
@2 = ~What have you heard? What happened here?~
@3 = ~What do you know of this cult?~
@4 = ~NP: Before the invasion, the Castle was my home. But a third of us were spies. traitors. It was horrible. They killed most of us, but we weren't their ultimate target. It was all just to support some other attack. A day ago, Dester came back with some new plan. I thought for sure I was going to be killed, but apparently he forgot about me.~ /*They killed most of us, but we weren't even their target. It was just to support an attack somewhere else.*/
@5 = ~I have to find Desther. I have to go.~
@6 = ~NP: Mostly yelling. I think something bad happened to those sectarians. I think their agents in Neverwinter have been abandoned. Dester was their leader, but now for some reason they don't need him anymore. And then he started raising the dead everywhere. It's disgusting. It looks like he wants to gather his own powers, but I doubt the sect of these "Ancients" will be impressed. Whether he is one of these 'Eye Men' or not, he seems to be finished.~ /*Looks like he's trying to gather power for himself, but I doubt this "Old One" cult will be impressed. Whether he's one of these "People of the Eye" or not, they seem done with him.*/
@7 = ~NP: Do you know anything about these Ancients?~ /*Do you know anything specific about these "Old Ones?"*/
@8 = ~NP: That's insane! These Eyes Men are all fanatics, content to act as cogs in their masters' machine, even if it means nothing! They attacked Neverwinter for no good reason, at least no stated reason! Without them, there would have been no epidemic. Perhaps their base is in the north, but this is the first I've heard of the Eye Men and these Ancients~ /*Madness! These "People of the Eye" are all fanatics, content to be a cog in their master's machine, even if it makes no sense!*/
@9 = ~I'd come with you but I wouldn't be any help. I'm too weak. If you have any other questions, I'll be here until the fighting stops.~
@10 = ~Sorry, no, I have not been in a position to ask more pointed questions, and Desther has not been forthcoming with information.~
@11 = ~I hope your battle goes well. Do you need me?~ [DUMAL51]
