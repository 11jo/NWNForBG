@0 = ~I sense the stink of Tyr upon you. I hear that Oleff has you running errands? Maybe it displeases you? Care to hear an offer?~
@1 = ~I will listen. What is it you wish to say?~
@2 = ~Speak, but waste my time and you'll regret it.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Oh so polite. Bah! I have no use for manners. Can you steal and can you kill? That's what I need.~
@5 = ~I do what needs to be done. What is your offer?~
@6 = ~I do not commit evil acts!~
@7 = ~Ahh, you answer rude and rough. Are you what I need? Can you steal and kill? Or are you an indignant lackey of Tyr? We shall see.~
@8 = ~Off you go. Puppet. Dog.~
@9 = ~NP: This &quot;justice&quot; of Tyr took over the whole city. Talona would like... For something to happen. Something that would undermine the Tyrannian faith. My name is Jills. I need someone who will shamelessly rob the Tyrans of what they want. Do you understand me? You received a letter from Oleff asking you to find some graves, and in them - artifacts. This fool wants to strengthen the spirit of the people.~ /*The "justice" of Tyr has a sickening grip on this city. Talona would like to see... something happen. Something that will shake the Tyrran faith.*/
@10 = ~I'm sure your quaint morality lets you sleep deep and long. Come back when you tire of being an errand <PRO_GIRLBOY> for Tyr and Oleff.~
@11 = ~These relics of Halueth Never could benefit the church of Talona, perhaps be warped to her will. And if not, they should be destroyed.~
@12 = ~You wish me to bring them to you instead of Oleff?~
@13 = ~Even in times of plague you scheme. How petty.~
@14 = ~NP: Oleff and his minions cannot guarantee that these items will exorcise the plague. We only know that they can be very powerful. This wealth should not fall into their hands. Bring everything to me, not Oleff, you will get much more money from me.~ /*Oleff and his brethren have no guarantees that these items will stop the plague. They just know they could prove powerful.*/
@15 = ~Why do you think I am working for Oleff?~
@16 = ~What are the tenets of your faith in Talona?~
@17 = ~I will bring the artifacts to you instead of Oleff.~
@18 = ~I have no interest in this.~
@19 = ~Talona is her most active while people languish beneath disease. That is her domain, no matter if she caused the plague or not.~
@20 = ~NP: I have eyes all over the city. They say you have a letter from Oleff, with which his Tyrans will let you in. I'm wondering if you're doing this for the faith, or for the gold. If for the sake of gold, then I will give more. Easier nowhere. In addition, I was at the excavations on the peninsula. They need people like you. Their brethren are dying like flies.~ /*I have eyes around the city. They say you carry a letter from Oleff, compelling his fellow Tyrrans to let you pass.*/
@21 = ~You were at the tomb and didn't help the dying?~
@22 = ~NP: The Poison Mistress enjoys illness and everything that corrupts the body. She gets stronger when everyone else gets weaker. So they say... The plague is not her doing, although we are very happy to receive tribute from those who wish to please Talona. Talona is the balance of life and death, but death is stronger. She must be revered and feared, otherwise she will kill you when you are at your weakest.~ /*Talona is life and death in balance, but death is the stronger. She is to be worshipped and feared, lest she strike you down when you are weakest.*/
@23 = ~NP: Well, of course! You understand how weak these fools are, and they do not appreciate you at all. But I appreciate you. Bring me their &quot;holy artifacts&quot;. They will be corrupted and destroyed. Your evil intentions will come in handy.~ /*Bring me their "holy artifacts." They will be despoiled and twisted. Your evil intent is a welcome addition to our cause.*/
@24 = ~NP: Ah-ha! But my words hit you to the core! You will still remember me every time Oleff underpays you. I'll wait here. Decide what you're worth, and I'll wait.~ /*Ah HA! But I have planted the seed, and you will think about it each time you are underpaid by Oleff.*/
@25 = ~NP: I pocketed some of their stuff. I took a fine pen from one of them. I think his name was Jacob. He won't need it anymore. I think he died. He didn't react at all when I turned him over to empty his pockets.~ /*He won't be needing it. I assume he's dead. He didn't react much when I rolled him over to go through his pockets.*/
@26 = ~That's despicable! Give me Jacob's quill NOW!~
@27 = ~Take this path and I'm gone for good, fool! Walk in their shadow or walk with me! Either way, this is never mentioned again! Choose!~
@28 = ~Give me the Quill now, you evil bastard!~
@29 = ~Hmph! Puppet! Peon! Shove your trinket, your morals, and your blind righteousness where the light of Tyr doesn't shine!~
@30 = ~Go on with you, I got no reason to talk and you've got no reason to ask.~
@31 = ~NP: Hello again. Do you require anything? I hope you don't draw attention to me for no reason. Have you found the artifacts of Halwet Never? The followers of Talona need them very much. Tyr won't get his trinkets.~ /*Hello again, . Is there something you require? I hope you are not attracting attention to me for no reason.*/
@32 = ~I have an artifact from one of the tombs.~
@33 = ~Go over what is needed again.~
@34 = ~Yeah yeah, I'll look into it sometime.~
@35 = ~Well hand it over, fool! I'm not paying for your oh so eloquent words!~
@36 = ~Describe the recovery of the Ancient Chronicles of Never.~
@37 = ~Describe the recovery of Halueth Never's rusted armor.~
@38 = ~Describe the recovery of the ancient Holy Symbol of Tyr.~
@39 = ~NP: Sorry, that was a joke.~ /*I suppose it was fate.*/
@40 = ~NP: You received a letter from Oleff asking you to find some graves, and in them - artifacts. This fool wants to strengthen the spirit of the people. These relics of Haluet Nevers could be useful to Talona's church, perhaps bending them to her will. And if not, then they must be destroyed. Oleff and his minions cannot guarantee that these items will exorcise the plague. We only know that they can be very powerful.~ /*These relics of Halueth Never could benefit the church of Talona, perhaps be warped to her will. And if not, they should be destroyed.*/
@41 = ~This is a resource that must be denied them. Bring the items to me instead of Oleff and I will pay you far more than what he would've.~
@42 = ~Don't pester me unless you have news of benefit to the followers of Talona! Do not tempt her wrath!~
@43 = ~Self-indulgent tripe! These chronicles will make fine kindling at the next gathering of malagents at Daernuth. What a festival that shall be!~
@44 = ~NP: The shell of Haluet Never himself! He stinks them all from the inside. My craftsmen will see what use can be made of it. We'll probably beat it into a shovel and give it to the city's stables. Just right.~ /*The very shell that Halueth Never wore! The stink of him is thick inside it. My masters shall see that it is put to good use.*/
@45 = ~Well now, wouldn't Oleff like to get his hands on this, hmm? I shall see that it is... properly disposed of.~
@46 = ~NP: Here, get 2000 gold. That's way more than Oleff can give, and I can pay more! What happiness! They will never know about Halwet! What a triumph for the Poison Lady! But not everything has been found. There are also artifacts. Bring them to me and I will give you as much gold as your black soul desires! And I'll pay even more when they're all found!~ /*There are further artifacts. Bring them to me and I shall reward your black soul with gold to bathe in! And more when they are all delivered!*/
@47 = ~NP: Victory! Tyr will never get these things! Whatever awaits us ahead, this viciously sweet victory will remain with Talona! Take another 4000 gold and remember that Talona can spare you from now on. That's all you deserve!~ /*A victory! Tyr shall never know these things! Whatever the future brings, Talona shall always have this sweet spiteful victory!*/
@48 = ~NP: Here, get 2000 gold. I want to say if you deserve it! The fact that the rest of the artifacts ended up with Oleff is entirely your fault! It may have been an attempt on your part to clear your conscience, but it won't work that way. I'll see to it that Talona's followers use what we already have to harass the idiot worshipers of Tyr. Get out of my sight.~ /*That is, if you deserved it! You allowed other of these artifacts to be returned to Oleff! Perhaps you were trying to spare your conscience, but it will do no good.*/
@49 = ~The Lady of Poison will not suffer these distractions. Get to your task!~
@50 = ~What in the Hells do you want? What reason would I have to speak with you?~
@51 = ~You have served well, but the followers of Talona are done with you. Leave me be.~
@52 = ~How did you know of the artifacts to begin with?~
@53 = ~NP: After all, someone had already delivered Oleff some of those disgustingly clean artifacts of Tyr. Oh yes, I have spies there too! Do you really think that you can come back here like that and expect praise for the fact that all this happened? What are you, dumbass? Ugh! Get out of my sight!~ /*Did you think you could return to me and expect accolades for allowing this to happen? Are you a fool? Bah! Get out of my sight!*/
@54 = ~NP: I have eyes all over the city. In addition, I was at the excavations on the peninsula. They need people like you. Their brethren are dying like flies.~ /*Besides, I visited the dig in the Peninsula district. They need to hire outsiders like you. Their own brethren are falling like flies.*/
@55 = ~You were there and didn't help the dying?~
@56 = ~NP: What in the name of the nine abysses do you want? Why do you think I should even talk to you? Someone had already delivered to Oleff all those disgustingly clean artifacts of Tyr. Oh yes, I have spies there too! Do you really think that you can expect praise for the fact that all this happened? What are you, dumbass? Ugh! Get out of my sight!~ /*Did you think you could return to me and expect accolades for allowing this to happen? Are you a fool? Bah! Get out of my sight!*/
