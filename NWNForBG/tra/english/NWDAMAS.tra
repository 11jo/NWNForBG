@0 = ~NP: Hey! This is the commanders private quarters! I dont want all sorts of martinets shying away here ... oh, sorry,<LADYLORD> . I thought it was one of the soldiers. Please forgive my temper - I would not say that Commander Damas is a man without manners. How can I serve you?~ [NWDAMA56] /*Hey! This is the Commander's quarters! I don't want you enlisted men traipsing through... oh, sorry, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I thought you were one of my soldiers.*/
@1 = ~I have some questions.~
@2 = ~You contaminated the Elk tribe with these plague infected blankets!~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~As you wish, though between the endless complaints of my soldiers and this war against Luskan I don't have much time to spare.~
@5 = ~NP: Why are the soldiers complaining?~ /*Why are your soldiers complaining so much?*/
@6 = ~Do you know why the Elk tribe has allied itself with Luskan?~
@7 = ~Do you know anything about the Words of Power?~
@8 = ~I suppose I could spare you some time. Though between the catapults bombarding us and the endless complaints of my recruits I've already got enough headaches.~
@9 = ~The catapults have been destroyed.~
@10 = ~Maybe I could do something about those catapults.~
@11 = ~I suppose I could spare you some time, though between the Uthgardt siege and the endless complaints of my recruits I've already got enough headaches.~
@12 = ~I have the head of the Uthgardt sub-chief.~
@13 = ~I have the head of Zokan Thunderer.~
@14 = ~I suppose I could spare you some time, though between endless complaints of my recruits and the alliance between the Uthgardt Elk tribe and Luskan I've already got enough headaches.~
@15 = ~NP: So what if I did? Utgardts are just primitive savages! Their time is over. We have the power to wipe them off the face of the earth, and that gives us the *right* to do so! These blankets dont change anything. Were at war here! Utgardts are enemies, remember? Theyve bonded with Luskan!~ /*So what if I did? The Uthgardt are nothing but primitive savages! Their time is over. We have the strength to remove them from their land, and that gives us the *right* to remove them!*/
@16 = ~Fine, you've made your point. The Uthgardt Elk tribe deserves death.~
@17 = ~NP: The only reason the Elk tribe joined Luskan was that they promised them a cure for their disease!~ /*The only reason the Elk tribe joined Luskan is because they were promised a cure for the plague you gave them!*/
@18 = ~I don't care about the Elk tribe, but I want to profit from this somehow!~
@19 = ~As you wish, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. If you need anything else, I am at your disposal.~
@20 = ~NP: They are soft and weak! They only whine about how they miss their families and cry to return to the abandoned households and farms! But, is it not clear that there is a war going on! Fort Ilkard must be defended if we are to win this war! And it will be very useful if my soldiers do not ask questions on my every order. Now if you dont need anything else...~ /*Fort Ilkard has to be defended if we are to win this war! And it would help if my soldiers wouldn't question my every command. Now, if there is nothing else...*/
@21 = ~Who knows how the minds of those animals works? They probably just saw a chance to kill and pillage and jumped at it!~
@22 = ~Maybe you could negotiate a truce with the Uthgardt Elk tribe.~
@23 = ~NP: Ah, you must be one of Aarin Gends agents. He made you roam the wilderness looking for those mysterious lost artifacts, right? To me, this is a stupid assignment. The war can be won thanks to the soldiers, and not some kind of Words of Power.~ /*Ah, you must be one of Aarin Gend's agents. Got you traipsing all over the countryside searching out these mysterious lost artifacts, doesn't he?*/
@24 = ~NP: This is great news! Of course, I should have guessed that it was your work. Therefore, you will be rewarded. Here, 1500 gold for your act of wanton destruction. Good income, right?~ /*This is excellent news! Of course I must assume that you are the one responsible for this. Therefore you shall be the one to receive your reward.*/
@25 = ~Tell you what: you go out and disable all six catapults attacking the fort, and I'll make sure you get a healthy reward from the Fort Ilkard treasury. Now, if there is nothing else...~

@27 = ~NP: Fabulous! I order this to be put on a spear in front of the gates of Fort Ilkard immediately! For the successful removal of the siege of Fort Ilkard, I am pleased to present you with these 1000 gold pieces! The benefit that you can bring is obvious, so I want to ask you for one more favor.~ /*Since you have proven yourself so useful already, there is something else I would ask of you.*/
@28 = ~NP: The Elk tribe has been destroyed! The world is spared from their evil presence. Finally, these lands are cleared of these wandering savages! Your reward. Certainly. 2000 gold is a fair price. By working for me, you may well become rich.~ /*And the Elk tribe is no more! The world is rid of their vile presence. At last, the lands have been cleansed of those wandering savages!*/

@30 = ~Glad we could see eye to eye on this. Now, if there's nothing else...~
@31 = ~You don't really believe that, do you? You think if I hand over the cure the Elk tribe will suddenly abandon their Luskan allies? Uh... not that I have a cure on me...~
@32 = ~I know you have the cure. Now hand it over.~
@33 = ~Hand over the cure or I'll make you suffer until you wish you had the plague yourself!~
@34 = ~NP: <MALEFEMALE>, which willingly dooms the entire Elk tribe to death from the plague for nothing more than money, undoubtedly deserves admiration! Im not going to pay you just because you and I think the same way. Really, why should I do that?~ /*I admire a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who would be willing to let the entire Elk tribe die from the plague in exchange for a simple payoff.*/
@35 = ~NP: Pay me to keep quiet and I wont tell anyone that you have infected the Elk tribe with the plague.~ /*You buy my silence and I won't tell anyone about your plan to infect the Elk tribe with the plague.*/
@36 = ~I've changed my mind. The Elk tribe doesn't deseve this. Hand over that plague cure.~
@37 = ~How can you even ask that? The Uthgardt are ruthless killers who prey on the weak and defenseless! They must be exterminated like the disease they are! Now, if there is nothing else...~
@38 = ~Okay, let's not do anything crazy. You attack me and every soldier in this fort will come to the defense of their Commander. But I'm a reasonable man... Tell you what, I'll sell you the cure for 3000 gold pieces.~
@39 = ~I guess I don't have much choice. Here' s your gold.~
@40 = ~I think I'll just take the cure from your cold dead hands instead.~
@41 = ~Your price is too high. Forget it! I'm out of here!~
@42 = ~NP: Even if you tell people what I did, it wont change anything. Maybe I will get a reprimand from my superiors, but this will not have any serious consequences. Although a reprimand is always a lot of bureaucracy. Perhaps I can do without it. Lets do this - you give me these blankets and you keep my little plan to destroy the Elk tribe a secret, and I will give you 300 gold.~ /*Still, a reprimand would mean a lot of paperwork I can do without. Tell you what - you give me those blankets and keep my little plan to exterminate the Elk tribe secret and I'll give you 100 gold pieces.*/
@43 = ~Deal.~
@44 = ~Make it 200.~
@45 = ~NP: To the south of this fort are some abandoned ruins. A team of my scouts once went there, and there they discovered strange ruins. Nearby, they found the entrance to a cave, and inside were some ancient ruins. No one knows who built them, but according to my scouts, they dont look like dwarf, elf, or human ruins.~ /*Nearby they found a glowing cave entrance, and inside were some ancient ruins. Nobody seems to know who built them, but according to my scouts they didn't look like dwarven, elven or human architecture.*/
@46 = ~NP: Is it true? Well, then I cant help you much. Those old ruins to the south are the only place I know of that might still hold some ancient magic. Well, I think its time for you to go, and I should get back to managing this fort.~ /*Really? Well, then I guess I can't be much help to you then. Those old ruins way to the south are the only place I know of that might have some kind of ancient magic.*/
@47 = ~NP: I knew that we could come to an agreement. Heres the cure. If you still change your mind, and decide that the Utgardts do not belong on this earth, bring me the head of their leader Zokan. Now, if youll excuse me, Ill get back to my business.~ /*If you change your mind and decide you'd rather exterminate these Uthgardt after all, just bring me back the head of their leader Zokan.  Now, if you'll excuse me I have business to attend to.*/

@49 = ~Guards, help! Enemy in the compound!~
@50 = ~To the death, then!~
@51 = ~NP: Cant blame you. I myself would not waste my own money on these savages. My previous offer still stands. You know, the one where you act like a soldier and kill your enemies instead of saving them. If you still change your mind, and decide that the Utgardts do not belong on this earth, bring me the head of their leader Zokan. Now, if youll excuse me, Ill get back to my business.~ /*Can't say I blame you. I wouldn't spend my own money to save those savages either. My earlier offer still stands. You know, the one where you act like a soldier and kill our enemies instead of saving them?*/
@52 = ~A pleasure doing business with you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I'll make sure these blankets are burnt and nobody will ever have to worry about them again.~
@53 = ~NP: I dont think you realize how little I care about this. I just want to avoid some annoying questions about my actions, but Im not going to pay a fortune for this. If you dont want my gold, keep these blankets. I really dont care. I give you one last chance to accept my offer. Want to get 300 gold?~ /*I think you underestimate how little I really care about this. I want to avoid some inconvenient questions about my activities, but I'm not going to give away a fortune to do it.*/
@54 = ~Forget it.~
@55 = ~NP: As I said, in my opinion, these Words of Power are a waste of time. But if you are determined to find them, I advise you to head south until you see these ruins. Well, I think its time for you to go, and I should get back to managing this fort.~ /*Like I said, I think these Words of Power are a waste of time. But if you're determined to search them out I'd suggest you head south until you see those pillars of light. The glowing cave entrance should be just east of there.*/
@56 = ~However, I wouldn't want anyone to think I'm being uncooperative with one of Aarin's agents. Have you searched those old ruins to the south? That's your best bet.~
@57 = ~Ruins?~
@58 = ~I've already been there.~
@59 = ~If that's the way you want to be, fine. Keep the blankets.~
@60 = ~If you desire even more gold, I have another job you might be interested in. The Uthgardt siege is still a problem, even without their catapults lobbing death from above.~
@61 = ~NP: I want to have the head of Arness, the Uthgardts junior leader who leads the siege, brought to me! I will put his skull on a spear in front of the fort gates, and the Utgardts will think twice before they decide to storm Fort Ilkard again! Of course, I will see to it that you are given a rich reward for such a gift. Now, if nothing else... Ill mind my own business.~ /*You could bring me the head of Arness, the Uthgardt sub-chief in charge of this siege! I stick his melon on a pole outside the gates, and the Uthgardt will think twice before attacking Fort Ilkard again!*/

@63 = ~NP: The best way to break the alliance between Luskan and the Elk tribe is to kill the leader of the Utgardts, Zokan the Thunderer. Without their commander, the Elk tribe will fall apart. And that will be the end of the union. The chieftain of the Uthgardts dug in at the old fort to the west of here. The damned coward hasnt come out of there for weeks! Bring me his head and you will be well rewarded.~ /*The best way to break the Luskan - Elk tribe alliance is to kill off the Uthgardt chief, Zokan Thunderer. Without Zokan to guide them, the Elk tribe will fall apart. And that will be the end of the alliance.*/

@65 = ~Why have you come back? I already gave you the cure for the Elk tribe - what more do you want from me?~
@66 = ~I see you have returned, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Is there something further I can do for you?~
