@0 = ~What? Who? Oh, pardon me. I didn't notice you there. I was rather engrossed in my contemplations of the time stream. It's easy to get lost in their paradoxical currents, if I do say so myself.~ [NWSAPP56]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Time stream? What in Faerun are you talking about?~
@3 = ~What exactly is it you do here?~
@4 = ~I'm searching for the Words of Power.~
@5 = ~I'll be going now.~
@6 = ~Don't you remember me? Oh, wait... maybe we haven't met yet. It's hard to keep things straight without a linear temporal reference in the time stream. No matter. I am Sapphira the Wild Mage.~
@7 = ~A wild mage. No wonder you're talking crazy.~
@8 = ~Time stream, temporal reference... What are you talking about?~
@9 = ~I can't take anymore of this. I'm out of here.~
@10 = ~I suppose I should start at the beginning. Ha-ha. Get it: the beginning? A little time travel joke. In a recursively accessible time stream a begining, by definition, cannot exist! Now do you see what's so funny? No? Nevermind.~
@11 = ~Are you completely insane?~
@12 = ~Could you just get to the point please?~
@13 = ~I have already told you my purpose here... or will tell you. It amounts to the same thing when all is said and done I suppose. When you travel the time stream cause meets effect meets cause ad nauseum.~
@14 = ~I already told you that I think the Word of Power you seek is inside the ruins of this vault! Oh, wait, maybe I didn't already tell you. Have we met before, or are we going to meet in the future? Nevermind, it doesn't really matter. What I told you... or will tell you when we meet later in the time stream... is that you won't get that Word without my help. Not with those guardian golems in the way.~ /*I already told you that I think the Word of Power you seek is inside the ruins of this vault! Oh, wait, maybe I didn't already tell you. Have we met before, or are we going to meet in the future? Nevermind, it doesn't really matter.*/
@15 = ~Guardian golems?~
@16 = ~Will you help me?~
@17 = ~Well, I hope you find it. As for me, I'm just going to wait here for a few days. It's taken this Ultarg tree ten thousand years to get to this stage, and I can't afford to miss my chance when the fruit blossoms.~
@18 = ~Well then, goodbye. We shall meet again soon... or is it that we already met in the past? It's so hard to keep this stuff straight.~
@19 = ~Don't go jumping to conclusions. Just because I'm a wild mage and the Realms foremost leading expert on time travel does not mean I am insane. You are simply too blind to see the reason of my words! I'm sorry. I sometimes forget temporal displacement is a confusing subject. Let me explain. I will try to keep this brief and simple.~ /*Don't go jumping to conclusions. Just because I'm a wild mage and the Realms foremost leading expert on time travel does not mean I am insane. You are simply too blind to see the reason of my words!*/
@20 = ~I'm sorry. I sometimes forget temporal displacement is a confusing subject. Let me explain. I will try to keep this brief and simple.~
@21 = ~Powerful constructs virtually immune to all physical and magical damage, all but indestructible. They patrol the ruins of the vault, but I know a way to avoid them.~
@22 = ~I could be of assistance to you, provided you will do something for me. I am a researcher in fluid temporality... time travel, if you will. That is why I am here in these ruins. Because they were built on a time sink.~ /*I am a researcher in fluid temporality... time travel, if you will. That is why I am here in these ruins. Because they were built on a time sink.*/
@23 = ~Time travel. Right...~
@24 = ~Time sink?~
@25 = ~I don't really have time for this.~
@26 = ~I am a researcher in fluid temporality... time travel, if you will. That is why I am here in these ruins. Because they were built on a time sink.~
@27 = ~You scoff, but subjective temporality is a fact. Time travel's not easy, you understand. And backward is much simpler than forward. But it is possible, on a time sink.~
@28 = ~A time sink is an area where it is possible to tap into the time stream and travel backwards in time... though not forwards, unless you are returning to the temporal reality you started from.~
@29 = ~Waiting for the tree to blossom and drop its fruit. It might take another week, maybe even a month. But this chance only comes once every ten thousand years. I can't afford to miss it.~
@30 = ~Of course such a thing is not easily accomplished. It requires old and powerful magic. Fortunately, the Creator Race has already done the hard work for us by building the sun dials.~
@31 = ~Do you know anything about this Creator Race?~
@32 = ~Are the sun dials still working?~
@33 = ~They were a brutal people, enslaving the other races with their powerful magic. Physically the Creator Race resemble the lizard people of our own time. I have seen them when using the sun dials to travel to the past.~
@34 = ~They are, if you know how to use them. I could teach you how to travel back to the ancient past, when these ruins were still being built. But you have to perform a task for me.~
@35 = ~What's the task?~
@36 = ~Forget it, I'm not your lackey!~
@37 = ~They are, but you need a time crystal to use them. I'm afraid I don't have any time crystals to spare or I'd give you one myself. If you had a time crystal you would just use the special property of the time crystal and target the effect on the sun dial to be sucked back into the past. To come back, just use the crystal again on the sun dial and you'll be transported back to the present age.~ /*If you had a time crystal you would just use the special property of the time crystal and target the effect on the sun dial to be sucked back into the past. To come back, just use the crystal again on the sun dial and you'll be transported back to the present age.*/
@38 = ~I need the fruit of the rare Ultarg tree. I have the seeds, but the tree only bears fruit every ten thousand years or so. What I need you to do is use the time sink to go back in time and plant the tree for me.~
@39 = ~Just remember the rules of time travel. One: you can't leave the area of the time sink. Physically impossible, which means you won't be able to leave the vault complex once you are in the past. Two: you can't bring any items of power back from the past into the present. When you return only the stuff you brought with you in the first place and mundane items can make the trip home with you.~ /*Just remember the rules of time travel. One: you can't leave the area of the time sink. Physically impossible, which means you won't be able to leave the vault complex once you are in the past.*/
@40 = ~Sounds simple.~
@41 = ~That's what you said at our next meeting! Anyway, that's about all I can tell you about time travel.~
@42 = ~According to my research, the only place you can safely plant the seeds and have the tree bear fruit is beneath the red warding rune painted on the soil of this garden. Plant the tree in the past, and I'll be waiting here in the present to harvest the fruit.~
@43 = ~Okay, I'll do it.~
@44 = ~What's in this for me?~
@45 = ~Why don't you do this yourself?~
@46 = ~You won't get very far if you don't know how to use the sun dials. I've actually got a notebook that explains it all. It's pretty simple. Here, take the notebook. And these Ultarg tree seeds you promised to plant. Oh, and you'll need this time crystal. The time crystals are magic items with a special use.~ /*I've actually got a notebook that explains it all. It's pretty simple. Here, take the notebook. And these Ultarg tree seeds you promised to plant. Oh, and you'll need this time crystal. The time crystals are magic items with a special use.*/
@47 = ~Don't worry, I'll see you are well paid for your troubles. I've made a fortune in gambling over the years. Plus, using the sun dial to go back to the age of the Creator Race will send you to a time before the guardian golems were created.~
@48 = ~I've had enough run-ins with that lizard-like Creator Race to last me an eternity! Ha! Eternity! Get it? That's a little time travel joke! Oh, nevermind. Point is, it's dangerous back there in the past. I'm not about to risk it myself but if some brave adventurer wanted to go back there for me...~ /*I've had enough run-ins with that lizard-like Creator Race to last me an eternity! Ha! Eternity! Get it? That's a little time travel joke! Oh, nevermind. Point is, it's dangerous back there in the past.*/
@49 = ~Just use the special property of the time crystal and target the effect on the sun dial and you'll be sucked back to a time when these ruins were still being built. When you want to come back, just use the crystal again on the sun dial and you'll be transported back to the present age.~
@50 = ~And if you go back into the past, you might find some way to weaken the guardian golems patrolling this complex so you can get to the Word of Power you told me you were looking for. Or do you tell me at our next meeting? Whatever.~
@51 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@52 = ~Anything else?~
@53 = ~I will leave.~
@54 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. What do you wish to know?~
@55 = ~Tell me about these guardian golems.~
@56 = ~So the Word of Power is inside the ruins?~
@57 = ~Just remember the rules. They're all in that notebook in case you forget. One: the area of the time sink only extends the length of the ruins. You won't be able to leave the vault complex while you are back in the past.~

@59 = ~You could go back into the past and maybe find a way to weaken the golems so you could get to the Word of Power you mentioned at our last meeting... or maybe you mention it at our next meeting. It's hard to keep everything straight.~
@60 = ~Golems?~
@61 = ~How do I use the sun dial?~
@62 = ~You know - the golems. The invulnerable guardians of this complex... didn't we go over this at our next meeting? You could disable them by using the sundial to go into the past.~
@63 = ~I've actually got a notebook that explains it all. It's pretty simple. Here, take the notebook. And these Ultarg tree seeds you promised to plant. Oh, and you'll need this time crystal. The time crystals are magic items with a special use.~
@64 = ~Didn't we already go over this at our next meeting? The vault at the heart of the complex is protected by several golems that are immune to all physical and magical attacks. To beat them you'll have to use the sun dials to go back into the past before the golems were created and find a way to weaken them. That's the only way you'll get to the Word of Power in the center of this vault.~ /*To beat them you'll have to use the sun dials to go back into the past before the golems were created and find a way to weaken them. That's the only way you'll get to the Word of Power in the center of this vault.*/
@65 = ~As far as my research shows. There's a vault at the center of the complex. But you won't get past those guardian golems without using the sun dial to go back to the time of the Creator race.~
@66 = ~They were a brutal people, enslaving the other races with their powerful magic. Physically the Creator Race resemble the lizardfolk of our own time. I have seen them occasionally when using the sun dials to travel to the past.~
@67 = ~Two: you can't bring any items of power from the past back with you. When you come forward they will be left behind. Take only memories and leave only footprints, right? That's a little time travel joke. Get it? Nevermind.~
@68 = ~Okay, I think I got it. Anything else?~
@69 = ~If I can't bring anything back from the past I can't bring back the Word of Power from the vault, can I?~
@70 = ~Remember to plant the Ultarg tree seeds in this spot. Anywhere else and they won't grow. Then come back to the future and speak to me and I'll give you your reward. I guess that's it, unless you have more questions.~
@71 = ~The sun dials will take you to a time before this complex was completed - the Word of Power isn't even in there. Going back into the past won't help you get the Word. Maybe you could find some way to weaken the golems in the past, then come back to the future and defeat them so you could break into the vault. Just a suggestion.~ /*Maybe you could find some way to weaken the golems in the past, then come back to the future and defeat them so you could break into the vault. Just a suggestion.*/
@72 = ~Ah, you are back - or is this our first meeting? Temporal instability in the time stream makes introductions difficult, doesn't it? Is there a problem? Do you need me to refresh your memory of our last meeting - or is that our next meeting?~ [NWSAPP55]
@73 = ~Let's recap what you told me last time.~
@74 = ~I need you to travel into the ancient past to plant the seeds of the Ultarg tree. Plant them in this location in the past so that when the tree bears fruit at the end of its ten thousand year lifespan I can harvest them. Don't worry, I'll see you are well paid for your troubles. I've made a fortune in gambling over the years. Plus, using the sun dial to go back to the age of the Creator Race will send you to a time before the guardian golems were created.~ /*Don't worry, I'll see you are well paid for your troubles. I've made a fortune in gambling over the years. Plus, using the sun dial to go back to the age of the Creator Race will send you to a time before the guardian golems were created.*/
@75 = ~Greetings - once more I must thank you for planting the Ultarg seed trees for me. Or is this the first time I am thanking you? No matter - I am grateful in any case.~ [NWSAPP58]
@76 = ~What about my reward?~
@77 = ~Have I not given it to you yet? No... I suppose I haven't, or you wouldn't be asking now, would you? What to give, what to give? Ah, I know! I think these gems will make a suitable reward. They say they can add sparkle to your personality.~ /*Have I not given it to you yet? No... I suppose I haven't, or you wouldn't be asking now, would you? What to give, what to give? Ah, I know!*/
@78 = ~Thank you, Sapphira. You are most generous.~
@79 = ~I give you a tree that was ten thousand years in the making, and all you give me is a handful of gems?~
@80 = ~You better cough up something else or you'll end up dead at the foot of this tree!~
@81 = ~Farewell, until we meet again for the first time. Ha! Another time travel joke! Or maybe I haven't told any yet...~

@83 = ~Well, I suppose I could afford something else. After all, you did risk capture by those scaly slavers in the past to plant this tree for me. I don't have much else on me, except for this scroll. You can have it, I suppose. There's nothing else I can give you.~ /*Well, I suppose I could afford something else. After all, you did risk capture by those scaly slavers in the past to plant this tree for me.*/
@84 = ~True enough but those gems were a thousand centuries in the making, weren't they? I think we are even.~
@85 = ~Obviously you have no concept of existence across multiple temporal realities. As long as I remain in this place and this time period I am eternal and, in effect, immortal. You can't hurt me, so your threats have no meaning.~
@86 = ~Oh, hello - I didn't see you there. I was too busy studying this amazing tree. Remarkable, isn't it? Ten thousand years to produce a single fruit, and then it dies.~ [NWSAPP57]
@87 = ~Only a few more days until the Ultarg fruit blossoms, and I can't afford to miss my chance. Lucky for me I found someone willing to slip through the time stream and plant these seeds for me.~
