@0 = ~NP: Residents of Port Llast are afraid to go out at night. They say that werewolves have started up in the city and attack people at night. Whom the werewolf bites - he also becomes a werewolf.~ /*I wouldn't go into Luskan, if I were you. I hear they're rounding up everyone of <RACE> blood and putting them in prison.*/
@1 = ~NP: They say the gates to Luskan are closed and no one is allowed in. The local captains cannot divide power between themselves in any way, they staged a real war among themselves.~ /*It was thought the plague could be contained there, but even as we try to calm people, the Wailing follows soon after.*/
@2 = ~NP: We have a ranger in Port Llast, his name is Ballard. So he claims that something wrong happened in the Neverwinter forest, it seems like the animals attack everyone in a row, they just became mad.~ /*It's just that there is this ranger, Ballard, who was talking about it here the other day. He seemed to be quite disturbed.*/
@3 = ~NP: Shaldrissa, the daughter of our mayor, is completely conceited, she does not talk to local guys, she is always looking for the prince. And her daddy seems to have no time for her, he catches escaped criminals.~ /*Perhaps not, but I've no desire to speak to some perfumed fool. Go question the orc in the next room and leave me be.*/
@4 = ~NP: Some kind of evil cult has settled somewhere near us. They say that Lady Aribeth herself came to catch them.~ /*Hmm. There be a temple to Tyr close by. Not sure if the priests yet live, however.*/
@5 = ~NP: We've had a merchant ship in the port for two days now and nothing is being loaded onto it. They say that the captain and the head of the port have some kind of dispute, they canâ€™t agree in any way.~ /*He'd never beat me, but then, no one can. That's why I put the bar up as a reward. People stopped trying.*/
@6 = ~NP: There hasn't been any news from Charwood for a long time. There are rumors that there are now full of undead, some ghosts have appeared, just horror!~ /*Chief of goblin sees you. What you want now? You gots news for us?*/
@7 = ~NP: Vaneve, the magician here has an excellent house in Port Llast, but he does not live in it himself. People said that he built himself a tower near the southern road.~ /*I imagine they sell supplies at the Board Laid Bare, but I have not been there myself. It is by the south gate.*/
