@0 = ~Ah, a worthy opponent! Greetings, I am Stirge the baby-killer, recently escaped from hard time in Waterdeep! My four fellow prisoners and I are now among the most wanted criminals along the Sword Coast.~
@1 = ~A baby killer? In that case, I'll have to kill you.~
@2 = ~Stirge? You're one of the escaped criminals with a huge bounty on his head!~
@3 = ~Why would you tell this to a stranger?~
@4 = ~NP: Not so fast! After all, what you want is not my death, but rather proof of death. If you've read the bounty announcements all over the Sword Coast, you'll know that my branded ear alone can bear witness. If you save my life and listen to what I tell you, I will cut off the ear from my own head and give it to you as proof.~ /*Not so fast! After all, it isn't my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties posted the length of the Sword Coast, you'd know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof.*/
@5 = ~NP: If that wasn't enough, I'll be happy to tell you where to find some other escaped prisoners as well. They are scoundrels like me, and the reward for them is the same. Come on, listen to what I'm going to tell you. Of course, you're curious to know how I, Stirge, the killer of children, escaped from the most secure prison in Waterdeep.~ /*If that were not enough, I'd also be willing to tell you where to find some of other escaped prisoners. They are as dastardly as I, and are worth the same reward. Come now; listen to what I have to say.*/
@6 = ~All right, how did you get out?~
@7 = ~I'm done talking to a baby killer. Defend yourself!~
@8 = ~You are correct my friend. I am one of the only living beings to have escaped Waterdeep's most secure prison. But before you do anything rash, please hear me out.~
@9 = ~NP: Why should I listen to this, dwarf?~ /*Why should I listen, gnome?*/
@10 = ~Why shouldn't I tell you? It's important that you realize I'm not some simple farmer bumbling about a rotted out tree stump! I am Stirge the baby killer!~
@11 = ~NP: I was just about to tell you about it. I was glad to see a spark of impatience that slipped in the air between your ears. I ended up in jail, which was very inopportune. I wanted to get out so I could get back to doing what I do best. I discovered that escaping from Waterdeep prison was considered impossible, and realized that I would need help to accomplish the impossible.~ /*I realized that escaping this Waterdhavian prison was said to be impossible, so I knew I would need help achieving the impossible.*/
@12 = ~So you went to the other inmates?~
@13 = ~Really? How quaint!~
@14 = ~NP: ABOUT,<GIRLBOY> I have a reason for everything. In the end, you do not need my death, but only its evidence. Anyone who has carefully read the advertisements for the award knows that they only want my tattooed ear as proof. If you save my life and listen to what I tell you, I will cut off the ear from my own head and give it to you as proof.~ /*My good <PRO_GIRLBOY>, I have a reason for everything. After all, it isn't my death that you want, but rather the proof of my death. If you had read the bounties closely my friend, you'd know that you need only my tattooed ear as proof.*/
@15 = ~NP: Yes, that is right. Well, aren't you smart? Someone definitely got off the wrong foot today! So, that's right, I established a relationship with Zor, Delilah, Wyvern and Ezgar. I knew that they were all interested in escaping and, unlike the others, had the necessary talents.~ /*Yes, indeed. Aren't we a quick study? Someone woke up refreshed this day! So yes, I worked out a relationship with Zor, Delilah, Wyvern, and Yesgar.*/
@16 = ~What kind of talent?~
@17 = ~NP: The only talents you need! The ones that work together. Zor was a healthy beast! He could topple the gate or break through the door! Delilah's poisons helped incapacitate many of the guards in the prison. And Wyvern was able to summon the animals that helped us escape. He used them to send messages, create distractions, and even throw the guards off our trail. It was so exciting!~ /*The only kind of talent! The kind that works together. Zor was a big brute! He could pull down gates or smash through doors!*/
@18 = ~NP: What was your role in the escape?~ /*What your role in escape?*/
@19 = ~Me? I helped to put it all together. Mine were the brains that put the plan together, and got us all working in unison... Well, me and Yesgar but he's just the figurehead, there to inspire loyalty.~
@20 = ~You still trying to escape. No success yet?~
@21 = ~Oh, but it has! No one ever escaped from that prison! We were the first. We made it out the door. We can get caught now, after the fact, but it doesn't change anything. We escaped.~
@22 = ~NP: So what's next?~ /*"To what end?"*/
@23 = ~NP: Now we will play a game. If you beat me, I'll cut off my ear and give it to you, because you only need one, don't you? You will receive the reward for my ear. The game we're going to fight is the oldest game in the world. I call you a word, and you need to answer it with another word that can defeat mine, but is not its opposite.~ /*The game we'll play is the oldest game of all. I will give you a word and you must respond to it with another word that can defeat the original without being its opposite.*/
@24 = ~If you win I'll tell you where Delilah is and give you my valuable ear. If not we will settle this with blades.~
@25 = ~All right, let's play.~
@26 = ~Can you give me an example of how to play?~

@49 = ~Summer.~
@50 = ~Lightning.~
@51 = ~Rain.~
@52 = ~Sea.~

Okay, let me tell you about Delilah and cut off that pesky ear that I can buy my life with.~ /*Come, let me tell you of Delilah, then, and tear off this offending ear that I might buy my life.*/
@87 = ~NP: Quick, get your ear over here, dwarf!~ /*Hurry up and give your ear gnome!*/

@96 = ~NP: Ah, how wise. Only with the help of grief can tragedy be overcome and reborn to a new life. Alas, I do not know what could overcome grief. I guess you won the day. Okay, let me tell you about Delilah and cut off that pesky ear that I can buy my life with.~ /*Come, let me tell you of Delilah, then, and tear off this offending ear that I might buy my life.*/
