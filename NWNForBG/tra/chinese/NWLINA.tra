@0 = ~Please <SIRMAAM>, I already told you that I didn't mean to step on your cat, it ran right in front... oh, you're not <HIMHER>. Oh goodness, how embarrassing. Why does this always happen to me?~ [NWLIN051] 
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I'm not in the mood to chat right now. Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Um, before I tell you anything about me, I would like to ask you a question, if you don't mind. You're not one of those dirty, underhanded, conniving thief types, are you?~ 
@4 = ~I don't like the rest of the description, but I am a thief, yes.~
@5 = ~That would pretty much sum me up, yes.~
@6 = ~Uh, no.~
@7 = ~Sounds like you have something against thieves.~
@8 = ~No, I'm not. Why do you ask?~
@9 = ~If that is how you feel, <SIRMAAM>. Should you need someone who can heal your injuries and fight alongside you, please return.~
@10 = ~Oh, but not the kind who would steal the gold fillings from your grandmother's teeth while she's still talking.~
@11 = ~No.~
@12 = ~She just doesn't need them!~
@13 = ~Hm. Something tells me you're not being completely honest. Still, you don't look like a truly evil kind of thief. I have had nothing but problems with irritating, despisable thieves, ever since I left... but that's not important right now. Let me introduce myself.~ 
@14 = ~Okay.~
@15 = ~No, tell me what happened.~
@16 = ~Oh, well, okay. Even if you were, I guess you don't look like a truly evil person. I have had nothing but problems with irritating, despisable thieves, ever since I left... but that's not important right now. Let me introduce myself.~ 
@17 = ~That doesn't answer my question.~
@18 = ~I have had nothing but problems with irritating, despisable thieves, ever since I left... but that's not important right now. Let me introduce myself.~
@19 = ~Oh my! Well, not the kind of thief that would set a mother on fire, just to steal her baby's rattle?~
@20 = ~Well, if it looked like it was actually worth something, maybe.~
@21 = ~My gods woman! What kind of thieves have you run into?~
@22 = ~My name is Linu La'neral, a devout priest of Sehanine Moonbow. I seek to continue my adventures by hiring myself out as a healer.~
@23 = ~I don't think I've ever heard of Sehanine Moonbow.~
@24 = ~Who be Sehameme Moonbutt?~
@25 = ~Why are you here in the barracks, rather than helping the plague victims?~
@26 = ~Not right now, but thanks for asking, dear. My name is Linu La'neral, a devout priest of Sehanine Moonbow. I seek to continue my adventures by hiring myself out as a healer.~ 
@27 = ~Oh, you're just playing with me! You shouldn't toy with people like that, I almost believed you. I have had nothing but problems with irritating, despisable thieves, ever since I left... but that's not important right now. Let me introduce myself.~ 
@28 = ~You may not know the Goddess, but I can tell you are a <MANWOMAN> of faith. Sehanine is the elven deity of mysticism, journeys, dreams, death, and other domains. She protects her people, sometimes sending dreams or visions to guide us. I came to this city believing that I could stem the tide of this plague with the powers of Sehanine. Alas, it defied my every attempt to find a cure.~ 
@29 = ~Few outside the elven people know of Sehanine. There is little to tell that would be of importance to you, except that she protects her people, sometimes sending dreams or visions to guide us. I came to this city believing that I could stem the tide of this plague with the powers of Sehanine. Alas, it defied my every attempt to find a cure.~ 
@30 = ~Sehanine Moonbow. I suppose she has been called worse, though usually on purpose.~
@31 = ~I came to this city believing that I could stem the tide of this plague with the powers of Sehanine. Alas, it defied my every attempt to find a cure.~
@32 = ~I worked long, hard hours in the temple of Tyr, trying to alleviate the pain of the sick. Finally, after working through several days and nights, I was exhausted. When I tried to stand, I fainted.~
@33 = ~What happen next?~
@34 = ~Well, I fell over and bumped into a glass statue of the symbol of Tyr. One of the balanced plates flew across the room and smashed spectacularly right above the head of the high priest. The crash was so shocking that the priest sat down, right on top of a rather large shard of glass. I'm sure it healed up just fine, once they stripped him and pulled it out.~ 
@35 = ~I was unhurt, but the other priests didn't seem too concerned about that at the time. They asked me to find somewhere else to help with the wounded; as if it was my fault somehow.~
@36 = ~Well, that could happen to anyone.~
@37 = ~Are you really that clumsy?~
@38 = ~Just what I need, a cleric that's tripping and knocking things over every few minutes.~
@39 = ~You are kind to say so, but I suppose it didn't help that I had accidentally lit the altar on fire the previous day.~
@40 = ~I'm not really clumsy; I was just tired. My troubles don't come from a lack of dexterity, so much as poor timing. Don't worry, I'm good in a fight and an excellent healer. Each day I have been assisting victims of the plague in the slums in the Blacklake district, where they lie in the street, ignored by the residents and guards alike.~ 
@41 = ~That's good of you.~
@42 = ~Then why are you here?~
@43 = ~I'm looking for a good healer to help me in my mission.~
@44 = ~I've heard enough. You're dangerous to be around. Goodbye and better luck to you.~
@45 = ~Well, not anymore. (Sigh) The last time I visited there was a couple of days ago. I was attempting to help a sick, old woman off the street when I was set upon by several thugs.~
@46 = ~They attacked you while you were helping plague victims?~
@47 = ~Sounds typical for your luck.~
@48 = ~I want to trust you and I need the work, but I really don't care to be involved in any shady deals. Perhaps you could tell me more about this mission?~
@49 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. I must find several missing creatures that might be used to find a plague cure.~
@50 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@51 = ~Oh, I didn't mean to scare you off. I really am a very good healer. Come back if you would like to hire my services.~
@52 = ~People are terribly discouraged, because they figure they are going to catch the Wailing Death, so they aren't overly concerned with morals. In their desperation they turn to theft, or worse. I want to go back and help, but what can I do? I think that if I could earn some more experience, and maybe some gold, I might be able to make a difference.~ 
@53 = ~Do you know anything else about the Blacklake district?~
@54 = ~Well, yes, but I'm hardly the only person who's been attacked there. People are terribly discouraged, because they figure they are going to catch the Wailing Death, so they aren't overly concerned with morals. In their desperation they turn to theft, or worse. I want to go back and help, but what can I do? I think that if I could earn some more experience, and maybe some gold, I might be able to make a difference.~ 
@55 = ~Aribeth has worked hard to combat this plague, so I am sure I can trust her instincts in this matter. I would love to work for you, if we can agree upon a fair price for my services. Only 800 gold pieces and you will gain the talents of one who can heal and fight.~
@56 = ~I could use a good healer. Here's your 800 gold. Welcome aboard, Linu.~
@57 = ~That seems a little expensive. I'll give you 600.~
@58 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@59 = ~I'll be going now.~
@60 = ~I can understand that. If you are working for Aribeth then I am certain your 'mission' must be of great importance. Aribeth has worked hard to combat this plague, so I am sure I can trust her instincts in this matter. I would love to work for you, if we can agree upon a fair price for my services. Only 800 gold pieces and you will gain the talents of one who can heal and fight.~
@61 = ~Some of the rich nobles have collected exotic animals and made a zoo, for their entertainment. The conditions of the zoo are supposed to be disgusting and the animals have been mistreated. I should have done something about it, but the sick and dying in this city are enough misery for anyone. I heard there is a druid here in the core who is looking for someone to help free the animals.~ 
@62 = ~You will not regret this, dear <CHARNAME>. My skills are yours to command. I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.~
@63 = ~I guess I must not let my own greed get in the way. 600 is fair; all my skills are yours to command. I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.~
@64 = ~I'm sorry. 800 is my final offer. Consider the cost of repeated journeys to a temple for healing.~
@65 = ~Ah well, maybe in time you will earn the funds and can return. I just hope you don't have to spend it all on healing from the temples.~
@66 = ~Goddess speed your journey and keep you safe. If you have need of my skills, I shall be here, unless someone else hires me.~
@67 = ~If you want to go to the Blacklake district you will have to cross the slums. Plenty of looters would like to stick a knife in you, so having someone who can guard your back and heal your wounds is a good idea.~
@68 = ~What I need is someone to assist me on a mission.~
@69 = ~No, thank you. Goodbye and better luck to you.~
@70 = ~Welcome back to the Trade of Blades, dear. What brings you here this time?~ [NWLIN052]
@71 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@72 = ~I'm looking for a good healer to help me in my mission.~
@73 = ~Who are you again?~
@74 = ~Nothing, just passing through.~
@75 = ~I can't really tell you a lot about the city. I have spent most of my time helping ease the suffering of the plague victims. I do have some knowledge of the Blacklake district, as I focused my attentions in the slums of that area. Before you get to the rich part of that area you have to cross the dangerous section. That's where I was attacked while trying to assist the sick.~ 
@76 = ~<CHARNAME>! I had hoped that you would show up here, my friend. I heard that Aribeth recruited you to stamp out the evil cult that was responsible for the plague.~ [NWLIN053]
@77 = ~Linu, what a pleasant surprise.~
@78 = ~I thought we parted ways. Why have you followed me?~
@79 = ~Goodbye.~
@80 = ~I thought we had parted for good, <CHARNAME>, but the goddess has her own plans that I must follow. I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ 
@81 = ~You certainly know how to flatter yourself, <CHARNAME>, but I did not follow you here. I have my own goals and reasons for needing to be here. I went back to the Trade of Blades to prepare myself for a journey home. I was only there a few hours when I was approached by Lady Aribeth on behalf of Lord Nasher himself.~ 
@82 = ~If you find yourself spending a lot of time with the temple healers, you might want to come back here and hire me. Good luck.~
@83 = ~She told me that Lord Nasher is determined to root out the cult that brought so much suffering to his city. He has ordered all the mercenaries in Neverwinter to come to Port Llast to join in the search. I was afraid I might have missed you while I was changing my clothes.~ 
@84 = ~Changing your clothes?~
@85 = ~I want you to join me again.~
@86 = ~Oh, when I came the local tavern a waitress spilled some drinks.~
@87 = ~She soaked your clothes?~
@88 = ~Did you get mad at her?~
@89 = ~Oh, <CHARNAME>, I'm so excited to be on another adventure with you. I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.~ 
@90 = ~Well... no. I bumped into her and when the drinks crashed down I leapt backwards into a dwarf, knocking over his ale and stew.~
@91 = ~So that messed you up?~
@92 = ~I think I'm getting the picture.~
@93 = ~Um, no, the food and drinks landed on the floor, but the dwarf crashed into a half-orc, causing the knife he was eating with to slice open his cheek. That's when the brawl started.~
@94 = ~And you wrecked your outfit in the brawl?~
@95 = ~Disaster follows you, doesn't it?~
@96 = ~I managed to stay out of the brawl, hiding under a table and feeling awfully guilty. When the fight was over I felt I should help clean up the mess.~
@97 = ~So you got dirty cleaning up?~
@98 = ~Please tell me that's how you got dirty.~
@99 = ~No, I wore an apron and managed to stay pretty clean. Then I stepped outside for a breath of fresh air and slipped in a mud puddle. So then I had to go change.~
@100 = ~Why didn't you just tell me you slipped in a puddle from the start?~
@101 = ~I think I'll go somewhere else now. Maybe to a nice safe dragon lair.~
@102 = ~I... I didn't want you to think I was clumsy. I'm waiting here at the orders of Lady Aribeth.~ 
@103 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@104 = ~I often am in need of a skilled healer. Join me.~
@105 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@106 = ~Oh, please don't leave now. I didn't want to frighten you away.~
@107 = ~Lord Nasher ordered all mercenaries to come to Port Llast to help discover the whereabouts of the cult that nearly destroyed his city.~
@108 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@109 = ~If you want to bring them to justice, why are you waiting in here?~
@110 = ~It would be a great pleasure, <CHARNAME>. I look forward to our adventures together. I will follow you and perform to the best of my abilities, according to the orders you have given me.~ 
@111 = ~I haven't heard anything specific about the cult, but I have heard about some trouble around Neverwinter Wood. I don't know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.~ 
@112 = ~I'm not much of an investigator. I have been ordered to travel with anyone who has need of a healer. You are the one who knows how to solve mysteries, <CHARNAME>. I would love to help you though. I have strong abilities in the art of healing, and I also can stand on my own in a fight. I would be a valuable resource for your quest.~ 
@113 = ~Having failed to destroy us with their terrible disease, it would hardly shock me to find out that the cult had struck with a plague of vicious animals. Is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~
@114 = ~Are you planning to travel there?~
@115 = ~Why are you waiting around in here? Should you be investigating the problem?~
@116 = ~Greetings and well met. You saved the city of Neverwinter. I heard the tales of your deeds as they were sung by a bard. It's wonderful to meet you in person.~ [NWLIN054]
@117 = ~A bard? But I didn't do that much. Everyone working for Aribeth helped.~
@118 = ~Bards are singing about me? Excellent.~
@119 = ~Modesty is a true sign of a heroic nature. I think that the bards will sing more than one song about your deeds someday.~
@120 = ~I am Linu La'neral, an elven priestess of Sehanine Moonbow. I was hoping to meet you, but I figured I missed you while I was changing my clothes.~
@121 = ~Hello again, <CHARNAME>. I do hope you remember me. I'm Linu La'neral, cleric of Sehanine Moonblade. I'm just waiting here so I can help someone bring those evil plague spreaders to justice.~ [NWLIN055]
