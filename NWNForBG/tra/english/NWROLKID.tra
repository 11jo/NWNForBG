@0 = ~Hmmm... I don't recognize you, and I thought I knew all the new recruits who've joined the Lords' Alliance.~ [NWROLK60]
@1 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I work for Aarin Gend.~
@2 = ~My name is none of your business!~
@3 = ~<CHARNAME>? The same <CHARNAME> who saved Neverwinter from the plague? We could use a good <MANWOMAN> like you up on the battle front. It's too bad Gend has you working on something else. You must have come in here to purchase some equipment, right? So, what can I interest you in? A good sword? A stout shield, perhaps? Or was there something else?~ /*<CHARNAME>? The same <CHARNAME> who saved Neverwinter from the plague? We could use a good <MANWOMAN> like you up on the battle front.*/
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~I'd like to see your inventory.~
@6 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@7 = ~I'll be going now.~
@8 = ~So that's the attitude you want to take, is it? Your name doesn't really matter to me anyway. I was just trying to be friendly... My orders are to make sure everyone has the supplies they need, even a jerk like you... So, what can I interest you in? A good sword? A stout shield, perhaps? Or was there something else?~
@9 = ~You're kidding, right? Everybody knows me! I'm Rolkid of the Mighty Lance! I'm probably the most famous gnome knight of Neverwinter! Aarin Gend's put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he's too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!~ /*Aarin Gend's put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he's too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!*/
@10 = ~Well, that's what I'm here for: armor and weapons for sale at reasonable prices. Take a look and see if there's anything you like.~
@11 = ~Truth is, I don't have time to play information clerk. I'm too busy trying to run a war here. Aarin Gend's put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he's too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!~ /*Aarin Gend's put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he's too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!*/
@12 = ~Feel free to come on back if you ever need anything in the way of martial supplies. The more armed soldiers we get into the field, the better our chances of defeating those Luskan dogs!~
@13 = ~Normally I wouldn't complain, but this isn't exactly what I signed on for. We can't fight a war with no supplies!~
@14 = ~No supplies? What are you talking about?~
@15 = ~It was bad enough when those bloody Orc bandits were cutting off our supply lines, but now that they're gone my job isn't getting any easier. Rumor is King Obould Many-Arrows is forming an alliance with Luskan. If they combine forces we won't stand a chance, no matter how many soldiers and swords I send to the front lines.~ /*Rumor is King Obould Many-Arrows is forming an alliance with Luskan. If they combine forces we won't stand a chance, no matter how many soldiers and swords I send to the front lines.*/
@16 = ~King Obould Many-Arrows? Who's that?~
@17 = ~I have the head of King Obould Many-Arrows.~
@18 = ~I guess I shouldn't complain. Everyone has to do their part. But you didn't come to listen to me grumble. Do you need some supplies, or was there something else?~
@19 = ~It's those blasted Orcish raiders. Every time we get a new supply line set up to the battle front, those damn bandits cut it off! An army's no good if they don't have a steady stream of supplies replenishing their stores. I tell you, if this keeps up we might as well surrender to Luskan right now!~ /*An army's no good if they don't have a steady stream of supplies replenishing their stores. I tell you, if this keeps up we might as well surrender to Luskan right now!*/
@20 = ~Maybe I could help you.~
@21 = ~King Obould Many-Arrows is probably the most powerful Orc Chieftain in the entire North. According to a couple of those spies Aarin Gend lent me Obould has arranged a parlay with the Luskan commanders. Dealing with Orcish bandits is one thing, but Obould's tribe is a massive, highly efficient army. If he forms an alliance with Luskan, Neverwinter could be in real trouble.~ /*King Obould Many-Arrows is probably the most powerful Orc Chieftain in the entire North. According to a couple of those spies Aarin Gend lent me Obould has arranged a parlay with the Luskan commanders.*/
@22 = ~So what do you want me to do?~
@23 = ~Wow, Obould's even uglier than I imagined. The flies eating out his eyes probably don't help. No matter, I've got a stake all sharpened up and waiting for this one. Here's the 1000 gold pieces I promised. With Obould and his followers out of the picture, maybe we can actually start winning this war.~ /*Wow, Obould's even uglier than I imagined. The flies eating out his eyes probably don't help. No matter, I've got a stake all sharpened up and waiting for this one.*/

@25 = ~Hey, I'll welcome any help I can get. I've already put out a bounty on the heads of the two most famous Orc bandits in the region: Vaath and Guzud. I figure if they both get taken out, the rest of the thieving scum will get the message and back off. I'm offering 500 gold pieces for each of them, payable upon delivery of their decapitated head.~ /*Hey, I'll welcome any help I can get. I've already put out a bounty on the heads of the two most famous Orc bandits in the region: Vaath and Guzud.*/
@26 = ~I'll be back to collect those bounties!~
@27 = ~Any idea where I could start looking for those bandits?~
@28 = ~I have the heads of Guzud and Vaath.~
@29 = ~I want you to bring me Obould's head on a platter! That should trigger a brutal power struggle as Obould's generals try to take the place of their fallen king. It'll keep them orcs busy for a few years, and out of our hair.~
@30 = ~Good luck. It won't be easy to find those bandit hideouts. Vaath and Guzud have both been in business for years and no one's tracked them down yet. Take this writ, though. It identifies you as a bounty hunter under my authority.~

@32 = ~You could try looking in the Coldwood to the northeast; that place has always had its share of bandits. And there were some reports of bandits around Fort Ilkard to the south. Other than that I couldn't say. Finding them's the hard part. Well, that and killing them.~ /*You could try looking in the Coldwood to the northeast; that place has always had its share of bandits. And there were some reports of bandits around Fort Ilkard to the south.*/
@33 = ~Well, I guess Vaath won't be cutting off our supply lines anymore! I think I'm going to mount his head on a stake right outside the barracks... it's good for morale and all. Here's the bounty for that bandit: 500 gold pieces, just like I promised. It's going to be a relief knowing our supply lines are safe with Vaath and Guzud out of the way.~ /*Well, I guess Vaath won't be cutting off our supply lines anymore! I think I'm going to mount his head on a stake right outside the barracks... it's good for morale and all.*/

@35 = ~Only problem is, no one knows where or when this meeting is supposed to happen. King Obould must be somewhere in the area, probably hiding out with his honor guard in some stink-ridden cave. Find Obould's lair and kill him. Bring me his head and I'll give you 1000 gold pieces. Let's see those Luskan dogs try to form an alliance with him then!~ /*Only problem is, no one knows where or when this meeting is supposed to happen. King Obould must be somewhere in the area, probably hiding out with his honor guard in some stink-ridden cave.*/
@36 = ~The heads of the orcish bandits Vaath and Guzud adorn the twin stakes flanking the entrance to the soldiers barracks in Beournna's Well. The infamous raiders will trouble the supply lines of the Lords' Alliance no more.
Rolkid now seeks the head of Obould Many-Arrows, a powerful orcish chieftain, to complete his collection. Needless to say, he has put up a substantial reward.~
@37 = ~Do you have orc heads for me? Or do you need my help?~
@38 = ~Back again, <CHARNAME>? You need to buy some equipment, or is there something else I can do for you?~ [NWROLK58]
@39 = ~Welcome back. How's the life of the bounty hunter treating you? You bring any orc heads back for me? Or is there something else I can do for you?~ [NWROLK59]
@40 = ~Hello, again. If you've come to me looking for work, you're out of luck. With Guzud, Vaath and Obould all out of the picture I'm not handing out anymore bounties. Or was there something else you needed?~
