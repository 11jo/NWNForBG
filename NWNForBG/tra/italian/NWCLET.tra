@0 = ~Huh? What? Oh - you startled me. I was rather engrossed in these manuscripts Master Ford has me looking over. Fascinating reading. These documents date from the time of the Creator Race, if you can believe that! Hopefully they'll give us some insight into the Source Stone we unearthed.~ 
@1 = ~I need to see the Source Stone.~
@2 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Yes, well - you'll have to speak to Master Ford about that. Now, is there something else or can I get back to my parchments and tomes?~
@5 = ~(sigh) Master Ford always harps upon the value of sharing our knowledge with others, so I suppose I should answer your questions.~
@6 = ~Who are you?~
@7 = ~Who is Master Ford and where can I find him?~
@8 = ~What do you know about the Source Stone?~
@9 = ~Where are the Words of Power?~
@10 = ~You should go speak to Master Ford. Maybe you can talk some sense into him and get him to give this all up.~
@11 = ~I am Cletus, if you must know. Master Ford's most promising student. He even told me so himself.~
@12 = ~Master Ford is only the most famous archeologist in all of Neverwinter! He's spent the better part of fifty years unearthing items of great historical significance! But he's never unearthed anything like this before. I'm honored he chose me to help him uncover the secrets of the Source Stone! That's him, over there by the door.~ 
@13 = ~The stone contains immense power and radiates a widespread but gentle warmth throughout the whole city. That's the reason it's never winter in Neverwinter. Other than this we *know* very little. But Master Ford has several interesting theories. You should speak to him about them.~ 
@14 = ~They're with the Source Stone, of course. Master Ford feels their power is the key to unlocking the secrets within. Perhaps you should speak to him about this.~
