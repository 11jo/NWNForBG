@0 = ~A good <DAYNIGHTALL> for field work, wouldn't you say, m'<LADYLORD>?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I suppose you could. What is it you want to know, m'<LADYLORD>?~
@4 = ~I'm curious about some recent events...~
@5 = ~Anything interesting about these parts?~
@6 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@7 = ~Safe journeys, then. I'll be here in the fields if you ever feel like stopping by to chat.~
@8 = ~Aye, that seems a reasonable enough thing to ask after.~
@9 = ~That cult preying on Neverwinter - know anything about it?~
@10 = ~Actually I'm more interested in local affairs...~
@11 = ~How long have you farmed here?~
@12 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@13 = ~Oh, my father-in-law told me a few old tales from when he first cleared the land to settle here.~
@14 = ~Tell me one of your father-in-law's stories.~
@15 = ~Actually, I'm more interested in a job, if you know of anything.~
@16 = ~Are there any places you think I should visit?~
@17 = ~I would like to ask another question.~
@18 = ~Very well but mind that I've still got work that needs doing...~
@19 = ~Where does the north road lead?~
@20 = ~Where does the east road lead?~
@21 = ~Is there a place where I might rest nearby?~
@22 = ~Hrmm... A week ago or so, my son said he met a seedy looking fellow heading into the Charwood. My son said hello and the man said some rude things. He's as good as gone, then, I suppose...~
@23 = ~So what's so special about it?~
@24 = ~Did anything else stand out about him?~
@25 = ~Other than Pete O'Deel's trouble with the wolves, it's been pretty quiet around these parts. Grass grows, wind blows, nothing much of consequence... You've still got more questions, don't you... I can tell.~
@26 = ~Who is Pete O'Deel?~
@27 = ~Trouble with wolves?~
@28 = ~Since I was a young man, I suppose. The farm came with the wife, bless her soul. Her parents homesteaded the place, but that's a story in itself...~
@29 = ~A story, is it? I'd love to hear it...~
@30 = ~What do you want to know?~
@31 = ~See where the field stops and the woods begin? My father-in-law said to... never... Oh, now of all the stories, what possessed me to tell this one?~
@32 = ~Tell me. It's not a big deal.~
@33 = ~Now that my boy's cheered up a little and finally off to market, things are pretty good around here. Maybe wander by Pete O'Deel's up on the south bluff, there. They're friendly enough folk and wouldn't mind hearing the latest news from town. Their girl, Constance, she's a nice lass.~ /*Maybe wander by Pete O'Deel's up on the south bluff, there. They're friendly enough folk and wouldn't mind hearing the latest news from town. Their girl, Constance, she's a nice lass.*/
@34 = ~Well, other than cheering up my boy Erik, I'm not sure what you could do. Seems that O'Deel lass has broken his heart just like I said. He's locked himself in his room, "to think", he says,and I'm getting a little tired of doing his chores in the meantime. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*Well, other than cheering up my boy Erik, I'm not sure what you could do. Seems that O'Deel lass has broken his heart just like I said.*/
@35 = ~Maybe wander by Pete O'Deel's there. They're friendly enough folk and wouldn't mind hearing the latest news from town. Their girl, Constance, she's a nice lass.~
@36 = ~That way? Take it long enough and you'll make it all the way to Port Llast. Most of the ruts along the way are mine, at least come harvest. And if take it long enough you can get to Luskan, but that's a long way for me.~ /**/
@37 = ~Well, now, that heads into the Charwood. Take my advice, though, you're better off thinking of my farm as the end of the road.~
@38 = ~How come?~
@39 = ~Well now, I'd offer you my place but my son's grown to the point where there's not the same room that there used to be. Oh well, we'll fit in somehow.~
@40 = ~It's nothing but devil's business in there, mark my word, <GIRLBOY>. That forest is haunted so people who know generally steer clear.~
@41 = ~Other than the fact that no one travels to Charwood, no. That forest is haunted so people who know generally steer clear.~
@42 = ~Pete is the farmer across the way. Mary and my wife were best friends from birth 'til the day she passed away. I've known the O'Deels since we first started courting. They're good folk. Pete's farm's been beset by wolves, lately.~
@43 = ~Just east of here, Pete O'Deel has a farm with a few head of cattle. A pack of wolves has been killing his cattle almost daily.~ /**/
@44 = ~Well if you start a story, you'd better finish it, they say... The trees beyond that line, that's Charwood territory and no place for the living... You can cut down a hundred of those trees but, when you wake up the next morning, they'll all be standing again like they'd never known the blade. Something about those woods don't take well to change. Word is there's a village of lost souls in there somewhere and people who go there never leave...~
@45 = ~My father-in-law warned me never to go in there and I've told my boy the same. You'd be wise to do likewise... Now is there anything else?~
@46 = ~Out for a jaunt, are you, <SIRMAAM>?~
@47 = ~Mind you don't trample the corn, now. How can I be of service to you?~ /**/
