@0 = ~What do you want? I ain't looking for a fight, friend, so please don't hurt me.~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~If that will get you to leave without hurting me, I will answer what I can.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about the Beggar's Nest.~
@5 = ~What do you know about all the zombies?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~I need to talk to you about gold.~
@8 = ~Goodbye. Please, leave me in peace.~
@9 = ~That's it? Couldn't you just... wander around, or something? What do you need to know?~
@10 = ~Has the effect of the plague been bad here?~
@11 = ~Are there any safe places?~
@12 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@13 = ~I know they are gone, and that's enough for me. I don't care who or what got rid of them, but I'm grateful.~
@14 = ~I wanted to ask about the Beggar's Nest.~
@15 = ~I don't want to know anything about any walking dead. That is just... it's not right!~
@16 = ~When did they first start showing up?~
@17 = ~What do you want me to say? I haven't seen much of anything. I've been boarded up in here, trying not to get the plague.~
@18 = ~I have an answer for you before you say another word. I have none. I have already been robbed blind, thank you very much. Have you any other questions, or will you be leaving now?~
@19 = ~Can you tell me anything about the zombies?~
@20 = ~I mean, at least the zombies seem to have gone away, but the plague is still there... I can't see it, but I know it's there.~
@21 = ~Now there's dead people walking around. Dead people! What is someone like me supposed to do about that?~
@22 = ~Anything strange besides the plague and undead then?~
@23 = ~MT: How can you ask about it? What kind of life do you have if pestilence and the living dead no longer seem strange enough to you? A kind of plague-ridden undead - a clogged city, that's where you live.<HESHE> asks me what else is unusual here besides pestilence and undead... yeah.~ /*Some sort of plague-y undead-walky town, that's where you live. <PRO_HESHE> asks me what's strange besides plague and undead... yeesh.*/
@24 = ~MT: Anything out of the ordinary *other than* pestilence and undead? To be honest, I don't think about it that often, but...maybe... There are a lot of strange people in the Beggars' Nest. And just embittered - also enough. There is a gang that has always caused problems. And also a cult.~ /*The Beggar's Nest has its share of strange people. Just plain mean ones too. There's a gang that's always been a problem. And a cult.*/
@25 = ~What do you know about the gang?~
@26 = ~What do you know about the cult?~
@27 = ~MT: They call themselves the Sword Coast Boys. Mostly they are petty thieves. There are almost no really cool guys... Except maybe this guy named Drol. He is their leader, but as far as I understand, they could all have died from pestilence by now. They used to gather in the northern part of the Nest, I think.~ /*They call themselves the Sword Coast Boys. Copperthieves, mostly. No real troublemakers... except maybe for that Drawl guy.*/
@28 = ~MT: Nothing, and I don't want to know anything. Seems like a group of Siric worshipers. There is not a single normal person among them. I don't know what pestilence did to them. But I think if they are no more, I will not cry.~ /*Nothing, and I don't want to know anything. Bunch of Cyric worshippers, I think. Not a sane one in the bunch.*/
@29 = ~What do you want? You've the look of a bandit to you, so... uh... please don't hurt me.~
