@0 = ~Hi there. You nice? You look nice. Momma says lots people aren't nice. Maybe even downstairs.~
@1 = ~What's downstairs? Is there something in your house?~
@2 = ~You shouldn't be outside. It's dangerous.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Yeah, there's something behind the bookcase, but momma says not to talk about... uh... I can't say anymore.~
@5 = ~I 'spose, but Momma doesn't mind. She says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what's wrong with me in the street? 'Sides, she was mad because I went behind the bookcase again. Says it's not good to be there.~ 
@6 = ~What about the bookcase? Is there something in your house?~
@7 = ~Okay, goodbye and stuff.~
@8 = ~I don't want momma to know I know the secret word. You maybe go talk to her about it, okay?~
@9 = ~Secret word? Tell me about it. We're friends, right?~
@10 = ~Tell me the word or I'll get you in trouble. I'll tell your mother you stole something.~
@11 = ~Well, I guess. Just don't tell momma. I hide behind the bookshelf. You say a word and it opens. It's a silly word, though. The word is "hal-you-eth." I dunno what it means, but it opens the shelf when you say it. Weird, huh?~ 
@12 = ~No, I'll get in trouble. I don't want make things worse. Mommy cries a lot because of people getting sick.~
@13 = ~Why you gotta lie like that? I never did nothing. I'll tell you, just don't lie to momma. It's just a word, anyway. It opens the bookshelf. The word is "hal-you-eth." I dunno what it means, but it opens the shelf when you say it. Weird, huh? Go you now.~ 
@14 = ~I 'spose, but Momma doesn't mind. She says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what's wrong with me in the street?~
@15 = ~Who you? Ha? You come for my house? Don't think so. I'll kick your tail! Like I keep the bad guys downstairs!~
@16 = ~You ugly. Basement ugly.~
@17 = ~Momma says people get sick at home at work and at church, so what's wrong with me in the street?~
