The demon thought the spirit was destroyed, but it was simply overwhelmed by the evil present. Now he can help in the fight against Dester and his accomplices, who ravaged Helm's Castle.~ /*Chaohinon of the Void has been banished back to the dark hells that spawned him. In his place has risen the Guardian Spirit of Helm's Hold. The demon had thought the Spirit destroyed, but it was only suppressed beneath the invading evil. Now it is free to aid in defending against Desther and the cult that has ravaged the Hold so severely. The Spirit offered reward, but it was refused.*/

@8 = ~It stands there, flaunting its evil, with all the time in the world. Chaohinon of the Void is the name of it. Apparently the False Helmites summoned it to crush the Guardian Spirit that watches over Helm's Hold. The demon has done just that, but has not been set free, and now wants someone to find a Black Grimoire and finish the ritual to set it loose upon the world. It promises adequate reward, but they always do, don't they?~
