@0 = ~Need a drink? Times is tough, and a body could use a little lubrication to keep it movin'.~
@1 = ~I wish I had clear answers about the zombies in this district.~
@2 = ~I need a drink. What can you offer?~
@3 = ~I want to rest. Do you have spare rooms?~ 
@4 = ~I'll manage without it, thanks. Goodbye.~
@5 = ~I don't blame you. Been crazy around these parts. First the plague, then this. We'll all be walking the Warrens before we're through.~
@6 = ~Where are the undead coming from?~
@7 = ~What are the "Warrens?"~
@8 = ~Is anyone fighting back against the undead?~
@9 = ~I'd better get to it. Goodbye.~
@10 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>.~
@11 = ~Keep safe. The more warm bodies we have, the better.~
@12 = ~The dying. Seriously, they don't seem concentrated anywhere, and people that die of plague seem to rise from where they fall. There's more near the Great Graveyard in the north. I mean, go figure, the place is full of the dead.~ 
@13 = ~Sorry. Local superstition. "The Warrens of the Damned, burrowing deep beneath the dead to the very doormat of the Hells." It's about the crypts beneath the Great Graveyard. People imagine the worst because they are out of sight. It's nothing.~ 
@14 = ~Harben Ashensmith is here, and the celebrated undead hunter, Drake. He won my "Eat the Most Pickled Eggs" jamboree, two years running. He'll deny it, won't even let you ask, but just you think about that when he's being "oh so serious." Oh, Desther's Helmites are in the district somewhere too. Set up a sanctuary, I think.~ 
@15 = ~I am here to serve, though I can't offer much. The greatest tragedy is the interruption of my beer supply.~
@16 = ~They say there's cause for celebration, that the undead are back to their dirt-naps, so to speak. Good on you if you saved the day.~
@17 = ~Farewell.~ 
@18 = ~Come back whenever you want.~
