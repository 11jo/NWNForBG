@0 = ~How in the name of the gods did you get in here?! Prepare to be destroyed, utterly!~ [NWWAN050]
@1 = ~Please! Attack no more! I am defeated!~ [NWWAN051]
@2 = ~Perhaps I was too rash in attacking you. Please, accept my apology.~ [NWWAN052]
@3 = ~Perhaps you had better answer my questions before I finish what you started.~
@4 = ~Apologies won't save you now, mage! Die!~
@5 = ~I should like to counter that with a question of my own. Why are you in my home?~
@6 = ~Who are you, exactly?~
@7 = ~That isn't how it works. You answer my questions or I kill you.~
@8 = ~Then I shall blast you into dust!~
@9 = ~I am Wanev, a man well-versed in the magical arts and of no small renown. I am somewhat displeased at being defeated by you. My idiot friends will have many a jest at my expense.~
@10 = ~I have been sent here to take a magical gem from you.~
@11 = ~I want your valuables. Anything and everything of value.~
@12 = ~NP: I don't have any questions.~ /*Me have other question.*/
@13 = ~NP: There's a staircase to the upper floors, but for some reason I can't get through it.~ /*One side!  Can't you see I need to get through?*/
@14 = ~You are of no use to me. Die!~
@15 = ~What questions do you have?~
@16 = ~(sigh) I've been defeated by a common houseburglar? Fine, take my gold you barbaric leech!~
@17 = ~Come on, you must have more than that. Hand it over!~
@18 = ~That is not enough! Give me more or I'll feed you a foot of sharpened steel!~
@19 = ~I appreciate not being killed. Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be.~
@20 = ~NP: Thank you for not killing me.~ /*Thank you for healing me.*/
@21 = ~Will you not even leave me enough to feed myself?! Take it and begone!~
@22 = ~Stop, please! If you are so vey desperate take this and begone!~
@23 = ~There is no more gold. I shall be henceforth known as 'Wanev the Idiot Pauper' by those bastards in the Gibbering Twelve! My reputation is ruined!~
@24 = ~So the Serpent still seeks an easy way home. Well, he shall have to become used to disappointment. He cannot have the gem.~
@25 = ~NP: I was hired to take the jewel from you, and I'm going to do it. Give me the stone now!~ /*I have been hired to get the gem and I intend to get it. Hand it over now!*/
@26 = ~You don't understand! I have lost the gem and am quite unable to retrieve it, despite my powers. You would be wise to forget about this job and leave now.~
@27 = ~That is not acceptable. Tell me what happened to the gem.~
@28 = ~I do not care to listen to your excuses. Tell me where the gem is or suffer the consequences.~
@29 = ~Well, if you wish to get yourself killed, why should I care?~
@30 = ~No need to get nasty. I'll tell you.~
@31 = ~I had heard that Elaith intended to take this gem and prior to receiving that information I had taken little interest in the bauble. I wondered why he intended to steal it. To be honest, I am not a patient man. I had better things to do than search through my library trying to match the description of the gem to one of the artifacts in the books. So, I thought it wise to summon an imp or some sort of lesser demon and make him do the legwork. There was, uh, a bit of a setback.~ /*I had heard that Elaith intended to take this gem and prior to receiving that information I had taken little interest in the bauble. I wondered why he intended to steal it.*/
@32 = ~I was somewhat less than careful with the preparations and the little fiend escaped the summoning circle. Let this be a lesson about casting when drunk. The wretch expanded the portal and began to bring forth his demonic minions. I sealed off the area as fast as I could and sobered up.~ /*I was somewhat less than careful with the preparations and the little fiend escaped the summoning circle. Let this be a lesson about casting when drunk.*/
@33 = ~And the gem?~
@34 = ~I don't care. Goodbye.~ /*That is all. Goodbye.*/
@35 = ~NP: In my haste, I left the gem in the summoning room. So, as you can imagine, it's full of demons, and the gem is inside, and it was probably snatched by that damned demon!~ /*So you see, the area is quite full of demonic adversaries and the gem lies within, most likely stolen by that spiteful imp!*/
@36 = ~Where is this area and how do I get there?~
@37 = ~NP: You can go there by that ladder behind your back, though for safety reasons, I've sealed it with my magic.~ /*The door behind me shall teleport you there though I keep it well locked for safety's sake.*/
@38 = ~NP: Break the magical seals and I'll get the jewel.~ /*Give me the key to the door and I shall get the gem myself.*/
@39 = ~Is there anything in the area that could help me get through without becoming demon fodder?~
@40 = ~NP: Take this scroll. The spell written on it will remove the magic seal from the stairs, and know that if you can close the portal, I will be very grateful. You can have the gem anyway. What do you say?~ /*Take the key and know this: if you should be able to close the demon portal, I would be most grateful. The gem is yours regardless. What say you?*/
@41 = ~I will attempt to close the portal as I search for the gem.~
@42 = ~If the reward is good.~
@43 = ~I'm not interested. I just want the gem.~
@44 = ~NP: If there was a trick to it, I'd be up to the task myself.~ /*Is there a reason for the undead infestation?*/
@45 = ~NP: It's too dangerous. Goodbye.~ /*Neither, thanks. Goodbye.*/
@46 = ~You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash. Please return to me when you have closed the portal for I shall try to find a suitable reward in the meantime.~ /*You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash.*/

@48 = ~NP: Take this amulet and my servants will not harm you.~ /*I appreciate not being killed. Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be.*/
@49 = ~I'm sure I can dig up some magical equipment of no small worth while you try to set things right.~
@50 = ~NP: Well, all right. If you change your mind, I'd be very grateful. Take this amulet, and my servants will not harm you.~ /*I appreciate not being killed. Take this wardstone and my servants shall leave you be.*/
@51 = ~Very well. If you change your mind, I would be grateful.~
@52 = ~NP: I sealed it with magic. The thing is, I summoned a demon to do some work for me. However, there was, uh, a little mishap. I was a little careless in my preparations, and the little demon managed to escape the summoning circle. That'll teach me a lesson: never cast spells while drunk. The little rascal stretched the portal and started summoning other demons to help him. I sealed the area as quickly as possible and sobered up immediately.~ /*I was somewhat less than careful with the preparations and the little fiend escaped the summoning circle. Let this be a lesson about casting when drunk.*/
@53 = ~NP: I'll help you solve this problem, for a fee of course.~ /*I might help you... if the price is right.*/
@54 = ~NP: All right! Take this scroll. The spell written on it will break the magical seal on the stairs, and know that if you can close the portal, I'll be very grateful. All you have to do is kill the cursed demon I've summoned and put his vile little heart on the brazier. Then the portal will be closed. His name is Gulgash. Please come back as soon as you close the portal, and I'll look for a suitable reward in the meantime.~ /*You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash.*/
@55 = ~NP: I'll do it. Hopefully the reward will be worth it!~ /*I will do this for you, Gorgotha!*/

@57 = ~What do you want now? Don't be rash and attack me again.~ [NWWAN053]
@58 = ~You mentioned that you had lost the gem?~
@59 = ~NP: I think it's time for you to say goodbye to life. Die!~ /*"Enough. Time for you to die."*/
@60 = ~NP: I don't need anything. Goodbye.~ /*That's all I need. Farewell.*/
@61 = ~Indeed. I made a mistake when summoning that imp and he opened up a demonic portal in my summoning chambers.~
@62 = ~NP: Goodbye. Try not to break anything.~ /*Farewell. Wish me luck.*/
@63 = ~Greetings. Have you changed your mind about attempting to close the portal?~ [NWWAN054]
@64 = ~Hello, again. Have you managed to kill the imp and close the portal?~ [NWWAN055]
@65 = ~I haven't closed the portal yet.~
@66 = ~What was I supposed to do again?~
@67 = ~The portal has been closed.~
@68 = ~NP: Please return when you have closed the portal.~ /*Please return if you do.*/
@69 = ~You need only kill the imp that I originally summoned and place his cursed little heart in the summoning brazier. That should take care of the portal. His name is Gulgash.~
@70 = ~Ah, excellent. Here is a reward for your troubles. A bruised ego and the loss of a couple of magic items are a small price to pay for having my summoning chamber back.~
@71 = ~We are both of the same race. Surely you could take that into consideration and offer a bit more.~
@72 = ~I've just saved your home from a demon infestation. I want a bigger reward.~
@73 = ~Why don't you throw a little extra in so I won't have to hurt you again?~
@74 = ~NP: That's enough. See you later!~ /*That is sufficient. Thank you.*/
@75 = ~Why not, my friend! Here is some extra coin!~
@76 = ~Hmm. You have saved me a great deal of trouble! Here is some extra coin!~
@77 = ~The reward I've given you is quite valuable and quite sufficient.~
@78 = ~Calmly, friend. There is no reason for violence. Take my last coins, then!~
@79 = ~NP: Well, I have a lot to do, and I probably won't see you again. If you want, I can teleport you outside so you can save time getting out of here.~ /*Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you'd like.*/
@80 = ~Sure. That would be good.~ /*That would be good.*/
@81 = ~I'll find my own way out.~
@82 = ~Very well. Goodbye.~

@84 = ~NP: The portal is closed.~ /*The portal has been closed.*/
@85 = ~NP: Hmm. You've saved me a lot of trouble! Here, take some more money! I have a lot to do, and I probably won't see you again. If you want, I can teleport you outside so you can save time getting out of here.~ /*Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you'd like.*/
@86 = ~NP: Your reward is very valuable. And it's more than enough. I have a lot to do, and I probably won't see you again. If you like, I can teleport you outside to save you time getting out of here.~ /*Well, I have some work to do so we shall most likely not meet again. I could set up a teleport portal to help you get out of here, if you'd like.*/
