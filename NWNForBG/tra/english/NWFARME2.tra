@0 = ~NP: Howdy. How you doing?~ /*Greetings. A pleasure to meet you -- one hopes.*/
@1 = ~I'm fine, thank you.~
@2 = ~I feel terrible.~
@3 = ~Enough with the chit chat, I have some questions for you.~
@4 = ~NP: All right, I'm gonna take off.~ /*Okay, me go now. Bye.*/
@5 = ~NP: Take care, <MALEFEMALE>. May Chauntee send you good weather.~ /*Take care young <PRO_MANWOMAN>. May Chauntea favor you with predictable weather.*/
@6 = ~Well, that's good to hear. I thought with the weather being the way it is, you might have been depressed. How may I help you?~
@7 = ~Why would I be depressed about the weather?~
@8 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@9 = ~NP: Well, if it rains too much, there's a flood, and if it doesn't rain at all, there's a drought. Every way you look at it, we farmers have to suffer. And when we suffer, there's no food for you. That means the price of goods in the cities will skyrocket. I figured that's why you're upset. Well, come on, what can I do for you?~ /*Well, if it rains too much then we'll be flooded out, but if it doesn't rain enough then we'll have a drought. Any way you look at it, we farmers are going to suffer, and if we suffer, then there's no food.*/
@10 = ~What's going on here?~
@11 = ~Can you give me directions?~
@12 = ~What do you know about the cult that started the plague?~
@13 = ~We need to talk about finances.~
@14 = ~Goodbye.~
@15 = ~Ah, now, that's the way things go. You're probably depressed about the weather and I don't blame you one bit.~
@16 = ~What can I help you with?~
@17 = ~NP: Yeah, it's all the fun in town now, with all the searchin' for the plague cult, for cryin' out loud. Adventurers going around, trampling crops and spoiling farmer's daughters. Not that I don't want to see that cult ripped out, but there's an established order to things, you know what I mean?~ /*There's all kinds of excitement in town with the hunt for this dang, plague-spreading cult. Adventurers wander around, trampling across crops and ruining many a good farmer's daughter.*/
@18 = ~Uh, sure.~
@19 = ~No clue.~
@20 = ~NP: Now the whole community is suffering, because all the young people have gotten it into their heads that they too can become seekers of these demonic adventures. So they run away, get into trouble, get killed.... And who will take care of their fathers and mothers in their old age? No, all these adventures and seekers are already here.~ /*Off they go, gettin' themselves into trouble or killed, and then who's to take over when their fathers are ready to retire. No sir, I don't sit right proper with all these adventuring folk, I don't.*/
@21 = ~You should take a piece of advice and settle down, raise a family and make an honest living. But don't mind me, nobody else does. Any other questions?~
@22 = ~NP: That's how young people are nowadays. You're running around like headless smokers, and you don't know what's going on around you. I think you still have a lot of questions. You don't have a clue of your own.~ /*Well that's the problem with you young people today, running around like a chicken with its head cut off, no clue about what's going on around you.*/
@23 = ~NP: I don't have time for that, and the town is small enough as it is. I've got sowing to do, and chickens to feed, and a cow to milk, and a lot of other things to do. You're not going to settle down here and start a farm, are you? There's plenty of arable land around town. No, there ain't. You adventurers are always in a hurry. What else can I do for you?~ /*I don't have time to be a road map and this town's not really all that big. I've got planting and feeding and milking and all sorts of jobs that need done. Don't suppose you're looking to settle down and be a farmhand?*/
@24 = ~I'd like to take my scythe to them and cut 'em short at the bloody kneecaps, that's what I know about them. Anything else?~
@25 = ~I don't have time to talk about gold, I have to spend all my time just trying to make a little. It's getting so a man can't afford to feed his kids anymore.~
@26 = ~Um, sorry, nevermind.~
@27 = ~Lady Aribeth has sent me to collect a special tax to help finance the search for the cult.~
@28 = ~Give me some gold or you'll be harvesting with a broken leg.~
@29 = ~Is there something else I may do?~
@30 = ~NP: All right, I think I still have some potatoes in the pantry somewhere. We'll make do with those, but you take this 110 gold pieces. That's all I got. I'd better get back to work now. I hope the hail doesn't hit my crop, or we'll all starve to death this winter.~ /*Oh, well, I guess I have a few moldy potatoes left in the root cellar that we can survive on until I can earn some more money. Here's fifty gold; it's all I have though.*/
@31 = ~NP: Please don't! My whole family's fate depends on the harvest. Here's 110 gold pieces, but leave me alone. I never trusted those wandering adventurers. Heroes. Ugh!~ /*Please no! My family depends on my farming to survive the winters. I'll give you 50 gold, just let me alone.*/
@32 = ~I don't have time to speak to you anymore.~
