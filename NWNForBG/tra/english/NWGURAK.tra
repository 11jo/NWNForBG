@47 = ~It come with room. Wizards say it to protect me. Me needs no protection, though! Me great warrior!~
@48 = ~They all wizards, lots of wizards with more magic than shaman Brightfist! They very rich and they fights lots with each other, fight to rule all the lands, maybe. Wizards kill each other for long time to see who biggest wizard. Big battles in tower, me told, lots of wizards run away and not come back.~ 
@49 = ~Wizards be fighting, of course. Rest of city not know wizards have battle after battle here in tower... many wizards be dead. Fighting still not over. Old big wizard run away, me told. Or maybe he be dead. Not know. New wizard now, he be Archmage Arcane... human by name of Maugrim.~ 
@50 = ~Not know. It's a big tower, me not know how wizards walk there. Me think they not know how to build a hut. Wizard once say they goes from tower to tower through big shiny lights. Magic, maybe. Me not trust magic, would never go into shiny light. Me not stupid.~
@51 = ~Eh? What you want?~
@52 = ~Maugrim very powerful, for human, very dangerous. Has much magic, he does... serve someone else, too, me knows. Me not know who he serves, but has greater power even than him. Many wizards now serve same one that Maugrim does. With all power Maugrim has, orcs only do good by his side. If human lives up to bargain, that is.~ 
@53 = ~What has he offered you?~
@54 = ~Not know. Wizards fight each other for long time now, in secret. Dead wizards everywhere, and lots flee. Maugrim and followers control tower, now. Old wizard come back soon, maybe. Maybe he take back tower. Not matter. Maugrim control tower now, and Maugrim have many plans.~ 
@55 = ~Maugrim make great army. He make army out of humans in city, out of barbarians... out of orcs, too. Many, many orcs. Wizards have great magic and fight in army... it be very powerful.~
@56 = ~What is this army for?~
@57 = ~You think the orcs will agree?~
@58 = ~New wizard take over now as biggest wizard... he tell wizards what to do. He invite orcs to come to tower and offers us many things. Wants our help, he does, he is very smart.~
@59 = ~He invite all ambassadors here... he know orcs be very important. Want us to help. He still very busy fighting in tower, though... not have much time to talk to me, which be bad.~
@60 = ~Wizard say there be shiny light beyond doors in outer room. Me not see it yet. He say if me go there they kills me good. Me not like fight magic, so me not go. No reason to, anyway.~
@61 = ~Hah! Me likes you, but me not tells you that. You get own deal with wizards.~
@62 = ~To conquer! We take north, we be promised. First we take human city of Neverwinter, though. Maugrim want Neverwinter very bad. Maugrim say army be led by elf woman. Me not like that so much... elfs be dumb and tasty, not good leaders. Maugrim say elf woman Aribeth lead for sure, though.~ 
@63 = ~Aribeth?!~
@64 = ~How do you know that's true?~
@65 = ~You trust a traitor to lead the army?~
@66 = ~Obould wait long time to make big army. Orcs face human alliance, always gets pushed back. We join with wizards and humans, though, and maybe we win... win big. Obould come already, though. Join army even now, no can stop. Me just here to tells wizards so.~ 
@67 = ~Not know elf woman. Hear she very strong, very nasty. Maybe she not so bad. She not tells Obauld what to do, though, that for sure.~
@68 = ~Maugrim tells me himself. Me gots no reason to think he lie. Why tells orc that elf going to leads him? If lie be big, dumb lie.~
@69 = ~Traitor, elf, whatever. Maugrim say he has her under control real good, so me not have much worry. If it go bad, orcs kill wizards and go home.~
@70 = ~Why you come here? Me important orc, and not want be disturbed! All wizards need is King Obould, me says! They not need yous!~ [GURAK51]
@71 = ~You go away! Me not want be distrurbed! Wizards need me, they do, only me! They not need yous or nobody elses!~ [GURAK52]
