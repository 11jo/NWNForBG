@1 = ~Who might you be? No, don't answer because I really don't care. You have gone and tracked up my kitchen with nary an invitation, nor even an unlocked door!

@2 = ~Shoo!~
@3 = ~Don't make me break mine foot off in your nethers! Get going!~
@4 = ~If you want, I could give you an entire course on cooking. But knowing you adventurer types, you won't be around long enough.~
@5 = ~You're not welcome here!~
