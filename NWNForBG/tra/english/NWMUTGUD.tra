@1 = ~This here's the Green Griffon Inn. I don't know if there's a room for you... for that, you'll have to talk to Mutamin, the owner.~
@2 = ~You're welcome here at the Green Griffon, my <LADYLORD>. At the very least, it's a shelter from the local vagabonds.~
@3 = ~Mind yourself while staying at the inn, <SIRMAAM>.~
