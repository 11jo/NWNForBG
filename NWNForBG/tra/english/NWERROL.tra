@0 = ~Why my children, huh? Why couldn't the Wailing have taken someone like you, instead?~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I can spare a few moments. Perhaps the idle chatter will clear my thoughts.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Would you buy a cure if it was offered?~
@8 = ~Thanks for the distraction from my troubles - I hope your kin don't fall prey the same as mine...~
@9 = ~Neverwinter... This city was a good place once. Now it's nothing but burning bodies piled in the streets. I don't even have a family anymore.~
@10 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@11 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@12 = ~I want to ask something else.~ 
@13 = ~I know I don't want to get it. The Wailing took my entire family, one after the other. I watched 'em die, every one - They shriveled up from the inside.~
@14 = ~Do you mean physically or spiritually?~
@15 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@16 = ~As if I care about anything else right now. I'm scared to go home, to see the bodies. I'm scared maybe I'll catch it too. You want to go poking around for stories, go right ahead. I'm going to stay right here: in the street and out of trouble.~
@17 = ~A... a cure? There were rumors that one was in the works, but nobody believed us common folk would get it any time soon. W-why do you ask if I would pay for it?~
@18 = ~I have the cure! Give me all your gold and you can have it!~
@19 = ~To find out if you have gold! Hand it over, now!~
@20 = ~Nevermind. I just have a few other questions.~
@21 = ~Don't you go starting that kind of crap with me. I've already been took for everything I've got. Ask your questions and get lost!~
@22 = ~It's set out like an eye - the City Core, where we are now, is the pupil. Around it lie the other districts... Through it all runs the river, all fed by tears. Do you want to hear about the Beggar's Nest? The Docks? The Blacklake? The Peninsula? The City Core? Take your pick - I have a lifetime, however short.~ 
@23 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@24 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@25 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@26 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@27 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula.~
@28 = ~That would depend on what you are looking for. I suppose I could make my best guess at what you want.~
@29 = ~Would I know the difference? It's just that the eyes go dead long before a person stops moving... That's when the Wailing starts... Maybe those Helmites are right. Maybe it's a wasting of the soul. Maybe the gods are mad at us... My question is how come I survived?~ 
@30 = ~Bah, won't tell us "simple people." They think we'd panic if there was no hope or stampede if a cure was announced. I ain't heard a single thing, and I probably won't. I'm not sure whether it's a blessing or a curse but I'm alive...~ 
@31 = ~W-what? You... you would rob me in the street in full view of anyone walking by? Are you insane? What about guards? What about watchmen?~
@32 = ~I'm a guard and you are nobody. Hand over your gold or die like a dog!~
@33 = ~Ahh, I was just joking around. Sorry about that.~
@34 = ~That's where we is now. Got all your basic services as such. Lots of different kinds of people make their home here... Less every day, mind you... Castle Never is located in the west, where all our "enlightened elite" do business. I myself buy everything I need abroad. Of course, because of the Howling Death, there's not much to get now...~
@35 = ~Beggar's Nest? Don't let anyone sour you on that place - Good honest poor people live and die there. Not like Blacklake or the Docks.~
@36 = ~And don't think it's coincidence that the plague seemed to start in the Beggar's Nest, either! The rich needed an excuse to clear it out. Now there's even some zombies or something... I hope none of them are my family - I wouldn't want them to have to be like that.~ 
@37 = ~Things are a lot better, too. The Wailing's still rough, but someone cleared out some zombies or something that were causing trouble. I hope none of them zombies were my family - Though if they were, I'd like to thank whoever did the clearing for giving them their due rest...~
@38 = ~I used to do the occasional odd job in Docks district, but not any more. Didn't like working for pirates.~
@39 = ~Last little while I've heard the place is almost overrun with thieves, too. People seem to really need gold for something. Stay clear of the Docks. Losing your family is worry enough without losing your purse, too. The guards are no help neither.~ 
@40 = ~I hear things are getting better though. There was some infighting or something, but now it's been settled. Less muggings too. Maybe you heard about that, or maybe you had a part in it? I dunno, but the area seems much more calm... aside from the Wailing, of course.~ 
@41 = ~Bah! Bunch of stuck up nobles. The Wailing has them tied in knots - Kills them just the same as any commoner, and that fact drives 'em nuts.~
@42 = ~Apparently they're even seizing resources meant for us poorer folk. My brother wouldn't have passed away so easy if he only had a little food in him.~
@43 = ~What do you know about that?~
@44 = ~I even heard they were trying to hoard food and part of a cure! Someone put a stop to it though. Maybe that was you? Well, I'm glad they got shook up. They deserved it and it quieted things down out there, too.~ 
@45 = ~I'm not actually a part of it, so I guess I'm in the clear. Not that I know all that much. See, the Blacklake nobles, and I don't know exactly who, are hoarding food. It's made them a lot of enemies. Last I heard there was rioting because of them. Don't know how it turned out. Not my business. Being the last left of my family, I've got other worries.~ 
@46 = ~It's not for me to say. I'm not involved and I don't know much, anyway. Being the last left of my family, I've got other worries.~
@47 = ~You really don't know the city if you have to ask. Nobody wants to go to the Peninsula. That's where the prison is. The prison is usually run pretty strict, but I don't want to imagine what the plague has done to it. I even heard -but I ain't saying from who- that some prisoners and guards have been killed. Wonder what's going on in there...~
@48 = ~You really don't know the city if you have to ask. Nobody wants to go to the Peninsula. That's where the prison is. It's settled down a bit now. I guess there was some killings, and even the captain of the place died. Not my business, but I'm glad they sorted it out. You have something to do with that? Good on you if you did.~ 
@49 = ~You work a bit outside the law, maybe? Don't worry, my lips are sealed. I know somewhere that might interest you, though... The Moonstone Mask near the Peninsula exit in the City Core west - They have all sorts of interesting things there. And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.~ 
@50 = ~You one of them nature-talking forest-walkers, aren't you? I suppose you might visit the Druid Tree, it is in the southwest of the district, next to the gate. And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast.~
@51 = ~Are you looking for a temple or something? Then you need to go to the temple of Tyr, it is in the western part of the Heart of the city, north of the main square. And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast.~ 
@52 = ~Are you by any chance a spellcaster? The Cloak Tower is the right place for you, it is in the east of the district .. And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast.~
@53 = ~You need a good blade or something? Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core has the best. And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest.~ 
@54 = ~You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to &quot;Shining Weapons and Armor for Knights&quot;, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Well, thieves are welcome in the Mask of the Moonstone. And if you want a sucker to absorb damage for ya, visit the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southeast.~ 
@55 = ~But... no, please! I... I just want to get through all of this alive! Here... take it! Take all the gold I have! Take it and... and get out of my sight... just go...~
@56 = ~I... I don't understand what you are talking about. Ask your questions and leave me be.~
@57 = ~A cure for the Wailing? You actually have a cure?! Gods! I... I have to have it! Please... please, I'll give you all the gold that I have... That's everything I have and... and... you are smiling... Why are you... You have no cure... I've been fooled...~ 
@58 = ~HAHAHA! What an idiot!~
@59 = ~Don't take it too hard. It's just business.~
@60 = ~You evil piece of garbage... you took all I had left. Get out of my sight... get out!!~
@61 = ~Leave my sight you evil creature. Leave my sight and never return!~
@62 = ~What is it you need, then? I have worries of my own, you know...~
