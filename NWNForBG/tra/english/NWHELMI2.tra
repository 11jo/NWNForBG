@0 = ~Greetings, and welcome to this small house of Helm. Do you seek a blessing in this troubled time?~
@1 = ~I welcome the offer, thank you.~
@2 = ~NP: Bless, but I doubt it will be of any use.~ /*Go ahead, though I doubt it shall do any good.*/
@3 = ~You will forgive me if I do not indulge, thank you.~
@4 = ~I am not interested in your hollow blessings.~
@5 = ~Can you offer basic temple services?~
@6 = ~It is an anointing of the soul. You will feel the effects like any of willing heart might, I am sure. And now, what has truly brought you to this place? You have a great weight upon you.~ /*And now, what has truly brought you to this place? You have a great weight upon you.*/
@7 = ~Do you know who is creating the zombies?~
@8 = ~Will people be safe if I bring them here?~
@9 = ~Have your blessings had an effect on the progress of the plague?~
@10 = ~Goodbye.~
@11 = ~No, I can see that you are possessed of another purpose. What can I do for you?~
@12 = ~I have temple services, if you require.~
@13 = ~I understand it was one of the Waterdhavian creatures... a yuan-ti. Such horrid creatures. I do not know why it did what it did. Ultimately, it doesn't matter. She is dead and the zombie threat is over. Of course, people should still come here. The plague still rages.~ /*Ultimately, it doesn't matter. She is dead and the zombie threat is over. Of course, people should still come here. The plague still rages.*/
@14 = ~The zombies? I know little except that their disrespectful attack upon the city degrades the hopes of all Neverwintans. However, if you find the one responsible, tell them they have helped even as they meant to do the city harm.~ /*The zombies? I know little except that their disrespectful attack upon the city degrades the hopes of all Neverwintans.*/
@15 = ~Well, as I understand it, the Beggar's Nest is no longer infested with undead, so it is fairly safe to venture outside. Of course, I still welcome all that would seek the word of Helm. The plague still rages. We are far from true safety.~ /*Of course, I still welcome all that would seek the word of Helm. The plague still rages. We are far from true safety.*/
@16 = ~Definitely. This is a sanctuary against the undead. They cannot enter here, by virtue of the power behind my blessings. I will see to the safety of all who enter, and will administer to them indiscriminately. All will be treated equally.~ /*I will see to the safety of all who enter, and will administer to them indiscriminately. All will be treated equally.*/
@17 = ~Is this the only haven? People could fortify elsewhere.~
@18 = ~Not as yet, but hope is powerful. Each blessing eases the mind, even if unable to prevent destruction of the body. The Great Graveyard literally overflows, but we will not give up. Hope will deliver this city. You will see.~ /*Not as yet, but hope is powerful. Each blessing eases the mind, even if unable to prevent destruction of the body.*/
@19 = ~As you will, but these doors are open should you need. All are welcome to receive the blessing.~
@20 = ~Bah! I offer hope. Some huddle in the filth of the Silver Serpent tavern, but that doesn't make it a sanctuary. Only here will people get the blessings they need. Only here do we understand the plague.~ /*Bah! I offer hope. Some huddle in the filth of the Silver Serpent tavern, but that doesn't make it a sanctuary.*/
@21 = ~More have come seeking shelter, I see. Do you wish to receive the blessing I offer?~
