@0 = ~Formosa sent you to kill me, didn't she?! Didn't she?! Why are you here?!~ [NWMELD54]
@1 = ~I'm here to free the dryad you stole, sorcerer.~
@2 = ~So you have the dryad, then? Unbelievable!~
@3 = ~Well... there is the matter of the dryad in the cage.~
@4 = ~I did not steal her! I found her wandering the streets and took her in. It was my plan originally to concoct a cure for this plague from her and sell it to the highest bidder. Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.~ /*Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.*/
@5 = ~You are... here for the dryad? Yes... yes, I found her wandering the streets and took her in. At first it was my plan to use her to find a cure for the plague and sell it to the highest bidder. Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.~ /*You are... here for the dryad? Yes... yes, I found her wandering the streets and took her in. At first it was my plan to use her to find a cure for the plague and sell it to the highest bidder.*/
@6 = ~You... you have come for the dryad, not for me? So she is indeed one of the Waterdhavian beasts, as I suspected. I had thought at first to use her to formulate a cure for the plague, and then sell it to the highest bidder and make a fortune. Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah! No doubt it is best she is taken, or I could not rid myself of her influence.~ /*Since then, however, her... charms... have weakened my judgment and prevented my research. Bah!

@7 = ~So... are you saying, then, that Formosa did not send you? You... you will spare me if I give you the key to the Dryad's cage?~
@8 = ~Who's this Formosa? I have no idea who you're talking about.~
@9 = ~I have no intention of sparing you, but all the pleading is quite amusing.~
@10 = ~No, Formosa did send me, actually. Now you die.~
@11 = ~That's right. Give me the dryad and you can go.~
@12 = ~I want the dryad as well as the key to your warehouse. You can live.~
@13 = ~Make me an offer and I'll consider it.~
@14 = ~That fool elven woman didn't send you? Then why are you here?~
@15 = ~To kill you, I suppose. And it's high time I got back to it.~
@16 = ~I'm simply here looking for some coin.~
@17 = ~I meant no harm. You attacked me, remember?~
@18 = ~No! I will kill you, fool, I will!!~
@19 = ~You are... unexpectedly merciful. I suppose I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take her. I will hope not to see you again. Oh, and you'll probably want to deliver the key to Formosa as well. Besides the Dryad's cage, it also opens my warehouses. Now go. Get out.~ /*You are... unexpectedly merciful. I suppose I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take her. I will hope not to see you again.*/
@20 = ~You are... unexpectedly merciful. I suppose I should be grateful. Here is the key to the dryad's cage... take her. I will hope not to see you again. Besides the Dryad's cage, it also opens my warehouses. Now go. Get out.~
@21 = ~Spare my life and I'll give you 1800 gp. It is all I have... and surely more than Formosa could possibly have paid you.~
@22 = ~Why don't I take your money myself?~
@23 = ~I would need your silver tooth as well as the key to your warehouse.~
@24 = ~Sounds like this Formosa wants to kill you. Pay me more and I'll deal with her for you.~
@25 = ~Give me more and I'll deal with Formosa for you.~
@26 = ~Fine. The gold and the dryad, and you go free.~
@27 = ~No, I'd rather kill you.~
@28 = ~Well if it's coin you seek, I have plenty. I am more than willing to offer it to you in exchange for a task, perhaps?~
@29 = ~What do you have in mind, exactly?~
@30 = ~And what's to stop me from just taking all you own anyway?~
@31 = ~Too much bother. I'd rather kill you.~
@32 = ~My estate is well-guarded. You expect me to believe you came here simply by accident? Your type seeks coin and treasure, yes?~
@33 = ~N-nothing. It... is all the coin I have here, however. Please, I beg you for mercy!~
@34 = ~So the wench did send you. Bah! Fine... I shall rip out my silver tooth and give you both it and the key. I am not above purchasing my life.~
@35 = ~Fine. I'll take them and your gold... and you flee before I change my mind.~
@36 = ~You know, I don't have to do this. Pay me more and I'll take care of Formosa for you.~
@37 = ~Forget it. The dryad is all that's important... just leave.~
@38 = ~Just give me the tooth and key. Keep your gold and run.~
@39 = ~Nevermind the tooth. Just the key and your gold will do.~
@40 = ~I can give you the 1500 gold pieces now. If you deal with Formosa and return, I can get another 1500 gold pieces by then and pay you that as well.~
@41 = ~Give up the dryad, as well. Then I'll do it.~
@42 = ~No, just give me the dryad and your gold and I'll leave you be.~
@43 = ~No, I'm not killing anyone... I came for the dryad. Just go.~
@44 = ~Th-thank you, then, for your mercy... such as it is. I shall have to repay the wench someday soon for this indignity. Here is 1800 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.~ /*Here is 500 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@45 = ~I have 1500 gold pieces now... take that and kill Formosa before she convinces some other fool to try to kill me. When you return, I'll pay you another 1500 gp.~
@46 = ~Nothing. I have little doubt you have looted my home already. But... if you kill Formosa for me I can give you even more gold later... gold you won't get any other way.~
@47 = ~I suppose I shall take what mercy you will give. Very well... AGGGHHK!... h-here... is my tooth... and the key to the warehouse as well. And here is my ransom: 1800 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.~ /*And here is my ransom: 1800 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@48 = ~I suppose I shall take what mercy you will give. Very well... AGGGHHK!... h-here... is my tooth... a-and the key to the warehouse. As for the dryad... the warehouse key also opens her cage. Take it... and take her and get out. I hope I shall not see you again.~ /*As for the dryad... the warehouse key also opens her cage. Take it... and take her and get out. I hope I shall not see you again.*/
@49 = ~I suppose I should be thankful at your mercy. Here... take the key that the wench wants. Just take it. And here is my ransom: 1800 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.~ /*And here is my ransom: 500 gold pieces. The warehouse key also opens the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@50 = ~As you wish. You'll find the elven wench preaching in the square in the southeast part of the district. I truly wish I could see the look on her face! Here is the 1500 gold pieces and the key to the dryad's cage. You will get the rest of your gold when I am certain that Formosa is dead. I shall see you then.~ /*As you wish. You'll find the elven wench preaching in the square in the southeast part of the district. I truly wish I could see the look on her face!*/

@52 = ~As you wish. I am not above buying my life and fleeing my home, after all. Here is 1800 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.~ /*Here is 500 gp, which is all I have... and the key to the dryad's cage. Take her... take her and get out. I hope not to see you again.*/
@53 = ~I am leaving. Now begone.~ [NWMELD55]
@54 = ~Formosa is still alive. I'm waiting for you to kill that thing.~ /*I can't wait until this whole plague business is done with.*/
@55 = ~It has come to my attention that Formosa is, indeed, dead as we agreed. Well done. Here is the 1500 gold pieces that I promised, though it was not easy to acquire. This is sufficient, I hope.~ [NWMELD52] /*It has come to my attention that Formosa is, indeed, dead as we agreed. Well done.*/
@56 = ~Don't you think saving your life is worth a little more gold than that?~
@57 = ~You better dig a little deeper... your life is on the line, fool.~
@58 = ~Enough, give me gold.~
@59 = ~It doesn't matter... I won't let you live, regardless.~
@60 = ~Err... yes, of course... but this is simply all the wealth I can obtain. I could get no more even if I tried.~
@61 = ~That's enough, give me gold.~
@62 = ~I... I... I have no more coin. Please... just take the gold and leave, I beg you!~
@63 = ~Here it is. Now leave... I hope I will not see you again.~

@65 = ~What? But... I have nothing else of value! Why would you do this?!~
@66 = ~I was only kidding. Your gold will do.~
@67 = ~I bet you have more than you're saying. I'll just search your corpse!~
@68 = ~Because I enjoy it, of course.~
