@0 = ~If you desire anything, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I'll just be a moment.~
@1 = ~Can I just ask you a quick question?~
@2 = ~Very well. I'll wait.~
@3 = ~So long as it *is* quick.~
@4 = ~Do you know anything about what's going on in Luskan?~
@5 = ~What are all these people here for?~
@6 = ~Anything interesting about the patrons?~
@7 = ~Who owns this place?~
@8 = ~I won't detain you.~
@9 = ~Talk to Mutamin if you need anything right away, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. It might be a while before I can get to you.~
@10 = ~Aside from the fact that its gates are closed due to the plague? No, not really. We're always busy, here, though, so that makes no difference.~
@11 = ~I've no idea, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. I just serve them.~
@12 = ~No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them except for that Zamithra woman, perhaps. Or the minotaur. He's a frightening one.~
@13 = ~What's so strange about Zamithra?~
@14 = ~A minotaur? Tell me about him.~
@15 = ~No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them except maybe for the minotaur. He's a scary one.~
@16 = ~No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them except for that Zamithra woman, perhaps.~
@17 = ~No, these are all regular folk in here. Nothing too unique about any of them.~
@18 = ~Mutamin. You'll find him behind the counter near the back hall, more as like.~
@19 = ~Not strange, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. She's got guts, and I admire her. Zamithra is a famous mercenary captain, renowned for her revilement of men.~
@20 = ~Oh. Do you feel the same as she does?~
@21 = ~A minotaur? Tell me about him.~
@22 = ~Well, a short time ago, a minotaur arrived during the night and demanded a room. His name was Gor or Zar or something like that. He's been holed up in a room upstairs. He only unlocks the door to take food and ale. A LOT of food and ale. I don't know what he's hiding from. He seems to be having a good time getting drunk, regardless. Any other questions?~ /*He's been holed up in a room upstairs. He only unlocks the door to take food and ale. A LOT of food and ale. I don't know what he's hiding from.

@23 = ~What was so strange about Zamithra?~
@24 = ~Oh, of course not. You've nothing to worry about, dear man. Ha ha! But I do think of her as a good example for what women can accomplish if we set our minds to it, don't you think?~ /*But I do think of her as a good example for what women can accomplish if we set our minds to it, don't you think?*/
