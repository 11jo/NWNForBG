@0 = ~By Jiminy, how many of you are in there? You must be friends of good man Desther.~ [NWBRIG56]
@1 = ~I had some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~NP: Youre out of your mind, right? Well, it doesnt matter. Well, I guess a couple of questions wont hurt an old man like me... Helm will protect me if Im wrong.~ /*Well I reckon a few questions won't harm an old fella like myself... Helm protect me if I be wrong.*/
@4 = ~NP: So you know Dester?~ /*So you know this Des-ter guy, yuh?*/
@5 = ~What is this place?~
@6 = ~Travel well...~
@7 = ~NP: Certainly. The first time I saw the good man Dester was on the night of Shieldmeet. He must be an important man, because everything was closed when he left for Neverwinter. Now that hes back, maybe things will start to get better here.~ /*'At I do. I first met good man Desther the night of Shieldmeet. He must be an important fella, 'cause the whole place shut down when he left for Neverwinter.*/
@8 = ~Shieldmeet. What's that?~
@9 = ~NP: Why did you decide that everything here was &quot;closed&quot;?~ /*Why do you think the place "shut down?"*/
@10 = ~You're sure Desther's back?~
@11 = ~NP: There is a road here, it leads straight to Helms fortress, where all the priests live. There are no better hosts than helmites, I tell you, because they will always protect you in difficult times. Neverwinter is in a completely different direction - at least it would be if the good man Dester did not make me take my bull and ... I probably shouldnt have said it ...~ /*Why, this here's the road up to Helm's Hold, where all the priests live. There's no better lord than a Helmite, I say, 'cause they'll always protect you in hard times.*/
@12 = ~"Good man" Desther's a traitor. Lord Nasher sent me to hunt him down.~
@13 = ~NP: Well, its a harvest festival for people like me. But the Helmites come to the fortress, sit there and think how they can protect us next year. Priests and paladins keep changing jobs. If they were in Baldurs Gate one year, they will be in Neverwinter the next.~ /*Why, it's a plantin' festival for folks like me. For the Helmites, though, they come to the keep and figger out how to protect us over the comin' year.*/
@14 = ~Anything strike you as odd this Shieldmeet?~
@15 = ~Fear o' the plague, I reckon. Not very befittin' of Helm, if you ask me, but mebbe stayin' in all the time helps 'em protect us, somehow.~
@16 = ~NP: How do you know they didnt all die of the plague?~ /*How you know they not dead?*/
@17 = ~Right as rain. I was headin' down to catch some riverfish for tomorrow's supper when he and his priest friends showed up right where you're standin' now.~
@18 = ~Which way did he go?~
@19 = ~NP: In the name of Jiminy, are you serious? And I did *tell* my wife that there was something wrong with the good man Dester. When he left for Neverwinter, he told me to take the bull and tear down the bridge behind him. He said it was to protect me from plague carriers who managed to escape quarantine.~ /*When he left for Neverwinter, he had me and my ox tear down the bridge behind him. He said it was to protect me from plague-bearers breaking quarantine.*/
@20 = ~NP: Ah, I remember waking up to hearing screams and sounds of battle from the fortress. I figured the priests got drunk as hell at their party. Do you need anything else?~ /*Aye, I remember wakin' up to hear shouts and the sound of fightin' comin' from the keep. Just thought the priests were in their cups after all the festivities.*/
@21 = ~NP: I still deliver goods there, although they are no longer taken as they used to be. And they dont go to the gate anymore. Every week I leave a half-full cart outside, and in exchange they leave me an empty one and enough gold to cover all my expenses.~ /*I leave a half-stocked wagon outside the keep every week an' they leave me an empty one to swap to, with enough gold to make it worth my while.*/
@22 = ~NP: Directly to the fortress - this is the only road along which you can go. Is there anything else you would like to know?~ /*Up to the keep - The only way anyone can go, now that the bridge is out.*/
@23 = ~NP: It was a very good bridge. My father built it, and I, an idiot, destroyed it... What an infection!!! Jiminy, you cant even trust your own neighbors these days. Enough, I will never take that risk again and trust no one. Do what you want. Im leaving.~ /*Jiminy, you can't even trust your neighbors these days. That's it, I'm not taking a chance on nobody no more. Do what you want. I'm leaving.*/

@25 = ~Good man Desther told me there might be trouble... Guess you're it.~
