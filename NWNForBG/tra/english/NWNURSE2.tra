@0 = ~Is there something I can do for you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Make it quick - my time is better spent easing the suffering of my patients.~
@4 = ~What can you tell me about the plague?~
@5 = ~Have you heard any rumors lately?~
@6 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@7 = ~May whatever Gods you pray to keep you safe from the plague.~
@8 = ~As much as most, less than some, I suppose. I've seen my share of the dead and dying since I started to work here tending the sick.~
@9 = ~Have you heard anything about a cure for the Wailing Death?~
@10 = ~Did you hear anything about the attack on the Academy?~
@11 = ~How did you end up tending the afflicted here?~
@12 = ~NP: I'd like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@13 = ~NP: I heard something. Dester and Aribet fight all the time, and Fentik tries to make up for it. Neither of them pays any attention to the nurse, who is quietly minding her own business, so I know a lot about each of them.~ /*None of them pay any attention to a quiet little nurse going about her duties, so I've heard all sorts of stuff about each and every one of them.*/
@14 = ~Tell me what you've heard about Desther.~
@15 = ~Tell me what you've heard about Aribeth.~
@16 = ~Tell me what you've heard about Fenthick.~
@17 = ~NP: I'm here to care for the sick and dying, not tell you about the sights. Besides, all you have to do is walk out the front door of the Hall of Justice. The Heart of the City has all sorts of shops, inns, and other establishments.~ /*Besides, all you have to do is go outside the front door of the Hall of Justice. The City Core district has every kind of shop, store or inn you'll ever need, I suspect.*/
@18 = ~There's no cure for the plague, everybody knows that! All I can do is try to ease their suffering and make their last days less painful.~
@19 = ~That's it? You haven't heard the rumors about a cure from Waterdeep?~
@20 = ~I heard Fenthick and Desther whispering about it once, but they clammed up as soon as they saw me. That Desther gave me a foul look.~
@21 = ~What were they saying?~
@22 = ~You don't like Desther much, do you?~
@23 = ~I was a midwife, before the plague. But there ain't many babies being born now - not live ones, anyhow. I heard Castle Never needed nurses to tend their sick and dying, so I came.~
@24 = ~Aren't you afraid of contracting the plague yourself?~
@25 = ~NP: I have to tend to the sick, but I can spare a few minutes for you.~ /*I really should be tending the sick, but for you my <PRO_LADYLORD> I can spare a few moments.*/
@26 = ~Aribeth doesn't like him, I know that much. He's got a sharp tongue and a sour face, but I think it's more than that. But it's not really my place to speak of such things.~
@27 = ~NP: Tell me. There's no harm done.~ /*Come now, telling me won't do any harm.*/
@28 = ~Lady Aribeth's always telling Fenthick not to put so much faith in Desther and his Helmites. You know they're lovers? Fenthick and Aribeth, I mean. Of course you know. Everybody knows.~
@29 = ~NP: Poor Fentick. He's caught between Dester and Aribeth, and he's always having to go to one side or the other when they argue about the best way to save the city. You think he's always on Aribeth's side because they're lovers. But Fentick is an honest man, and when Aribeth is wrong, he tells her so.~ /*Poor Fenthick. He's caught in the middle between Desther and Aribeth, always ends up having to pick one side or the other when they argue about how to save the city.*/
@30 = ~A cure from Waterdeep? How are they going to get it here with Neverwinter under quarantine! Throw it up over the walls? You're talking crazy.~
@31 = ~Desther was saying the attack was all Aribeth's fault, and Fenthick was trying to defend her. That's all I heard.~
@32 = ~NP: He's a grim man, that one. A fierce man with a sharp tongue. But he's from the clergy, and his Helmites have done a lot for the city, helping the sick. Dester's not very friendly, but that's no crime. I just try to stay away from him.~ /*He's sour, that one. A bitter man with a sharp tongue. But he's a man of the cloth, and his Helmites do good work around the city, helping the sick.*/
@33 = ~NP: Some people will never socialize with the sick. They shut themselves up in their homes and do not come out, no matter what the need may be. And still they catch the Howling Death. Helmites don't get sick by helping the sick, so why do I have to get sick? The Pestilence takes whoever it wants, whenever it wants. There's nothing anyone can do about it.~ /*Some people won't have nothing to do with the sick. They board themselves up in their homes and don't come out for no reason. And they still get the Wailing Death.*/
@34 = ~NP: Dester and his Helmites showed up shortly after the pestilence began, just in time to find themselves trapped in the city when the quarantine was established. Dester says they came because they heard of Neverwinter's suffering, but Lady Aribeth thinks that doesn't add up in time. At least that's what she told Fentic.~ /*Desther says they came because they heard about Neverwinter's suffering, but it seems like odd timing to Lady Aribeth. Or so she told Fenthick once.*/
@35 = ~Is there something else you wanted to know? Or can I get back to my duties?~
@36 = ~What do you want? And be quick about it - can't you see how busy I am here?~
