@0 = ~Oy! You there... you're from Neverwinter, ain't ye? Working for Aribeth?~
@1 = ~I am, and proud of it.~
@2 = ~Aribeth? Yeah!~
@3 = ~Leave me be, stranger.~
@4 = ~Get lost.~
@5 = ~I thought so, you 'ad the cure for Wailing all sewed up! Sure, I should have expected you!~
@6 = ~And who are you, then?~
@7 = ~I don't want to talk to you.~
@8 = ~I thought so, though the stories did not mention you were... special.~
@9 = ~As you will.~
@10 = ~Name's Darktongue. Darktongue Breakbone. I've been out here since you cured the Wailing, looking for signs a' where it came from.~
@11 = ~What have you uncovered?~
@12 = ~What are you doing here, then?~
@13 = ~Goodbye.~
@14 = ~I heard what you been told, I'm sure... there were a cult behind the plague an' they be somewhere in the North. I ain't sure where, exactly, but I have me suspicions.~
@15 = ~Where do you suspect that cult is based?~
@16 = ~What happen in city?~
@17 = ~Why don't you join me?~
@18 = ~Well, since I were ambushed along the north road, my bum knee's been keepin' me grounded. I found out some, though... maybe I could be of help to ye.~
@19 = ~Listen, then. If you find anything, you tell me. Two heads are better than one and all that. We adventurers need to stick together to find those bastards and punish 'em! Best o' luck to you! I wish my knee was healed up so I could come with!~
@20 = ~Along the North Road and I'll tell you why. There's a network of caves up there, used to be a few goblins there but now there are hundreds and worse things as well. I went up there to check it out myself. Seems like there's orcs, bugbears, and goblins crawling all over the hills. That's how I got me knee hurt, too. Bastard goblins ambushed me before I could find out what was going on.~ 
@21 = ~So what makes you think that the cult is involved?~
@22 = ~Long as I've been recuperatin' here, with me ale, that lad Ander across the Inn won't let up with his wolf-man talk. He's daft, y'see. Thinks there's wolf-men all around.~
@23 = ~Join ye? Well that's a right flatterin' offer. But with this bum knee o' mine I'm laid up a while. Tell you what, though: I'm always happy to share information. If ye find anything, tell me all about it. Two heads're better than one, eh?~
@24 = ~Maybe you can help me another way. I need gold for expenses.~
@25 = ~Two reasons. First, the beasts started to gather just when the plague hit Neverwinter. Second, there was a man leading the goblins who attacked me. That ain't a typical thing. Maybe the man was a cultist. Maybe not. Either way, my gut is tellin' me that the picture ain't right.~ 
@26 = ~I'll be sure to check it out.~
@27 = ~I have another question.~
@28 = ~Well, I should like to <GIRLBOY>, but I need all me gold to feed meself and keep a roof over me head. No income comin' in with a bum leg and all.~ 
@29 = ~All right, I would like to ask you more questions though.~
@30 = ~Lady Aribeth has commanded me to raise funds to assist the search.~
@31 = ~You had better hand over some gold, before I have to perform surgery to remove that diseased leg.~
@32 = ~Listen, then. If you find anything, you tell me. Two heads are better than one and all that. We adventurers need to stick together to find those bastards and punish 'em! Best o' luck to you! I wish my knee was healed up so I could come with!~
@33 = ~What can I do for you?~
@34 = ~To help catch the cult ye say, well I suppose I could give ye 100 gold pieces. I'll find some way to feed meself. Just remember me generosity when ye come back. I want to hear what be goin' on, what with me bein' unable to get around proper.~ 
@35 = ~I be tellin' ye, I can't be givin' gold away when I be wounded like this. I'd be more than happy to help ye puzzle this quest out though. You just come back when somethin' happens and I'll try to help ye out.~
@36 = ~The leg is hurt, it doesn't need... oh, I get it. Well, if it's gonna be that way, I guess I could come up with a little gold. Here's 100 gold, but that's all I have. Just remember me generosity when ye come back. I want to hear what be goin' on, what with me bein' unable to get around proper.~ 
@37 = ~You there! Any progress? If only this knee o' mine weren't banged, I'd be out wit' ye!~ 
@38 = ~Back off... somehow I think that you intend to claim my findings as your own.~
@39 = ~I have nothing to tell you.~
@40 = ~I suspect that the cult may be based in Luskan.~
@41 = ~I have explored the caves that you mentioned. There was a cult member there who was stirring up trouble.~ 
@42 = ~Now then <GIRLBOY>, no need to get sassy. I'm just stirring up leads, as you should be... touchy, ain't you?~
@43 = ~Well, keep at it. We need to punish the ones who unleashed the plague on poor Neverwinter.~
@44 = ~Luskan, eh? Hmm, I'll have to think about that. You get back to your searchin' friend. Luskan...~
@45 = ~Just as I thought! See, you gotta trust ol' Darktongue. I'll send you down the right path every time.~ 
@46 = ~This ain't personal, friend, but it's the end just the same. It's time ol' Darktongue got hisself some glory... let's finish it!~
