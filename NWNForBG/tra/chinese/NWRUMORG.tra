@0 = ~The local cemetery is haunted by the undead at night. Bring weapons to visit Grandma or don't visit her at all. It all started after some sorcerer from the Luskan's Arcane Brotherhood was buried there.~/*这个告示版写着“小心！不死生物是永不休息的。带着武器去见奶奶或是放弃。”，署名：管理人。*/
@1 = ~In Luskan, the High Captains are at war with each other. That's why they closed the gates.~/*“为什么他们的女神希望他们自己互相征战？” 那就是他们所说的。我恨这个。*/
@2 = ~South of the Green Gryphon, the road to Port Llast became dangerous. After Luskan stopped patrolling the road, travelers began to be attacked by creatures like orcs and bugbears.

@5 = ~Five dangerous criminals have escaped from Waterdeep's prison. It's doubtful, but still possible, that they went straight here. There's a minotaur who's taken up residence here, locked himself in his room and won't come out, only demanding food and ale. So I wondered if he's a criminal, he looks like a bandit.~/*“是什么使你认为我是从别的地方逃出来的？” 我现在已经有其中一颗宝石了。 这个护身符一面有魔像的图样，另外一面刻着意为“守护”的符文。 你知道恶魔长的什么样子吗？*/
@6 = ~There's been no word from Charwood for a long time. Rumor has it there's a lot of undead, ghosts, it's creepy.~/*在这个时侯你无事可做。 “你说大门外面有不死生物？”*/
@7 = ~Neverwinter Wood is best not to go there. They say the animals there have gone wild, even the deer and rabbits are attacking everyone.~
