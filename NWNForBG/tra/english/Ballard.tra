@0 = ~NP: Hello. My name is Ballard. I'm a tracker, looking for someone interested in a dangerous mission. Perhaps you are interested?~ [BALLA052] /*Hello there <PRO_GIRLBOY>. My name is Ballard. I am a ranger and I am looking for someone interested in a dangerous mission. Might you be interested?*/
@1 = ~Yes. My name is <CHARNAME>. What do you need?~
@2 = ~I might be. Why do you ask?~
@3 = ~Not right now thanks. Goodbye.~
@4 = ~NP: Well, friend, this is not exactly what I need; too many lives at stake.~ /*Well friend, it's not just what I need; there are many lives at stake.*/
@5 = ~People's lives are at stake. I hope you change your mind.~
@6 = ~NP: Something has been unsettled in the Neverwinter Forest lately. It began with the fact that travelers who came from there told about usually peaceful animals that attacked them for no reason. Then farmers and lumberjacks began to disappear. The animals attacked everyone, even the rangers and druids who were there to help the forest. I'm afraid that if we don't get help, entire villages near the Forest could be destroyed.~ /*Then farmers and woodcutters began to disappear. The animals have been attacking everyone, even the rangers and druids that are there to help the forest. I fear that without assistance, whole villages near the Wood might be destroyed.*/
@7 = ~I don't like attacking animals, so what am I supposed to do about it?~
@8 = ~What can I do to be of assistance?~
@9 = ~That doesn't really interest me right now.~
@10 = ~NP: There is a grove of druids here, in which they are now trying to find out what is wrong. Their leader is Aaville. He sent three of his best druids into the forest in search of a clue, but no one has heard of them for a long time. It is possible that the druids returned while I was away, but Aaville may still need your help to save the Forest. If you're brave enough, find Aaville in the grove at the edge of the forest.~ /*There is a grove of druids that are trying to find out what is wrong. The leader is Aawill. He sent three of his best druids into the Wood in search of clues, but nobody has heard from them in a while.*/
@11 = ~I guess I should go check it out then.~
@12 = ~Where is the Neverwinter Wood from here?~
@13 = ~Are they offering a reward?~
@14 = ~I'm really not interested. Thanks anyway.~
@15 = ~I hope to hear from you again, when the forest is returned to its natural state. In the meantime, should you need any nature related supplies, I would be happy to show you my wares.~
@16 = ~I don't need any supplies, thanks.~
@17 = ~I would like to see your wares.~
@18 = ~NP: Neverwinter Forest: Spirit of the Forest Rumor has it that the Spirit of the Neverwinter Forest is not feeling well for some reason. Archdruid Aavill, who leads the conclave, will be able to tell you more about this.~ /*There are rumors that the Spirit of the Neverwinter Wood has somehow come to harm. No doubt Aawill, an Archdruid who maintains a conclave there, will know more.*/
@19 = ~Then Mielikki speed your way <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>.~
@20 = ~The Wood is to the east of here. Be sure you stop by the grove before you enter the forest proper. Aawill might have some more information for you.~
@21 = ~Well, that's not really up to me to say, but I've never known Aawill to be stingy when it came to rewarding other people's assistance.~
@22 = ~Welcome back. What can I do for you now?~ [BALLA051]
@23 = ~What were you needing help with again?~
@24 = ~Where is the Neverwinter Wood?~
@25 = ~NP: I want to see your products.~ /*I need to see what you have in stock, druid.*/
@26 = ~Nothing. Bye bye.~
@27 = ~It is possible that the druids have returned in my absence, but Aawill could still use your assistance in preserving the Wood. If you are brave enough, seek Aawill in the grove near the forest's edge.~
@28 = ~NP: All clear, I'm leaving.~ /*Fine, I'll go.*/
@29 = ~NP: Of course, choose.~ /*Sure. Hit me.*/
@30 = ~My friend! You have returned victorious. It gladdens my heart to know that there are heroes like you in the world.~ [BALLA050]
@31 = ~Thank you. Farewell.~
@32 = ~The news I have heard is sad, yet I am sure you did your best. Is there anything I can do for you?~
