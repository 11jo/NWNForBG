@0 = ~Oh, my! You don't strike me as the type of <MANWOMAN> who would be one of Maugrim's followers. You're not, are you?~ [NWDELT50] 
@1 = ~Are you a prisoner here?~
@2 = ~Stand back! I'll have no tricks out of you!~
@3 = ~No, I'm certainly not one of the cultists.~
@4 = ~Aye. Maugrim had me thrown in here for refusing to join his cause. My name is Deltagar Zhelhund... a former Overwizard of the brotherhood. Tell me... might you be able to free me from this cell?~
@5 = ~How do I know that this isn't some ruse?~
@6 = ~I'd appreciate some information, first.~
@7 = ~What reward would I get for letting you go?~
@8 = ~Would you be able to find your way out on your own?~
@9 = ~I'm not here to rescue you.~
@10 = ~Oh, I'm quite harmless in this cell. We designed it especially to hold casters... though I never thought I would be held in one. My name is Deltagar Zhelhund, and Maugrim has imprisoned me for refusing to join him. Am I free, now?~
@11 = ~That is quite a relief, then. My name is Deltagar Zhelhund, and Maugrim has kept me prisoner here for refusing to join his cause. Might I be free to go, now, <SIRMAAM>?~
@12 = ~A ruse? Do you believe Maugrim stocks his cells with his cultists on the off chance that someone might invade the Host Tower and free them? Please, <SIRMAAM>... all I want to do is get out of here.~
@13 = ~I don't trust you. Time to die!~
@14 = ~I shall tell you whatever I can. I admit, however, that I know little of what has occurred since Maugrim put me in the cell.~
@15 = ~What happened here in the tower?~
@16 = ~Tell me what you know about the cult.~
@17 = ~All right. I'm done with the questions.~
@18 = ~I have nothing to reward you with. Maugrim has no doubt removed my blood link to the teleporters, so I can't even make you a runestone. I could tell you what I know, however, if you wish.~
@19 = ~Yes, I could use some information.~
@20 = ~You're of no use to me, then.~
@21 = ~Why not join me and fight Maugrim?~
@22 = ~Yes... yes, one can teleport out of the towers. Just not into them. I can leave... and return to strike back at that fiend, Maugrim, as soon as possible.~
@23 = ~Then you can go.~
@24 = ~I can't trust you not to betray me. Sorry, but you die.~
@25 = ~Then... you will let me leave?~
@26 = ~I never said that. You could betray me... I'll have to kill you.~
@27 = ~Yes, go on. I've got better things to do, here.~ 
@28 = ~No! No!! Someone help me!!~
@29 = ~Isn't it obvious? Maugrim has taken over the Host Tower and forced Archmage Arklem to flee. It was not done without a great battle... but we have lost.~
@30 = ~How did Maugrim manage to take over?~
@31 = ~What does he want the Tower for?~
@32 = ~Who is this Arklem? Do you know where he is?~
@33 = ~The fighting appears to be still ongoing.~
@34 = ~I want to know something else.~
@35 = ~Maugrim has not recruited his followers in a regular sense. He has some hold over them... not mind control, but certainly something that goes beyond mere worship. They are all loyal to him and the strange power he serves in the most fanatic sense. What their end purpose might be I can't imagine.~ 
@36 = ~What are their demands?~
@37 = ~Tell me about Maugrim.~
@38 = ~Who are Maugrim's supporters, here?~
@39 = ~Where do I find Maugrim?~
@40 = ~I... I would help you, stranger, if I could. My first allegiance is to the Brotherhood, however. My obligation is to seek out those who remain, not to fight Maugrim by your side.~
@41 = ~Why would you tell me that?~
@42 = ~So you won't help me, then?~
@43 = ~Then forget it. Leave, while you can.~
@44 = ~Then I am forced to kill you, I guess.~
@45 = ~Thank you. Thankfully I can still teleport away from here... and return to fight Maugrim later. I wish you well, <SIRMAAM>.~
@46 = ~Maugrim came to us many months ago, though I do not know from where. He claimed to have uncovered some mysterious power... power that he would share with us. He was very secretive about the nature of this power, of course, but Arklem was too eager to care. Maugrim joined the Brotherhood and began training students. We did not know it, but each of the students he taught surely fell under his sway. They joined him in worshipping this power of his, and his cult spread.~ 
@47 = ~Well, on the surface it would look like he wants to use the resources of the wizards in some great war he is concocting. He intends to invade Neverwinter, of that I have little doubt even if I don't know what he's done in recent weeks. It's not power that he seeks specifically, however... something is in Neverwinter that he seeks.~ 
@48 = ~What is this power that he worships?~
@49 = ~What is he looking for?~
@50 = ~Arklem was once the Archmage Arcane of the Brotherhood. He fled just as Maugrim began his campaign... none of us were even aware he had fled. I haven't a clue as to where he might be. He is plotting, no doubt, to remove Maugrim from his usurped position... if that is even possible.~ 
@51 = ~Is it? When I was imprisoned a week ago, it was obvious that we had lost. If there is still fighting, then it is out of desperation and nothing else. Before I was captured, I made sure that the teleporter dweomer was disrupted... and I engineered the release of some of our more dangerous experiments. That may have kept Maugrim busy, but make no mistake: he controls the Host Tower completely.~ 
@52 = ~What do you want to know?~
@53 = ~Ultimately, Maugrim intends to tear apart the north in search of these 'words of power' that his mistress wishes. What the words of power are, exactly, or what their use might be... that I don't know. Maugrim is desperate to find them, however. I believe he may already have one. There is another in Neverwinter... or so I surmise... and that is the reason he wishes to invade it.~ 
@54 = ~Maugrim... has great power. I thought, at first, that surely he must be a sorcerer or wizard. I am not certain of that anymore. He worships a powerful being that he doesn't like to talk about much... but it gives him much in return. Does this make him a cleric? Again I do not know. He is an intense and proud man, though. He believes his course is right and will allow nothing to stop him. Beware of getting in his way... you see where that brought us.~ 
@55 = ~From what I gathered, Maugrim has the support of over half of the wizards in the Host Tower. Mostly the young ones... but they have considerable numbers. I suspect he has sent most of them out throughout the North to search for his precious words... but no doubt there are many left here. I heard that Valinda Shadowmantle joined his side before I fell. If that's true, she will be of great use to him, she being an Overwizard herself.~ 
@56 = ~Who is Valinda Shadowmantle?~
@57 = ~In Arkleth's sanctum, no doubt, atop the North Tower. Getting there will be somewhat problematic, however. If you can find Valinda Shadowmantle, I suspect that she would have a rune with access to the sanctum. It may be your only way there.~ 
@58 = ~I do not know what sort of <MANWOMAN> you are. I, myself, have done much in the name of the Brotherhood that many would consider evil. Whether you agree or not is not my concern. I will not betray my oaths... not for Maugrim, and not for you. I am grateful for your help and will certainly not betray you... but I must go my own way and help my Brethren as I can.~ 
@59 = ~I cannot. You obviously have considerable ability or you wouldn't have gotten this far... I wish you well and pray that Maugrim suffers at your hands.~
@60 = ~When Maugrim finally tipped his hand, it was too late for us to do anything but try to fight back. The Tower was his... and, along with it, Luskan.~
@61 = ~I do not know, exactly. Some old god, perhaps? A demon? He did not reveal its nature to anyone but Arklem, and Arklem was very excited about the possibilities.~
@62 = ~Words of power, belonging to some ancient tongue. Maugrim claims that these 'words' are hidden in the oldest ruins of the North. I have never heard of such things, myself... and why he would think one of them might be in Neverwinter eludes me. If these words of power truly exist, one has to wonder what they might do. That, too, I don't know... but I believe it is the power he serves who wishes them and not Maugrim, himself.~ 
@63 = ~A young sorceress who was once one of Arklem's greatest supporters. She has much knowledge of the towers, which has no doubt been of benefit to Maugrim.~
@64 = ~You haven't the look of one of Maugrim's fanatics, I'll give you that. Of course, one can never be too sure...~ [NWDELT51]
@65 = ~Ahh! Why have you come? Are you another one of Maugrim's fanatics, come to torment me again?!~ [NWDELT52]
