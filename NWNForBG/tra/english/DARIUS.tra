@0 = ~Ahh! Don't eat me please!~
@1 = ~Calm down. I'm not going to eat you.~
@2 = ~MT: I don't eat people.~ /*Me not with , nope.*/
@3 = ~You... you aren't a troll are you?~
@4 = ~No. I am not a troll.~
@5 = ~Do I look like a troll?~
@6 = ~MT: Then please help me. I need to get out of here. They're coming, they want to kill me, eat me. I hear them. I hear they are coming. Don't you hear? Can't you hear the screams? They eat the rest.~ /*Then please help me. I need to get out of here. They're coming to kill me and eat me.*/
@7 = ~There aren't any screams. You don't have to worry, I'm killing the trolls.~
@8 = ~Wonderful. What am I supposed to do with a madman?~
@9 = ~MT: I don't know. I... I think not. But they are close. I hear they are coming. Don't you hear? Can't you hear the screams? They eat the rest.~ /*I can hear them. I can hear them coming. Can't you hear them? Can't you hear the screams? They're eating the others.*/
@10 = ~You? You can't kill the trolls. They killed all the guards, they'll kill you too.~
@11 = ~I've already killed a number of trolls. Now, what's your name?~
@12 = ~I can handle trolls. What is wrong with you? Have you lost your mind?~
@13 = ~MT: Crazy? I? Yes, maybe so. Maybe I made it all up myself. Maybe the other four are still alive. Maybe I never saw the trolls get in here. I'm probably wrong. The trolls didn't come here and tear the rest to pieces. They did not rip off arms and legs or gnaw at the flesh from the bones.~ /*Crazy? Me? Yes, maybe I am. Maybe I have imagined all of this. Maybe the other four are still alive. Perhaps I never saw the trolls come here.*/
@14 = ~I guess you have an excuse. Don't worry, I have already killed a number of trolls.~
@15 = ~That's horrible. They did it right in front of you?~
@16 = ~Enough whining already! I'm getting out of here, with or without you.~
@17 = ~Too many! There are too many. And just when you think you've killed one, it pulls itself back up and starts to attack again. No, we have to flee!~
@18 = ~I don't have time to escort you back to the surface, but the way should be clear.~
@19 = ~Do you want me to take you to the surface?~
@20 = ~Then it is real? No. Even Kendin? He's really dead? No. I must get out of here.~
@21 = ~Yes, I will go by myself. Then the trolls will eat you while I escape. The trolls will get you. And if they don't, the other thing will.~
@22 = ~What other thing?~
@23 = ~Whatever. Goodbye.~
@24 = ~No! The trolls will eat you. They will find you. And even if they don't, the other thing will.~
@25 = ~They're afraid of it. It's down deep. They won't go near it.~
@26 = ~Who's afraid? The trolls?~
@27 = ~What is it? Do you know?~
@28 = ~I will flee now. You will die so that I might live. Thank you.~
@29 = ~MT: Can you imagine something that would scare the trolls? They know how strong she is. We can't do anything. She will kill them and then she will kill you. I must run now! Good luck.~ /*Can you imagine something that could scare trolls? They know it is powerful. There is nothing we can do. It will kill them and then it will kill you.*/
