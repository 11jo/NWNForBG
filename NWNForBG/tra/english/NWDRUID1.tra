@0 = ~Oh, thank you for unraveling me from that cocoon! I thought I was dead for sure.~
@1 = ~I am glad I was able to find you down here. Who are you?~
@2 = ~NP: Its too dangerous for me here. Choose on your own.~ /*Come here or I'll feed you your own intestines as sausage*/
@3 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@4 = ~My name is Orlane. I am a druid who was sent by my leader Aawill to find out what is wrong with the Spirit of the Wood.~
@5 = ~I have met Aawill. My name is <CHARNAME> and I was sent to rescue you.~
@6 = ~NP: I am from the team<CHARNAME> . Aaville sent us to look for you.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. Aawill sent me to find you.*/
@7 = ~NP: Thats exactly what Im doing. What can you tell me about the current situation?~ /*No, but I'm working on it. What can you tell me about the situation?*/
@8 = ~No. Some of the other druids have gone missing too. Do you know where they might be?~
@9 = ~So you're one of the druids I was looking for. Glad I found you.~
@10 = ~I will in a moment, but for now I just need to clear my head of the spider's poison. Could you please sit with me until I'm up to leaving? It shouldn't take too long.~
@11 = ~Please don't be long. I can't stand the touch of these spider webs.~
@12 = ~Thank the balance for Aawill. He is a strong leader.~
@13 = ~So how did you get captured?~
@14 = ~What were you doing down here?~
@15 = ~NP: Well, obviously something very bad is going on with the Spirit of the Forest. It looks like hes gone crazy. Usually the Spirit enters the Forest and exits through the pond under the waterfall, but as I found out, no one has seen him for a long time.~ /*Well, it is obvious that something is severely wrong with the Spirit of the Wood. It seems to have gone crazy.*/
@16 = ~Tell me more about this pool.~
@17 = ~You mean there's a cave under the pool?~
@18 = ~NP: I have no idea. We split up to find out as much as possible, and agreed to meet later in the grove. As you know, it didnt work for me. I guess others do too. I wonder if they managed to find out more than me?~ /*As you know, I never made it. I guess the others didn't either. I wonder if they found out more than I did?*/
@19 = ~Tell me what you've learned about the Spirit of the Wood.~
@20 = ~So how did you get down here?~
@21 = ~I hope you are feeling better now. You should get going.~
@22 = ~NP: Im glad you managed to find me too. If so, Aaville must have sent you. Praise the balance for Aaville. He is a good leader.~ /*I am glad you found me too. That must mean that Aawill sent you.*/
@23 = ~I was sent into the Wood to find out why the creatures were attacking everyone. I tried talking to a deer in one clearing, but the poor thing's mind was so confused that it attacked me.~
@24 = ~You were attacked by a deer? I've never heard of such a thing.~
@25 = ~Ha! You got your butt kicked by a deer?~
@26 = ~The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.~
@27 = ~Why didn't you go into it?~
@28 = ~What do you mean another realm?~
@29 = ~NP: No, its like a portal. A pond is something like an entrance to another reality, where the Spirit most often lives. However, I have no idea what it looks like.~ /*The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.*/
@30 = ~I should be fine now. Again, I can't thank you enough for your assistance. Good luck.~
@31 = ~It came right at me and I tried to dodge, but it caught me in the side with a hoof. It reared up to strike me again, but then it suddenly turned and ran off.~
@32 = ~I got up to try and follow, but then I heard a soft chittering sound behind me. I turned around, but before I even saw what was happening, something soft with long hairy legs and mandibles leapt on top of me.~
@33 = ~The spiders attacked you on the surface?~
@34 = ~Surprised twice? You were really alert for danger, weren't you?~
@35 = ~It's not funny. I would have been ready for an attack if it had been a wolf or a bear, but nobody expects to be attacked by a deer.~
@36 = ~NP: I dont know much about this pond, except for a few legends. I know that no living creature can penetrate the portal into another reality. As an old druid I met once said, a portal exists between the realities of life and death. Spirit is a kind of half-living entity, so it can pass through the portal at will, but we cant.~ /*According to an old druid I once met, the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so it can go through the portal at will, but we can't.*/
@37 = ~So now what am I supposed to do?~
@38 = ~It's another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.~
@39 = ~NP: At first I didnt even know what it was. I felt this creature bit me, and suddenly the whole world started spinning. I woke up already here, all wrapped up. I had no choice but to wait for another bite, and then you come and set me free. Once again, thank you very much. Now I need to find my druid companions and think about what we can do about the Spirit of the Forest.~ /*I was just waiting to feel another bite when you came along and set me free. Again, thank you so very much. Now I need to find my companion druids and see if we can figure out what to do about the Spirit of the Wood.*/
@40 = ~I had to kill the Spirit of the Wood, so the problem is resolved.~
@41 = ~NP: I managed to heal the Spirit of the Forest. Now you can safely return to the grove.~ /*I have cured the Spirit of the Wood. You may return to the other druids in peace.*/
@42 = ~NP: Do you know what happened to the other druids sent out to find you?~ /*Do you know what happened to the other druids who were searching for answers?*/
@43 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@44 = ~I was a little distracted at the moment. You get kicked by a deer and see how you feel.~
@45 = ~I don't know. Maybe if you find the other druids that were searching, they could help you. Otherwise you might want to talk to a nymph. Maybe they haven't gone crazy like the animals.~
@46 = ~You did what? Why would... how could... you idiot! Without the Spirit, the Wood will never truly recover.~
@47 = ~I did what I had to do!~
@48 = ~NP: Be careful with accusations. No one knows that you managed to stay alive...~ /*Watch your insults. Nobody else knows I found you... if you take my meaning.*/
@49 = ~NP: Glory to the forces! What wonderful news. Your name will be sung by the wind for such a heroic deed. I will do my best to let everyone know about your feat,<LADYLORD> . Now, if youll excuse me, Ill leave.~ /*I shall be sure that others hear of your deed, good <PRO_LADYLORD>. Now if you will excuse me, I should be off.*/
@50 = ~I'm sure you think you did, but there had to be another path. Probably a harder path, but nothing worth doing is ever easy.~
@51 = ~You weren't there, so why don't you keep your judgments to yourself.~
@52 = ~I am terribly sorry for the damage I have done, but you don't know what it was like.~
@53 = ~I... I'm sorry. You did free me, so I guess I should be grateful. I just don't think you realize how much damage has been done.~
@54 = ~Time to get moving. You can make it out on your own?~
@55 = ~NP: Well... thats probably not the point. I... Im really sorry. It was only thanks to you that I managed to free myself, so I should probably say thank you. Its just that I dont think you fully understand the damage thats been done because of you.~ /*I... I'm sorry. You did free me, so I guess I should be grateful. I just don't think you realize how much damage has been done.*/
@56 = ~You came back. Can I leave yet?~
@57 = ~Why don't you tell me your story?~
@58 = ~NP: Can you get out of here on your own?~ /*Can you get away from here safely on your own?*/
@59 = ~I love nature, but not spiders. Not anymore. Thanks again for the rescue.~
