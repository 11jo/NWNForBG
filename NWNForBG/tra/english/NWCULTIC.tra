@0 = ~What?! Who are you!? One of these vacuous automatons? You may as well be dead! All of you! Soon your endless story won't matter!~
@1 = ~Who are you? You are not from Charwood?~
@2 = ~Settle down. What are you talking about?~
@3 = ~I don't have time for this. Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Oh no, I'm not talking to more of you. I know what you are! I kill you, and then you're back! It never ends! See, you tell your sorry tale to me, but then you'll forget it! Why!? YOU'RE NOT HERE!!!~ /*Oh no, I'm not talking to more of you. I know what you are! I kill you, and then you're back! It never ends!*/
@5 = ~What do you mean I'm not here?~
@6 = ~I seek a cult responsible for plague in Neverwinter.~
@7 = ~Who are you?~
@8 = ~Time? This place is full of nothing BUT time! I killed them all! But they came back! I'll kill you too, a million times over if I must!!!~
@9 = ~Why am I even talking to you!? You aren't here, they aren't here, and I'm beginning to wonder about myself. What about me? Am I... here?~
@10 = ~You - You seek a cult? Plague in Neverwinter?? That's recent news, that's news from the outside! I know about that! You know about that! No, it can't be! It's a trick!! I know all about it but I'm not telling you anything... It's mine! My secret!~ /*You - You seek a cult? Plague in Neverwinter?? That's recent news, that's news from the outside! I know about that! You know about that!*/
@11 = ~Look, it's important that you tell me.~
@12 = ~What is it to you?! You're not here. No one is here! It's all a lie! How can I find what I'm looking for if nothing is actually here? HOW?!~
@13 = ~What are you looking for?~
@14 = ~What does it matter if I tell a ghost? You'll forget it before I'm even halfway done telling it! Desther and the plague were just the start of things. The Cult of the Eye has bigger goals. I should know, they sent me here to look for something...~ /*Desther and the plague were just the start of things. The Cult of the Eye has bigger goals. I should know, they sent me here to look for something...*/
@15 = ~Where is the cult based? Who's in charge?~
@16 = ~It's very important that I find it. Very important! But it's a secret - I'm not telling you! Go away!~
@17 = ~You can tell me. Maybe I can help.~
@18 = ~We follow the Great One, Maugrim, at the heart of Luskan. Even he is but a vessel for powers more ancient... There, I've told you. Now it's time I killed you, ghost. Again and again and again! It'll be good training for what is to come...~ /*There, I've told you. Now it's time I killed you, ghost. Again and again and again! It'll be good training for what is to come...*/
@19 = ~You ask too many questions, ghost... I think, unlike the others, you might not return when I kill you.~
@20 = ~Help? Yes, use the old to find the ancient, the mad to find the maddening! The Cult of the Eye, they sent me here to find something, an ancient artifact of great importance! They sent me to this madhouse!~ /*The Cult of the Eye, they sent me here to find something, an ancient artifact of great importance! They sent me to this madhouse!*/
@21 = ~The cult? The one from Neverwinter?~
@22 = ~Desther and the plague were just the start of things. The Cult of the Eye has bigger goals. I should know, they sent me here to look for something...~
