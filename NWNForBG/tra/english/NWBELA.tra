@0 = ~Why, hullo there, darling. Come for a bit of fun, have you?~ [NWBEL051]
@1 = ~What kind of place is this?~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~This? This is a palace of pleasure, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. There are men and women who can take your mind away from the terrible world outside... for a time.~
@6 = ~How do I go about seeing one of them?~
@7 = ~They work here of their own free will?~
@8 = ~I can't say I approve.~
@9 = ~My name is Bela, darling. I keep my boys and girls safe and the customers happy. If you're ever unhappy, you come see me... I'll change your mind, you'll see.~
@10 = ~That's what you're doing already, isn't it? Ha ha! Nevermind me... you go right ahead.~
@11 = ~Tell me about what's going on in Luskan.~
@12 = ~How can you run this place with all the fighting going on?~
@13 = ~Leaving so soon? Be careful, then, sweet thing.~
@14 = ~NP: Ha ha! You will have to speak to them in person. If they have time and they like you... Then the two of you can do something. All my girls and boys are upstairs. You can go up there if you like. If you stay down here... be careful around these people.~ /*All of my girls and boys spend their time upstairs. You can go up there, if you like. If you stay down here... well, do be careful around some of these men.*/
@15 = ~Who are these men?~
@16 = ~NP: Well, of course, dear. There are far worse ways to earn a living in Luskan than spending time in luxury and pleasant company. Of course, if you dont believe me, you can ask them yourself. Im just asking you not to cause problems.~ /*Naturally they do, darling. There are far worse ways in Luskan to make a living than to spend your time surrounded by luxury and fine company.*/
@17 = ~NP: Ha ha! Actually,<MALEFEMALE> , no one said that your approval is required. The door is such an amazing thing, through which you can not only enter, but also exit, do you agree with me? Oh, by the way... Take a good look at the stone on this ring that my last gentleman gave me? What do you say, huh?~ /*Ha ha! Well, my dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>, nobody said that you had to. The marvelous thing about a door is that it's as good for going as it is for coming, wouldn't you agree?*/
@18 = ~My goodness! It's huge!~
@19 = ~NP: Not a bad thing.~ /*That's the good stuff!*/
@20 = ~Big deal.~
@21 = ~Now you have me at a disadvantage, however. Might I know your name, hmm?~
@22 = ~I'm called <CHARNAME>.~
@23 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@24 = ~NP: I dont want to give my name.~ /*Me not want tell you name.*/
@25 = ~NP: My name wont tell you anything.~ /*Me not need nothing right now.*/
@26 = ~NP: Youre not from here<CHARNAME> , Truth? I like it in men. I can caress you myself. Its not here and its not there. Is there anything Bela can do to help you? Weve got gin, weve got wine, and weve got pickles... Anything you want.~ /*But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.*/
@27 = ~NP: Mmm... Cucumbers?~ /*Err... pickles?*/
@28 = ~I'll look around.~
@29 = ~NP: You have a nice name, girl. Dont say it to those rude people downstairs or theyll get drunk and start singing dirty ballads about you for hours. Believe me, it will. Its not here and its not there. Is there anything Bela can do to help you? Weve got gin, weve got wine, and weve got pickles... Anything you want.~ /*Sweet name you have there, girl. Don't let the brutes down here know it, or you'll be hearing it in drunken ballads for hours. Trust me on that.*/
@30 = ~NP: Thats a very big question, dear. In short, one day, the High Captains suddenly decided to find out which of them could remain the one and only High Captain, and started this slaughter in the city. I think boys will always be boys. Although I bet you wanted to know something more, right?~ /*That is a mighty big question, darling. The simple answer is that the High Captains one day decided to see which of them would be the one and only High Captain and began to kill each other and the city.*/
@31 = ~Tell me more about these High Captains.~
@32 = ~When did all this fighting begin?~
@33 = ~Isn't there anyone who can put a stop to it?~
@34 = ~NP: I would like to ask another question.~ /*I want to ask you something else.*/
@35 = ~NP: I dont have much choice, dear. The High Captains want their people to enjoy this place... So they make sure we dont shut down. And besides... A very happy soldier is much, much better than a very unhappy soldier. Do you understand me, dear? Of course, we have to give each High Captain a lot of gold in order to keep peace, but still we live easier than many.~ /*It's not like I have much of a choice, darling. The High Captains all want a place that keeps their men happy... so they make sure that we don't close down.*/
@36 = ~NP: Pfft... Most of these brutes are soldiers of High Captain Kurt or High Captain Baram. They obey their commanders and are constantly at war. I think thats all I can do to distract them, otherwise they will immediately start fighting and destroy my sweet home. It will be much, much easier for all of us when these High Captains finally kill each other once and for all. Mmm... I probably shouldnt say that. What do you think of them, dear?~ /*It'll be far, far better for us all when those High Captains get it all over with and kill each other once and for all. Mmm... but perhaps I shouldn't talk so. What do you think of them, darling?*/
@37 = ~I think I agree with you.~
@38 = ~I could not care less, one way or the other.~
@39 = ~I support Kurth.~
@40 = ~I support Baram.~
@41 = ~NP: Look, baby, *gods* have nothing to do with it! But weve gone off topic. I remember you were very unhappy. Is there anything else you wanted, dear?~ /*But we're getting off the topic. You were busy disapproving, as I recall. Something else you wanted, then, darling?*/
@42 = ~NP: Well, you dont have to be so crooked, honey. If I say that it is a stone, then it is indeed a stone. Hes pretty cute. Like my ex, and by the way, I donâ€™t fall for cheap stuff. But weve gone off topic. I remember you were very unhappy. Is there anything else you wanted, dear?~ /*Don't get your leathers in a bunch, sweetie. When I say it's a rock, I mean it's a rock. Looks pretty, though. So did my beau, but I don't date cheap men.*/
@43 = ~NP: It cost a lot... my cavalier. After he borrowed so much money, I was told that his tongue was found in the Ten Cities and his toes were found in Atkatla. I know its very sad, but you can get over it. But weve gone off topic. I remember you were very unhappy. Is there anything else you wanted, dear?~ /*It was a big deal... to my beau. After borrowing all that gold, I hear you'll find his tongue in Ten Towns and his toes in Athkatla. Sad story, I know, but you'll get over it.*/
@44 = ~NP: Ooooh, how adorable! I like it in men. I dont think youre going to fall under the table without really doing anything, right? Its not here and its not there. Is there anything Bela can do to help you? Weve got gin, weve got wine, and weve got pickles... Anything you want.~ /*But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.*/
@45 = ~NP: You have good manners, girl. If you ever decide to change your profession, come and talk to me. Just dont be childish: jewelry is always good. Its not here and its not there. Is there anything Bela can do to help you? Weve got gin, weve got wine, and weve got pickles... Anything you want.~ /*You got the manners, girl. You ever decide to change professions, you come and talk to me. Don't kid yourself: the jewelry is fabulous.*/
@46 = ~NP: Dark and mysterious. Hmmm, you give me goosebumps, honey. I can solve a lot of things for you, murrrrrmeow! Its not here and its not there. Is there anything Bela can do to help you? Weve got gin, weve got wine, and weve got pickles... Anything you want.~ /*But that's neither here nor there. Is there something that Bela can do for you? We have satin, we have wine, we have pickles... anything you like.*/
@47 = ~NP: Mmmm, I think the boys will like you. Teach them good manners and show them whos in charge... Then theyll be white and fluffy, trust me. Its not here and its not there. Is there anything Bela can do to help you? Weve got gin, weve got wine, and weve got pickles... Anything you want.~ /*Mmmm, the boys are going to love you, I see. Teach them manners and show them who's boss... you'll have them eating out of your hand, trust me.*/
@48 = ~It's for the gnomes. They like their pickles sour and their women tall. Don't ask me why.~
@49 = ~Don't get lost, then, darling. We once found a halfling in the cellar after a week, poor fellow. He was still smiling, but that's a different story.~
@50 = ~NP: Yes, you have to think. Well, at first there were five of them, of course. Most of them died or fled... Really, who knows? Only Kurt and Baram remained, the most disgusting guys, God forbid you meet them. It will be much, much easier for all of us when these High Captains finally kill each other once and for all. Then my poor boys and girls will be safe.~ /*Well, let's see. There used to be five of them, naturally. Most of them have died off or run off... who can really tell anymore? Only Kurth and Baram are left, two of the nastiest fellas you never want to come across.*/
@51 = ~Hmm... only a few weeks ago. Has it only been that long? Yes, I think it has. Simply amazing. It was about the same time that we heard about the plague in Neverwinter, I think.~
@52 = ~Them wizards in the Host Tower could, I suppose. Looks like they don't want to.~
@53 = ~Tell me about these wizards.~
@54 = ~Sure thing, sugar.~
@55 = ~NP: Heres a smart one<GIRLBOY> . It immediately seemed to me that you are just gold, at first sight. You know... if youre so insistent, I might suggest talking to Rain. This is one of my girls upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~ /*You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She's one of my girls upstairs.*/
@56 = ~NP: Heres a smart one<GIRLBOY> . It immediately seemed to me that you are just gold, at first sight. You know... if thats the case, Id suggest talking to Oret. This is one of my boys upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~ /*You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He's one of my boys upstairs.*/
@57 = ~Ha ha! You must have walked into the city blindfolded, then! You go ahead and be mercenary if you like, darling... I like you that way.~
@58 = ~Me want asks something else.~
@59 = ~NP: Yes? Well... I guess. Kurt, at least, is more well-mannered. Although sparkling wine still makes you drunk, honey. You know... if youre so insistent, I might suggest talking to Rain. This is one of my girls upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~ /*You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She's one of my girls upstairs.*/
@60 = ~NP: Yes? Well... I guess. Kurt, at least, is more well-mannered. Although sparkling wine still makes you drunk, honey. You know... if thats the case, Id suggest talking to Oret. This is one of my boys upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~ /*You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He's one of my boys upstairs.*/
@61 = ~NP: This Baram reminds me of a slippery little rat, really... But maybe its just me being so stupid. You know... if youre so insistent, I might suggest talking to Rain. This is one of my girls upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~ /*You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Rhaine. She's one of my girls upstairs.*/
@62 = ~NP: This Baram reminds me of a slippery little rat, really... But maybe its just me being so stupid. You know... if thats the case, Id suggest talking to Oret. This is one of my boys upstairs. Shhh... Dont ask me why honey. Just trust me.~ /*You know... since you feel the way you do, you might want to go and talk to Oreth. He's one of my boys upstairs.*/
@63 = ~NP: Oh you know. These people are from the Brotherhood of the Sacraments, who live in their tower on the island. They seem to be powerful, but no one knows how much. A bridge leads to their island, but no one can cross it. And they dont come here. Thats all.~ /*Oh, you know. Them Arcane Brotherhood fellas who live in their tower on the island. They're supposed to be powerful, but nobody knows much.*/
@64 = ~NP: Pfft... Most of these brutes are soldiers of High Captain Kurt or High Captain Baram. They obey their commanders and are constantly at war. I think thats all I can do to distract them, otherwise they will immediately start fighting and destroy my sweet home. It will be much, much easier for all of us when these High Captains finally kill each other once and for all. Mmm... I probably shouldnt say that.~ /*Hmph. Most of these brutes are soldiers for either High Captain Kurth or High Captain Baram. They take after their commanders, as well, for they fight continuously.*/
@65 = ~Hullo, darling. This is a house of refinement, I'll remind you... we'll have no trouble, now.~ [NWBEL052]
@66 = ~Hullo there, darling. Do make yourself welcome.~ [NWBEL050]
