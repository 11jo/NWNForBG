@0 = ~I am sorry, were you speaking to me? Forgive my distraction, I am worried about my husband's upcoming trial.~
@1 = ~Trial? What trial?~
@2 = ~I am representing your husband in his trial.~
@3 = ~My husband Rolgan is accused of murdering one of the Lords' Alliance soldiers. He faces execution if not saved. Forgive me, but this is difficult to talk about. Neurik at the Temple of Tyr can explain it better than I - I do not understand the ways of your justice system.~ 
@4 = ~Representing my husband? I am sorry, but the ways of your justice system are unfamiliar to we people of the Black Lion Tribe. Are you a friend or foe? The priest Neurik said I would have to answer the questions put to me with complete honesty... it was as if he *expected* me to lie! He knows nothing about the honor of our tribe. Ask away, I have nothing to hide.~ 
@5 = ~Tell me what happened the night Griff was killed.~
@6 = ~My husband returned home late. He had been drinking, but there was something else. He seemed... different. As if more than alcohol were at work in his mind. When he told me he had gambled away the heirlooms of our family, precious stones sanctified by the priests of Uthgar, I knew something was very wrong. He was not in his right mind, or he would never have wagered these sacred stones on a game of chance.~ 
@7 = ~Gambling and alcohol are a dangerous combination.~
@8 = ~Please go on.~
@9 = ~I'll be going now.~
@10 = ~I know my husband, and he is no irresponsible drunkard! Something happened to him, something more sinister than mere alcohol! Of course I have no proof but I know it's true all the same.~
@11 = ~I sent him to ask this man Griff to return the heirlooms. We offered to pay him gold in exchange. It would have been far more than he could ever sell the heirlooms for. Their religious significance to the Black Lion tribe far exceeds their material worth.~
@12 = ~As you wish. Should you need to speak to me again I shall be here in the village, awaiting the trial summons from Neurik at the temple.~
@13 = ~But the soldier attacked my husband, and Rolgan was forced to kill Griff to preserve his own life. He fled to the Temple seeking sanctuary, a mob of Griff's enraged friends close on his heels.~
@14 = ~Anything else?~
@15 = ~Please, help my husband. They are portraying him as a drunken, pagan savage. This is how they view all the Uthgardt. We are a noble people, but if Rolgan is convicted the hurtful stereotype will only get stronger. I wish I could be of more help, but all I can do is pray Uthgar grants you wisdom in this matter.~ 
@16 = ~The justice of the Lord's Alliance is true justice. My husband's trial is over and he is no longer accused of his crime! We are together once more. I am grateful to you, <CHARNAME>, for you have have returned the sun to my sky. Forever you shall be counted as a friend of the Black Lion tribe of the Uthgardt people.~ 
@17 = ~My husband is dead, the sun in my sky has fallen and my spirit is swallowed by the dark night. I grieve and pray to Uthgar to lift up his soul, but in my mouth the words are hollow. The servants of Tyr defiled his body, mounting him on a stake outside their temple in a perverse act they call justice. And they dare to call us savages? Leave me to my mourning... I only want to be left alone.~ 
@18 = ~I am here. Ask your questions.~
@19 = ~Neither my husband nor I would ever commit vile murder. We Uthgardt are an honorable people!~
@20 = ~Yes, but he wouldn't have killed that man!~
@21 = ~I'm ready for your questions, <LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>.~
@22 = ~Tell me why you sent your husband to see Griff.~
@23 = ~Tell me about the significance of the heirlooms your husband had gambled away.~
@24 = ~Do you think your husband is on trial here simply because he is an Uthgardt?~
@25 = ~I have no more questions for Vanda.~
@26 = ~I told Rolgan to go speak with Griff... To beg him to return the heirlooms he had taken from us. To appeal to Griff's sense of decency. My husband is no killer. He only went back because I sent him there to talk with Griff.~
@27 = ~These are more than just heirlooms. They are artifacts of great religious significance to the Black Lion tribe. Their value is greater than mere money. Why, they mean more than life itself to the worshippers of Uthgar!~
@28 = ~You people hate the Uthgardt! For generations the Lords' Alliance has persecuted us because we were different! You are nothing but a bunch of racists!~
