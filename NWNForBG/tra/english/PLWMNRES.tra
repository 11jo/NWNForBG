@0 = ~NP: My husband is going to sea right now. Please come back tomorrow morning, I'll have fresh fish.~ /*Oh. All right then. Uh... please close the door behind you... ?*/
@1 = ~NP: Want to buy fish? I always have the freshest fish on sale. Check out this bass right here, isn't it huge?~ /*Maybe. The name's Gam and I'm here for the competition, and that should be enough for anyone.*/
@2 = ~NP: I supply fish to the tavern here, I can sell to you. Would you like to buy?~ /*Me want to know what you think about Aribeth betraying everyone. Why she do it?*/
@3 = ~NP: Damn cats! They come to me from all over Port Llast to smell fish. They're just trying to steal a fish.~ /*Oh, my father-in-law told me a few old tales from when he first cleared the land to settle here.*/
@4 = ~NP: You have to keep an eye on those kids - they're always in trouble one way or the other. If I find my son in a fishing basket again, I'll smack him with a raw fish.~ /*'Tis a fair bounty for their left ears, proof o' their death. If ye has questions about it, I can certainly answer them.*/
@5 = ~NP: Lately, my husband's catch has been a mess. It has become difficult for a poor fishmonger to make a living, that's the way things are.~ /*There has been trouble throughout the north this past while. Between plagues and werewolves a man can hardly step foot outside his inn.*/
@6 = ~NP: I'll tell you a secret... my man says he's been fishing all day... but he's always in the Union Herb, and I can't get out of this place!~ /*Thanks. Remember, he won't believe I did this if you don't have the brooch. Those Dock boys are thick skulled.*/
@7 = ~NP: Well, just go if you're not buying anything. People will think you're buying up the whole lot from the way you're standing there. FISH! СВЕ-Е-Е-ЕЖА-А-АЯ РЫ-Ы-Ы-ЫБА-А-А!~ /*"Aye, besides all o' that rot. You gots something personal against us, the way ya goes on about it."*/
