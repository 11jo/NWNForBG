@0 = ~What do you want? You here about the trial?~
@1 = ~Trial? What trial?~ 
@2 = ~Neurik sent me. I'm representing Rolgan.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~Come on, everybody's heard about it! Some Uthgardt is up for the murder of a Lords' Alliance soldier. Go speak to Neurik in the Temple of Tyr; he can fill you in.~
@5 = ~I figured as much. I ain't never been on a jury before. I seen my share of trials, but usually from the prisoner's box. What do you want to know?~
@6 = ~I'm preparing my case. What do you think about this trial?~
@7 = ~See ya.~
@8 = ~Looks to me like a bar fight gone out of hand. A few too many drinks in you and you act stupid. I've been there myself, though I ain't never killed no one. But you know what makes me mad about this case? Them people who run around saying the only reason this guy is on trial is cause he's an Uthgardt! I ain't no Uthgardt, and I've been on trial a bunch of times!~ 
@9 = ~Sounds like you're trying to keep an open mind.~
@10 = ~Is there any way I could guarantee you find Rolgan innocent?~
@11 = ~I know what it's like. Sometimes you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Could be that's what happened to this Uthgardt. I kind of hope you get him off. I'd hate to have to sentence the poor guy to execution. But I've got to give an honest verdict. Neurik says it's my duty.~ 
@12 = ~You mean like a bribe? Geez, I don't know. I could use the money, but what if Neurik found out?~
@13 = ~He'll never know. Here's 300 gold. Just make sure you find Rolgan innocent.~
@14 = ~Hey, I was just testing you. You passed. Well done.~
@15 = ~Not much more I can tell you. Hope you got what you were looking for. Good luck in the trial.~
@16 = ~Okay, you got a deal. I'll make sure Rolgan gets a not guilty vote from me but I can't make the rest of the jury change their mind. I'll do my part, but the others are up to you. I guess we probably shouldn't talk to each other until after the trial, right? We don't want people to wonder what we're up to with this bribe and all. You better go before someone starts asking questions.~ 
@17 = ~No, I better not. What if Neurik found out? He'd have me flogged! Or worse! He said it's my duty to deliver an honest verdict. Don't worry, I'm not looking to jam anyone up. I won't mention this to anyone but, if you want my vote, you'll just have to earn it in the court.~ 
@18 = ~Whew! I almost took that money, you know? I hate to think what Neurik would have done. You tell him I did the right thing, okay? Not much more I can tell you. Hope you got what you were looking for. Good luck in the trial.~ 
@19 = ~Wh- what do you want? You shouldn't be here - you'll get us both in trouble! Just... just do me a favor and leave me alone until after the trial.~
@20 = ~Don't worry, I won't go back on our deal. I'll vote to find Rolgan innocent. Just don't talk to me anymore until after the trial.~
@21 = ~I'm sure glad Rolgan's trial is over. I ain't never been on a jury before. It's almost as hard as being in the prisoner box!~
@22 = ~Too bad he ended up getting executed. Makes me sick to see his remains stuck out there on that stake in front of the Temple. But Neurik said it ain't my fault. We jurors were just doing our duty.~
@23 = ~I'm glad the Uthgardt got off. At least now I don't have to walk past his head on a spike every time I go by the Temple of Tyr. I don't know if I could have handled that.~
