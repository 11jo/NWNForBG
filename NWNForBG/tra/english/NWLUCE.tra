@0 = ~Good day, sir. My name is Luce. I trust you wish your visit to the Moonstone Mask to be a pleasant one.~ [NWLUC054]
@1 = ~NP: I will talk to you. And not just talk.~ /*I would speak with you... and perhaps more.*/
@2 = ~There's more than talking, right?~
@3 = ~Whatever, harlot. I'm not here to talk.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Well, aren't you sweet, but remember that a Pass Coin only entitles you to my time. Anything beyond that is my discretion. I'm sure we'll get along fine, though.~
@6 = ~Here is a Pass Coin. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@7 = ~NP: Here's the pass.~ /*Question*/
@8 = ~I don't have a Pass Coin.~
@9 = ~I will try to abide your gruff demeanor, but remember that a Pass Coin buys my time, not my will. If your words displease me, this encounter will end.~
@10 = ~I think you should reconsider your tone. A Pass Coin purchases my time, not my will. If I am not pleased with your behavior, this encounter will end.~
@11 = ~Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time. Just remember to provide a Pass Coin. They are available from the bartender.~
@12 = ~Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.~
@13 = ~You listen well? Does talking make your "clients" more relaxed?~
@14 = ~Let's talk about you, and what you like.~
@15 = ~Perhaps I could ask some serious questions?~
@16 = ~Perhaps we could... retire to your bedchambers, my lady?~
@17 = ~Let's knock boots, honey!~
@18 = ~I must be on my way.~
@19 = ~NP: Great, now tell me about yourself. What's on your mind? Here at The Mask, we're all very good listeners.~ /*Very well, <CHARNAME>. Now, tell me a little something about yourself. What's on your mind? We are very good listeners here at the Mask.*/
@20 = ~Well, I regret to inform you that I cannnot speak with you unless you have one. I'm sorry. See the bartender if you wish to purchase one.~
@21 = ~Important people are not often able to confide with people that care. I am a surrogate and a friend, if need be. Tell me, what bothers you?~
@22 = ~Lament the inherent loneliness of the adventurer lifestyle.~
@23 = ~Bemoan about how no one really respects you.~
@24 = ~Me strong. Nothing hurt me.~
@25 = ~I want to talk about something else.~
@26 = ~Me? Tonight I am whatever you wish. I am a confidant and a friend, if that is what you need me to be.~
@27 = ~I'd find it degrading to disguise my true self like that.~
@28 = ~That's very selfless, giving of yourself like that.~
@29 = ~Where are you from? What is your story?~
@30 = ~A prostitute with a heart of gold. Oh, that's new.~
@31 = ~NP: I'll try not to bother my coworkers unnecessarily, but I can talk to you about anything you want.~ /*How serious is "serious?" I try not to worry my companions unnecessarily, but I will endeavor to talk about whatever you like.*/
@32 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@33 = ~Shouldn't you be ashamed of working here?~
@34 = ~NP: A real gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I like you. I think I'll take you up on your offer. Follow me, dearie. Let's get out of this bright light.~ /*Such a gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing.*/
@35 = ~NP: A real gentleman. You know, I like you. I think I'll take you up on your offer. Follow me, dearie. Let's get out of this bright light.~ /*Such a gentleman. You know, <CHARNAME>, I think I quite like you. I think your suggestion is worth pursuing.*/
@36 = ~Not just yet. Patience is a virtue. Perhaps we should spend a little more time getting to know each other.~
@37 = ~I hardly think so. No, I have every right to refuse such a... distasteful advance. There is an art to this. You can't just charge like a bull.~
@38 = ~That is your option, but I must tell you that you will have to purchase another Pass Coin to speak with me again. Do you still wish to leave?~
@39 = ~I'll stay a while, I think.~
@40 = ~I must leave. Farewell.~
@41 = ~NP: No wonder you feel this way. Many important people suffer from a longing that can't be replaced by anything other than their great responsibility. You can tell me everything. I'm not going to condemn or glorify your position. I am here with you - you can put aside shyness. You're being honest with yourself, and you're following the path you've chosen because it suits you. That's the mark of a strong man.~ /*Of course you feel that way. Many people in power have a sense of yearning that just can't seem to be filled, despite their great responsibilities.*/
@42 = ~Nothing bothers me. I am strong.~
@43 = ~I am sure you are quite capable, but is your emotional armor so perfect? There is no shame in needing a kind word now and then.~
@44 = ~Of course. Our time can be spent any way that you wish. Within reason, of course. Mood is so important.~
@45 = ~Well, then it is fortunate that I am not you. I give comfort where it is needed. What do you do, besides malign the choices of others?~
@46 = ~I'm done with you. That was hurtful and inappropriate.~
@47 = ~NP: A lot of people who come here don't know what they want. I try to help them. I try to ease their worries. Some people just need a good listener. Much more than you can imagine. I hope I'm making a difference in their lives.~ /*Some people just need a sympathetic ear. More than you would think, actually. I hope I make a difference in their lives.*/
@48 = ~Well, a long time ago I was born to a loving family. And now I am here with you. Nothing is more important than that right now.~
@49 = ~NP: Look, if you want to get hit on the head, go to the dirtiest tavern on the docks - there are special rooms for that. My job is to listen and make pleasant conversation. If you don't like it, the door is right behind you. So... (ahem). What were you talking about?~ /*My job is to listen and further a positive dialogue. If you don't want that, the door is behind you. Now... (ahem)... You were saying?*/
@50 = ~NP: I will not tolerate rudeness.~ /*Me don't want troubles.*/
@51 = ~NP: You look like you are skilled with weapons, and you have other talents as well. Such versatility and a taste for battle might scare off your friends. I can fill that void, if you wish. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are too.~ /*For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes.*/
@52 = ~NP: Nothing, and if I did, I wouldn't tell you. Call it superstition, but Ofala has strictly forbidden us to speak of it. This is neither the time nor the place. Let's get back to you and what you need.~ /*Nothing, and I couldn't say if I did. Call it superstitious, but Ophala was very explicit in requesting that we don't talk of it.*/
@53 = ~Confide that you might have a big role in curing the plague.~
@54 = ~NP: Wouldn't you be better off looking after yourself? I'm not ashamed of you. Who are you to project your fears onto me? Shall we return to our pleasant conversation, or do you wish to leave?~ /*Shouldn't you reserve your judgment for your own actions? I stand before you unashamed. Who are you to project your fears on me?*/
@55 = ~NP: I'm glad. Maybe we can talk some more.~ /*Goodbye. Perhaps we'll talk another time.*/
@56 = ~Another time, then. See the bartender for additional Pass Coins.~
@57 = ~NP: You're being rather rude. Rude. Perhaps you like to play with people. That could scare your friends away from you. I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you seem a roguish type. Irreverent. Perhaps someone that enjoys playing with people. Sometimes that can keep companions at a distance.*/
@58 = ~NP: You look like someone who loves the outdoors. It's a good occupation, but doesn't it alienate your friends? I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you look very in tune with nature. A good calling, but perhaps it keeps your companions at a distance?*/
@59 = ~NP: You seem quite devout, confident in your spiritual side. If your friends don't understand you, they may distance themselves from you. I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are too.~ /*For instance, you look very devout, and sure of your spiritual side. That can sometimes keep friends at a distance if they don't understand.*/
@60 = ~NP: You look like you know a lot of secret things. Maybe that's why you're lonely. Some people find that alarming. I can fill that void if you want. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you seem very learned of arcane matters. Perhaps it sometimes keeps companions at a distance? Some people react with suspicion to such things.*/
@61 = ~NP: You look like you're skillful with a weapon. That kind of fighting might scare off your friends. I can fill that void if you'd like. That's what I'm here for, and you probably are, too.~ /*For instance, you look like someone familiar in the use of weapons. That affinity for battle can keep companions at a distance sometimes.*/
@62 = ~This talk is over. Get out before I call the guards.~
@63 = ~NP: Of course, it's a lot of stress. So many people are counting on you, sometimes without even realizing it. It's a heavy burden. I can't help you in your affairs, <CHARNAME>, but you can pour your heart out to me. I expect nothing from you.~ /*Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don't know it. That must weigh on your mind.*/
@64 = ~NP: Of course, it's a lot of stress. So many people are counting on you, sometimes without even realizing it. It's a heavy burden. I can't help you with your business, but you can pour your heart out to me. I don't expect anything from you.~ /*Well, that certainly is a lot of pressure. So many people relying on you, even if they don't know it. That must weigh on your mind.*/
@65 = ~I am sorry, m'lady, but my company is open to males alone. You might wish to see if Tanith is free.~ [NWLUC050]
@66 = ~No, I've been mistreated enough for today. I'm off. Go somewhere else.~ [NWLUC051]
@67 = ~Ah, <CHARNAME>. I trust you are well? I hope I had some impact on you. Some people have trouble recognizing when they really need someone to talk to.~ [NWLUC052]
@68 = ~I enjoyed our time together. I hope you did as well.~
@69 = ~Me like you. Hope you like me a little.~
@70 = ~You just one more for the road. Ha!~
@71 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are ever the perfect gentleman. You needn't worry. No judgments, remember?~
@72 = ~Yes, silly, I like you fine. Don't let people get you down saying you are... uh... slow. You're a charmer, you are.~
@73 = ~NP: Ah, are you all right? I hope I helped you. Some people never admit to themselves that they need someone to talk to.~ [NWLUC052] /*Ah, <CHARNAME>. I trust you are well? I hope I had some impact on you. Some people have trouble recognizing when they really need someone to talk to.*/
@74 = ~NP: You're a real gentleman. Don't worry. I'm not judging anyone, remember?~ /*<CHARNAME>, you are ever the perfect gentleman. You needn't worry. No judgments, remember?*/
