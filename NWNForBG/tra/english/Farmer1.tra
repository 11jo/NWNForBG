@12 = ~Why is gates to Luskan is closed?~
@13 = ~I have other questions.~
@14 = ~Thank you, that will be all.~
@15 = ~MT: I think they have secrets from you Neverwinterers and don't like it when someone sniffs things out. Mark my words, the Luskans can't be trusted that much.~ /*I think they're keepin' secrets from you Neverwintans and don't want anybody nosin' about. Mark my words, you can't trust a Luskan half as far as you can throw an ogre.*/

@25 = ~Any interesting characters in town?~
@26 = ~MT: Yes, there is one here, Ballard, he spends time in a grove outside the city wall, this is in the northeast of the city. He worries more about his bears than about my cows, I tell you for sure.?~ /*Aye, Ballard keeps a grove in the northeast corner of town. Has more concern for his bears than my cows, mind you.*/
@27 = ~MT: Yes, Elchelor sells goods for werewolf hunters, and Mr. Krolnober, they both spend time in the tavern. You need to go and talk to them. And then there are the Eisenfeldts, but... But I won't gossip, okay?~ /*Well, there be Alhelor the wolf-hunter's mechant and Mr. Craulnober who both spend their time at the inn. You should go and speak with them. An' then there's the Eisenfeldts but... but I'm no gossip, you hear?*/
@28 = ~MT: Who are the Eisenfeldts? Maybe I can help them...~ /*"Back again? Something I can help you with, perhaps?"*/
@29 = ~The Eisenfeldts have grown all sullen since they lost their boy, Urth, that's all. Never leave their farmhouse. I've been tillin' their lands for them when I can - I don't know what else to do...~
