@0 = ~Greetings. Blessings of the Earthmother Chauntea and the Treefather Silvanus upon you. I am Nyatar, in the service of Nature.~ [NWNYAT52]
@1 = ~Hello, I am <CHARNAME>. Could I ask some questions?~
@2 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. I have some questions.~
@3 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. Just shut up and answer my questions.~
@4 = ~Me got questions me want ask.~
@5 = ~Farewell, then.~
@6 = ~I welcome your well-mannered address. Ask what you will, and I shall respond as I am able.~
@7 = ~What is your position here?~
@8 = ~NP: Are there any nature-related places in the downtown area?~ /*Is there a place for nature in the heart of this city?*/
@9 = ~NP: I need to resupply. What can you offer?~ /*I require supplies. What can you offer?*/
@10 = ~I will assist if I can, but mind your tone in the presence of nature. I favor balance in all things, including within those people I must associate with.~
@11 = ~Walk with balance and with nature.~
@12 = ~I see to it that the city does not tip too far from balance; that concerns for natural elements are kept a priority. *Sigh* It's not easy in these times.~
@13 = ~NP: Nature is everywhere. It cannot be confined to walls or property listings. It is present even in the heart of Neverwinter. Especially at a time like this, when the population is so weakened by the plague. All harmony fails when people lose hope. I have no influence over the fate of the city. This plague is unnatural. I can't leave while such an abomination reigns here.~ /*The place of Nature is everywhere. It cannot be bound by walls or notions of property. Even in the heart of Neverwinter she must find purchase.*/
@14 = ~Why are you so sure this plague is not natural?~
@15 = ~NP: You're a <BROTHERSISTER>druid, aren't you? I can't be wrong. We are kin in the eyes of Mother Earth. You will understand. Many humans suffer from the plague, but animals suffer torment too. They languish in cages in the enclosure of the Black Lake Quarter. That's where the Neverwinter Zoo is located. It's run by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It's filthy, it's cruel, it's wrong! The animals are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@16 = ~NP: Caged animals? That's unacceptable. At least not during the plague.~ /*It can't be new. Not during the plague.*/
@17 = ~This zoo seems small next to the plague.~
@18 = ~NP: You're, uh. you're a tracker, aren't you? I can't be wrong, if there's a <BROTHERSISTER> from the forest in front of me, I'll know right away. You'll understand. Many people suffer from the plague, but animals also endure torment. They languish in cages in the enclosure of the Black Lake Quarter. That's where the Neverwinter Zoo is. It's run by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It's filthy, it's cruel, it's wrong! The animals are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@19 = ~You would not understand. Only a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in nature could fully appreciate what needs to be done. How vital my task is.~
@20 = ~I might still be able to help.~
@21 = ~NP: It kills the spirit. Victims rot from the inside out, and the life drains out of them.... But where does it go? There's a lot of energy wasted here! In nature, everything that dies is reborn elsewhere, but this Howling Death, like a thief, steals the very essence of man. It's not natural.~ /*In nature, everything that falls away is reborn elsewhere, but this Wailing steals away the very core of a person like a bandit. That is NOT natural.*/
@22 = ~NP: I did everything I could to get it shut down, but now all anyone cares about is the plague. The authorities I spoke to died of it. It just gave the zoo a reprieve. They know the law is against them, but now they'll have time to hide their dirty deeds. I'm afraid the animals will just be killed and stripped for trophies. All creatures need mercy. The bear, the panther, the wolf and the lion, they must all be saved.~ /*I fear the animals will simply be killed and made into trophies. All creatures deserve charity. This bear, panther, wolf and lion; all four should be rescued.*/
@23 = ~What do you know of this hunter?~
@24 = ~What is the purpose of the zoo?~
@25 = ~I will help you free these animals.~
@26 = ~I have no interest in helping.~
@27 = ~I will help.~
@28 = ~I have no interest in this.~
@29 = ~NP: You think like everyone else. I did everything I could to get it shut down, but now all anyone cares about is the plague. The authorities I spoke to died of it. It only gave the zoo a reprieve. They know the law is against them, but now they'll have time to hide their dirty deeds. I'm afraid the animals will just be killed and stripped for trophies. All creatures need mercy. The bear, the panther, the wolf and the lion, they must all be saved.~ /*Your attitude is the majority. I was working to have it closed, but the plague has delayed that indefinitely. The officials I spoke with are among the plague dead.*/
@30 = ~NP: Perhaps I'm judging too quickly. You have an honest face. Maybe you can understand why this is so important. Many people suffer from the plague, but animals suffer too. They languish in cages in a pen in the Black Lake Quarter. That's where the Neverwinter Zoo is located. It's run by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It's filthy, it's cruel, it's wrong! The animals are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@31 = ~No, while I appreciate your offer, this would best be left to someone more inclined to understand balance.~
@32 = ~NP: Are there places in the downtown area that are connected to nature?~ /*Is there a place for nature in the heart of this city?*/
@33 = ~NP: Montgomery "Precision Shot" Weatherson. His family has always been animal rights advocates, but Montgomery changed his views when his father died. He defines his success by what he has managed to take hold of: family, business, and nature, one creature at a time. He lives out of harmony. Several aristocrats depend on him. Their influence has protected him from what little pressure I have been able to exert on him through the law.~ /*Several nobles live vicariously through him. Their influence protects him from what little pressure I have been able to apply thorugh the law.*/
@34 = ~NP: They claim they want to show the common people the beauty of nature, but in reality, only members of a few rich families are allowed in. There are humane ways to do these things, but the zoo just keeps the animals captive, showing the superiority of the human race. The animals in the zoo are cared for in such a way that they would rather pin their heads on the wall!~ /*They claim they want common people to see the beauty of nature but, in truth, only the families of certain nobles are allowed in.*/
@35 = ~NP: That's what I was hoping you'd say. Take a few things, you'll need them. I've been thinking a lot about what I might need. This key will get you into the zoo. My pet assistant found it and I made copies. You can be stopped by guards, but not the doors. This is the "crossing over plants" scroll. Use it on the big tree by the zoo, and all the animals you bring there will end up here.~ /*This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.*/
@36 = ~Please, speak with these animals as I know you can. Lead them to freedom at the large tree before their lives are lost. There is no purpose to their captivity.~

@38 = ~And take this Scented Fetish. It will let you speak to the animals with the skill of a druid or a ranger. Please, lead the animals to the large tree and freedom.~

@40 = ~NP: I understand your reluctance, it's such a difficult time, but little things matter too. Please take this in case you change your mind. This key will get you into the zoo. My animal assistant "found" it, and I made copies. You can be stopped by guards, but not by the door. This is a scroll for "crossing through plants". Use it on the big tree by the zoo, and all the animals you bring there will end up here.~ /*I understand your reluctance in this troublesome time, but these little things make a diffence too. Please, take this in case you change your mind.*/
@41 = ~NP: Glad to hear it. I remember I gave you the key to the zoo and a scroll to cross the plants. Use the scroll on the big tree by the zoo, and all the animals you bring there will be there.~ /*This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.*/
@42 = ~NP: Please think about it again. The animals must not die.~ /*Please step back; the patients need their sleep.*/
@43 = ~Greetings again, . Nature welcomes you. I hope the day has held you in better health than those poor creatures in the Blacklake zoo.~ [NWNYAT53]
@44 = ~What animals? Is there something you need help with?~
@45 = ~There has been progress in freeing the animals.~
@46 = ~Go over what is needed again.~
@47 = ~NP: Many people suffer from the plague, but animals suffer torment too. They languish in cages in the enclosure of the Black Lake neighborhood. That's where the Neverwinter Zoo is. It's run by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It's filthy, it's cruel, it's wrong! The animals are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@48 = ~NP: I remember I gave you the key to the zoo and a scroll to cross the plants. Use the scroll on the big tree by the zoo, and all the animals you bring there will be there.~ /*This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.*/
@49 = ~That is good to know. Truth be told, my animal spies have kept me informed. I have felt it necessary to carefully monitor the creatures involved.~
@50 = ~All the animals were indeed freed, but the deaths suffered among those creatures has given this task a horrible end.~
@51 = ~NP: All the animals are free and safe. Too bad their keepers are dead. Everyone has a chance at life. Maybe they just missed their chance. You can say it was a success, and I'll reward you accordingly. I'm sure you'll be pleased. Please accept this award with the blessing of Mother Earth, Father Tree and mine as well.~ /*All the animals are free and safe. A pity about the deaths among their captors. All life deserves a chance... but perhaps that was their chance.*/

@53 = ~There has been some movement, but not all of the animals are safe. Please, if there is something you can do to help, this is the time.~
@54 = ~NP: They're all dead. You can't call that a successful conclusion, can you? I can't. And here I was hoping for a little ray of light in the midst of this plague. Please leave me alone. I don't want to talk. It's a tragedy.~ /*They are all dead. You can't call this a success, can you? I can't. I was hoping for a bright spot amidst the plague...*/

@56 = ~NP: Well, at least some of the animals are saved. That's something. Some life in the midst of this time of death. I'm not entirely satisfied, but it could have been worse. I want to reward you for what you've done, but, you see, the reward can't be too generous. The result could have been much better. Take this award and say thank you. Our cooperation has not been particularly successful.~ /*I want to grant you a reward for what was done, but you'll understand that I can't be too generous. This matter was not handled as well as it could have.*/

@58 = ~NP: Only one animal killed. Well, that's almost a victory. Compared to everything else, a victory for life at last. Here, take this with my blessing. I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Your service was on the level.~ /*At least only one of the animals was killed. That can be called a victory of sorts. Amidst everything else, there is a victory for life here.*/
@59 = ~Greetings again, . Nature welcomes you. I hope the day has held you in better health than those poor creatures in the Blacklake zoo.~ [NWNYAT53]
@60 = ~NP: The plague is still rampant, but there is good news. The animals are no longer languishing in that horrible zoo. Thank you for your help, it's invaluable!~ [NWNYAT51] /*The plague still rages, but some small comfort has been given. Animals are no longer caged in that horrible zoo.*/
@61 = ~NP: The plague is no longer rampant and the animals are no longer languishing in that horrible zoo. Thank you for your help, it is invaluable!~ /*The plague still rages, but some small comfort has been given. Animals are no longer caged in that horrible zoo.*/
@62 = ~NP: Everything dies. People. Animals. One man can't do anything. Or can he? Please leave me alone. I don't want to talk to anyone.~ [NWNYAT50] /*Everything is dying. people... the animals... There's not much a person can do... is there?*/
