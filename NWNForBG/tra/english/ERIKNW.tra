@0 = ~Hey, who do you think you are barging into a man's room like that! The door was locked for a reason...~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~I'd like to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~I'm Erik, Ingo's son. Now, that's as polite as I'm going to be until you tell me why you broke into my room?~
@5 = ~Your father told me you could use some cheering up.~
@6 = ~I was just exploring.~
@7 = ~NP: It will be better for you if you don't ask this question again.~ /*Probably safer for you if you don't ask that question again.*/
@8 = ~I suppose I have the time for a few questions. Try to make it quick, though.~
@9 = ~I want to talk about that brooch again.~
@10 = ~What do you know of the cultists who beset Neverwinter?~
@11 = ~I'm looking for work, if you know of any.~
@12 = ~I need some directions.~
@13 = ~Return to me with the brooch and you shall have your reward.~
@14 = ~NP: You should have guessed that your father sent you. He always worries too much about me. Whatever brings you here, you can turn around and leave. Unless you have something important to do.~ /*Whatever your reason for being here, you can turn around and leave, unless you have something important you want.*/
@15 = ~An adventurer are ya? Well go explore somewhere else will ya?~
@16 = ~NP: Threats? Great, that's exactly what I was missing. You must be one of those adventurers. Get out of my house!~ /*Threats? Great, just what I need. You must be one of those adventurer types.*/
@17 = ~So do I, so do I. But go ahead, ask what you will. I'll do my best to answer.~
@18 = ~I have the brooch.~
@19 = ~What's so important about this brooch again?~
@20 = ~Tell me again where I can find her.~
@21 = ~Tell me about Constance again.~
@22 = ~Is there anything else about her you're not telling me?~
@23 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@24 = ~NP: Almost no news reaches us. About a week ago I saw some suspicious guy walking along the road to Charwood. Maybe he's one of them. Do you need anything else?~ /*We don't hear much out here. I saw a suspicious-looking fellow take the road to Charwood a week back or so, though. Maybe he was one.*/
@25 = ~Hmph. I could sure use a favor right now and maybe you're a <PRO_MANWOMAN> who can help. Interested in the details?~
@26 = ~I don't do favors; I do jobs. You want to pay me for this, then you should tell me about it.~
@27 = ~Tell me about this favor.~
@28 = ~I know much of the area around here, so I suppose I could help out. Where exactly do you need directions to?~
@29 = ~NP: Where does the northern road lead?~ /*Where does the west road lead?*/
@30 = ~Where does the east road lead?~
@31 = ~Where can I go to buy supplies?~
@32 = ~NP: Where can I stay overnight?~ /*Where can I find Shade?*/
@33 = ~It's been good talking to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@34 = ~NP: It's all Pa has left for Mom... Of all the things I could show Constance! *Sighs* Should have been limited to wildflowers... Is there anything else you want to ask before you get the brooch?~ /*It's all me pa has left to remind him of my ma... Of all the things to show Constance! *Sigh* I ought to have stuck with wildflowers...*/
@35 = ~NP: She's with O'Deal's daughter, who keeps cows on a nearby farm... Remember, don't hurt her. I just want my brooch back.~ /*She's farmer O'Deel's daughter, the one who keeps cattle up by the waterfalls... Remember, don't hurt her. I just need that brooch back.*/
@36 = ~NP: Her hair is the color of ripe wheat, her laugh is like the murmur of a stream ... And her eyes are blue as the sky! Is there anything else you want to ask before you get the brooch?~ /*Her hair's the color of cornsilk, her laugh's like the waterfall, her eyes are as blue as the sky... Her heart, though, it's sprung like a bear trap!*/
@37 = ~Well, I don't know that it matters but her pa's been having trouble with wolves, lately. Maybe you can get on his good side if you take care of that.~
@38 = ~NP: What would you like to know?~ /*What do you wish to know?*/
@39 = ~The west road? That takes you by the tower of that wizard fellow, Wanev, and eventually on to Port Llast.~
@40 = ~Into the woods, that one. Pa says it's haunted and he'd know. Apparently there used to be a village named Charwood in there but I've never seen it...~
@41 = ~NP: There is almost nothing as far as Port Llast, I'm afraid. We only go there during the harvest. Me and Pa and the O'Deals are here on their own. The O'Deals live east of our farm.~ /*Ain't much between here and Port Llast, I'm afraid. We only go in at harvest season. Me, pa, and the O'Deel's are pretty much on our own. The O'deels live just down the road.*/
@42 = ~NP: There are no hotels here, I think my father will not mind if you spend the night in our house.~ /*Hah! I suppose none of the lads would mind if I chatted for a moment.*/
@43 = ~What? Oh, sure, I suppose I could do that. I'll pay ya, if you can do it.~
@44 = ~NP: Maybe Pa told you that I've been kind of a little out of my mind lately. Well, he doesn't even know half of it. My heart is broken, but ... All this ulcer, Constance O'Deal - knows that I would give my life for her little finger, and teases me. Oh, what a fool I am... She wanted to look at her mother's brooch, so I brought it. And now this witch doesn't want to give it back!~ /*My pa might have told that I've been feeling a little down, lately. Well he doesn't even know the half of it. Sure, I'm a little heartbroken but...*/
@45 = ~Forget my stupid heart, if I don't get that brooch back, pa will have my hide instead!~
@46 = ~What's so important about the brooch?~
@47 = ~Can't you just buy the brooch from her?~
@48 = ~Tell me about Constance.~
@49 = ~Okay, I'll do it.~
@50 = ~I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@51 = ~NP: It's all Pa has left for Mom... Of all the things I could show Constance! *sighs* Should've been limited to wildflowers... So you think you can get the brooch? I will reward anyone who brings it to me, I promise.~ /*It's all me pa has left to remind him of my ma... Of all the things to show Constance! *Sigh* I ought to have stuck with wildflowers...*/
@52 = ~What would your ma think about this?~
@53 = ~NP: You don't know Constance. Who even knows her! She doesn't need money at all. She just wants me to beg her. Well, I won't! In the end, she must understand that the human heart is not a toy... Please! I will reward you generously, I promise.~ /*You don't know Constance. I don't know if anyone does. It's not money she's after. She just wants to see me beg. Well I won't do it!*/
@54 = ~How do you know she doesn't want money?~
@55 = ~NP: Her hair is the color of ripe wheat, her laugh is like a murmur of a stream, her eyes are blue as the sky ... And her heart grabs you like a bear trap! And thanks to me, the fool, she now has her mother's brooch!!! I will generously reward anyone who returns it to me, I swear.~ /*Her hair's the color of cornsilk, her laugh's like the waterfall, her eyes are as blue as the sky... Her heart, though, it's sprung like a bear trap!*/
@56 = ~NP: Is it true? She's the daughter of O'Deal, who keeps cows on a nearby farm... Do whatever you want to get your mother's brooch back, just don't touch it... *sighs* Just look at me, I'm still worried about her, even now...~ /*Do whatever it takes to get me ma's brooch back, short of laying a finger on her... *Sigh* Look at me, I still worry for her, even now...*/
@57 = ~If she were still alive, she probably would have given the brooch to Constance long ago. But ma's not still alive, see? That's the problem...~
@58 = ~I feel like I don't know anything anymore. Go ahead, try to buy it from her, maybe it will work. *Sigh* Women are way too complicated...~
@59 = ~Hmm... an interesting situation. I've never had a woman break into my room before.~
@60 = ~Back so soon, are you lock-breaker? I hope you're not here just to mock me and pull on heartstrings.~
@61 = ~You mentioned something about a job before.~
@62 = ~Ah, the charming lock-breaker. To what do I owe the pleasure of a return visit?~
@63 = ~How goes the search? Have you recovered the brooch, or is there something else I can do for you?~
@64 = ~NP: How did you manage to convince her!? No, don't answer... Perhaps it's better for me not to know. So, now to the question of rewards...~ /*How did you ever manage to convince her!? Actually, nevermind... I probably don't want to know.*/
@65 = ~You've been a good friend to a poor soul down on his luck. Here you go, 650 gold pieces in exchange for the brooch.~
@66 = ~That's a lot of money. Are you sure you can afford it?~
@67 = ~You'd better cough up more or you won't live long enough to regret it!~
@68 = ~Thanks. It was a joy to help.~
@69 = ~It's money I've made off my own plot of land. I was saving it to marry Constance someday but that would be a foolish venture, I'm afraid.~
@70 = ~But now I must take my leave. Me pa was getting worried I'd never run those errands for him...~
@71 = ~NP: Calm down, don't be so nervous. Let's not be rude. Here, I have another 100 gold, that's all my money. Take it And now I have to go. Dad will start to worry if I finally do not fulfill his orders ....~ /*N-now just settle down, there's no need to get upset. No need for unpleasantness. Here, I've got another 100 gold, but that's it. Just take it, it's yours.*/
@72 = ~You've been a good friend to a poor soul down on his luck. Here you go, 650 gold pieces in exchange for the brooch.~
@73 = ~You've been a good friend to a poor soul down on his luck. Here you go, 650 gold pieces in exchange for the brooch.~
@74 = ~*Sigh* Women... And that's all I have to say on the matter...~
