@0 = ~Eh? What can Tomi do for ya?~ [NWTOM050]
@1 = ~I just want to talk.~
@2 = ~Nothing, I'm all right.~
@3 = ~NP: О? What's on your mind, <LADYLORD>?~ /*Oh? What did you have in mind, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?*/
@4 = ~I'd like to know a little more about you.~
@5 = ~I want you to continue your story from before.~
@6 = ~Tell me more about your story.~
@7 = ~Do you have any advice or suggestions you can give me about my mission?~
@8 = ~Fair enough. Back to the adventure!~
@9 = ~NP: О? It's rather odd that you would ask that, <LADYLORD>. Most people think that because they know Tomi Hangman's reputation, they know Tomi himself. In Calimport, tales of my exploits were the daily bread for the old men in the taverns. I don't mean heroic deeds, however... I'm a halfling from the underworld, if you remember.~ /*In Calimport, the tales of my deeds were the daily fodder of old men in the taverns. I do not speak of heroic acts, however... I am a halfling of the underworld, if you remember.*/
@10 = ~What sorts of deeds are you talking about, then?~
@11 = ~I'm not much for heroism, myself.~
@12 = ~I don't think I want to hear more about it, then.~
@13 = ~Oh, nothing so sordid and evil as you might guess. I've had fame and fortune a'plenty more than once... and lost it all just as often.~
@14 = ~NP: Then you're <MALEFEMALE> my kind of guy. While there are plenty of reasons to get your butt off the couch in the world, the best ones are always gold and fame. I've done a lot of chasing those two myself. Had both in vast quantities and lost both more than once, you know.~ /*Then you're a <PRO_MANWOMAN> after my own heart. While there's often good reasons to do anything, the best are always gold and fame.*/
@15 = ~NP: Ha ha! Don't get me wrong, <LADYLORD>... I may not be a hero type, but it's not like I'm stealing children and kicking puppies all the way. No, no, Tomi the Hangman may follow the trail of gold and glory wherever it leads, but so far my stories aren't the kind of low-grade tales that make the ears of the righteous burn with shame.~ /*No, no, Tomi Undergallows may follow the scent of gold and fame wherever it leads, but I've no dastardly tales to singe the ears off the pious just yet.*/
@16 = ~NP: My most famous accomplishment, in fact, is one of the reasons I chose Neverwinter when I pulled out of Kalimshan. You see, for most of my life in Calimport, I served under a powerful jellyfish. She wielded a great deal of power in the city's underworld, and that's not easy for anyone, whether you turn someone to stone with a look or not.~ /*You see, I'd spent the larger part of my years in Calimport in the employ of a powerful medusa. She was a great power in the city's underworld and that is no small feat for anyone, statue-making gaze or no.*/
@17 = ~A medusa? Are you serious?~
@18 = ~But a medusa is an evil monster!~
@19 = ~NP: Very serious. She had business acumen, and even a cold-blooded killer could be brutal. But you couldn't send her to negotiate face-to-face, if you know what I mean. I was her employee for, uh. errands. Robberies, delivering messages, walking the cat, murders, that sort of thing. I was good at my job, that's what I was known for.~ /*Quite serious. She had a fine head for business and was as ruthless as any cold-hearted shiyk. Not as good with the face-to-face negotiations, though, if you take my meaning.*/
@20 = ~NP: That's right. She was a piece of shit, believe me. She had the business acumen, the head, and the hair to bite. I was her employee for, uh. errands. Robberies, delivering messages, walking the cat, murders, that sort of thing. I was good at my job, that's what I was known for.~ /*I was in her employ to run... errands. Burglaries, message deliveries, walking her cat, assassinations, that sort of thing. I did my job well, too, and was well-known for it.*/
@21 = ~The job that made me famous, however, was the last one she gave me. I was to infiltrate the house of the famous vizier Sabbalan Viheyed... and kill him!~
@22 = ~You were an assassin? That's horrible!~
@23 = ~Were you successful?~
@24 = ~I don't want to hear anymore about this.~
@25 = ~NP: If it's any consolation to you, <LADYLORD>, I doubt I've ever killed anyone who didn't deserve it. You're surviving as best you can in Calimport. We have a case to take care of, I think. Perhaps I'd better tell you the rest some other time. What do you say to that, <LADYLORD>?~ /*If it's any consolation, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>, I doubt I killed anyone who didn't deserve it. In Calimport, you do what you can to survive.*/
@26 = ~I'd like to hear the rest now.~
@27 = ~Fine, let's go.~
@28 = ~I doubt I'll want to hear the rest of that.~
@29 = ~NP: It did, although not in the way you probably think. This story hasn't even started yet. I think we have some business to take care of. Perhaps I'd better tell you the rest some other time. What do you say to that, <LADYLORD>?~ /*We've business to undertake, I suppose. Perhaps I'd best tell the rest of the story another time. What do you say to that, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?*/
@30 = ~Wow, you're more impatient than a drunk cameldriver in line at the salt market, aren't you? Ask me another time and I'll tell ya everything.~
@31 = ~NP: That's fine. Lead the way, <LADYLORD>!~ /*Hokey-dokey. Lead on, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>!*/
@32 = ~Well, as I recall, you are the one who asked... so that's entirely up to you. Lead on!~
@33 = ~NP: What are you talking about? Oh, yeah. So where was I? Did I tell you about my infiltration of the grand vizier Sabbalan Vihayed's house? Yes, I believe you did. It was no easy task, my friend. Sabbalan had stood in the way of my snake-haired mistress for years. he was a wizard of considerable power.~ /*What's this? Oh, right. Where was I? Was I telling you about my infiltration of the house of the great vizier Sabbalan Viheyed? Yes, I believe I was.*/
@34 = ~Sending me to kill him was both a vote of confidence in my abilities and, I thought, a near-certain sentence of death. Looking me in the eyes would have been cleaner.~
@35 = ~Were you able to infiltrate his house?~
@36 = ~Why agree to the task, then?~
@37 = ~So there was considerable danger involved?~
@38 = ~NP: I told you this job made me famous, didn't I? And anyway. the threat of turning into a very small garden gnome was an extra incentive to win. Perhaps it's for the best that we halflings aren't really noticed. I managed to sneak into the vizier's house as a cook, and I didn't arouse anyone's suspicion.~ /*Perhaps it's fortunate that us halflings aren't given much credit. I was able to squirm my way into the vizier's service as a kitchen boy, and nobody gave me a second thought.*/
@39 = ~NP: Not that I have a choice. With a mistress like that, you either succeed in your task or join the amusing figures in her garden. Perhaps it's for the best that we halflings aren't really noticed. I managed to sneak into the vizier's house as a cook, and I didn't arouse anyone's suspicion.~ /*Perhaps it's fortunate that us halflings aren't given much credit. I was able to squirm my way into the vizier's service as a kitchen boy, and nobody gave me a second thought.*/
@40 = ~NP: Oh, yeah, of course. Honestly, that's what I lived for back then. They called me Tomi the Brave! The possibility of adding to my statue collection in case of failure added a certain poignancy to my position. Perhaps it was for the best that we halflings weren't really noticed. I had managed to sneak into the vizier's house as a cook without arousing anyone's suspicion.~ /*Oh, yes, of course. To be honest it was what I lived for at the time. Tomi the Daring, they called me! The possibility of being turned into a statue if I failed did put things into perspective, to boot.*/
@41 = ~For over a month, I was pleased to serve the vizier his meals. I spent my time studying him, looking for a way to kill him cleanly... and he barely even noticed my presence.~
@42 = ~Why didn't you just poison his food?~
@43 = ~If he didn't notice you, wouldn't that make it easy?~
@44 = ~Didn't you feel bad about it at all?~
@45 = ~NP: Well, you could, I guess. if he wasn't sharing a meal with his daughter, which complicates matters. His daughter. ah, sweet girl. Sayida was her name. Human, naturally, but never looked down on me. I suppose I put off killing Sabbalan for a while just to be near her, though I didn't think much of it at the time. Just found one excuse after another.~ /*I suppose I delayed killing Sabbalan at the time just to continue being around her, though I didn't think that at the time. There was just one more excuse after another.*/
@46 = ~NP: I would have poisoned it if it were a normal occasion. However, the Vizier was eating with his daughter and, uh. she noticed me. His daughter. ah, sweet girl. Her name was Sayyida. Human, naturally, but never looked down on me. I suppose I put off killing Sabbalan for a while just to be near her, though I didn't think much of it at the time. Just found one excuse after another.~ /*I suppose I delayed killing Sabbalan at the time just to continue being around her, though I didn't think that at the time. There was just one more excuse after another.*/
@47 = ~NP: About the Vizier? Not really. He was a cruel man with political ambitions. His daughter, on the other hand. well, that's another story. His daughter. ah, sweet girl. Sayida was her name. Human, naturally, but she never looked down on me. I suppose I put off killing Sabbalan for a while just to be near her, though I didn't think much of it at the time. Just found one excuse after another.~ /*I suppose I delayed killing Sabbalan at the time just to continue being around her, though I didn't think that at the time. There was just one more excuse after another.*/
@48 = ~The months grew longer, and Saida and I grew closer. She couldn't resist my charms, of course, heh... no lass can, when I put my mind to it. We had to be secret about it... I was, of course, just the kitchen boy.~
@49 = ~Were you in love with her?~
@50 = ~But it had to be an impossible situation.~
@51 = ~You had to kill her father eventually, didn't you?~
@52 = ~NP: Oh, I don't know now. But I thought so at the time, that's for sure. My mistress, however, kept threatening to turn me into a statue, with all the comforts of pigeons. But I was young, stupid, and foolish. three traits that are great in a blooming maiden but terrible in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my mistress she could go look in the mirror. Needless to say, she didn't like it.~ /*I was young and foolish and stupid, however... three traits that are great in a buxom lass but poor in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my patroness to go look in the mirror.*/
@53 = ~You betrayed her. I wouldn't take it well, either.~
@54 = ~Why didn't you just kill the mage and run off with the girl?~
@55 = ~What did she do about it?~
@56 = ~NP: Oh, yeah. I couldn't let Sayida know who I was. but my mistress was losing her patience. A little more and I would have been a monument to Tomi, with all the comforts of pigeons. But I was young, dumb and stupid.... three traits that are great in a blooming maiden but terrible in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my mistress she could go look in the mirror. Needless to say, she didn't like it.~ /*I was young and foolish and stupid, however... three traits that are great in a buxom lass but poor in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my patroness to go look in the mirror.*/
@57 = ~NP: Oh, yeah, I was afraid to even think about it, but my mistress had already threatened to turn me into a statue, with all the comforts of pigeons. But I was young, dumb, and stupid. three traits that are great in a blooming maiden but terrible in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my mistress she could go look in the mirror. Needless to say, she didn't like it.~ /*I was young and foolish and stupid, however... three traits that are great in a buxom lass but poor in an assassin. I decided I couldn't hurt Saida by killing her father and told my patroness to go look in the mirror.*/
@58 = ~NP: Well, fortunately, at least you don't turn your best friends into sculptures. My mistress, you know, wasn't exactly a socialite. My snake-haired mistress decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh. if I'd known, I'd have left Calimport a little early.~ /*Well, fortunately you don't turn your closest friends into pottery. My patroness wasn't exactly the life of the party, you know.*/
@59 = ~I still don't see how this all made you famous.~
@60 = ~Well, don't even think about betraying me, got it?~
@61 = ~NP: The girl wasn't going anywhere..... believe me, I've tried. And come to think of it, you can't kill a wizard that easily either.... My snake-haired mistress decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh. if I'd known, I would have left Calimport a little earlier.~ /*My medusa patroness decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh... if I'd known, I would have left Calimport a lot earlier.*/
@62 = ~NP: Well, a jellyfish is an evil woman with snakes instead of hair and a murderous stare..... what do you think she did? My snake-haired mistress decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh. if I'd have known, I would have left Calimport a little earlier.~ /*My medusa patroness decided to take matters into her own hands, of course. Heh... if I'd known, I would have left Calimport a lot earlier.*/
@63 = ~NP: At the time, of course, no one could have guessed that, believe me, <LADYLORD>. Anyway. that's only part of the story. I'll tell the rest some other time. For now, let's get back to your assignment.~ /*At any rate... it's a bit of a story. I'll tell you the rest some other time. Let's just keep on with your quest, for now.*/
@64 = ~NP: Hey, hey, hey! Not so fast, <LADYLORD>! Don't run ahead of the horse and all that, shh, shh. Anyway... that's only part of the story. I'll tell the rest some other time. For now, let's get back to your assignment.~ /*At any rate... it's a bit of a story. I'll tell you the rest some other time. Let's just keep on with your quest, for now.*/
@65 = ~NP: All right, all right. Now imagine, <LADYLORD>: here I am lying in the arms of my lovely little girl, and I have no idea that my angry mistress is on her way. Nor did I know that at the same time the father of my beauty, the Vizier, had at last turned his attention to me, not without the help of an old rival of mine.~ /*Oh, fine, fine. Picture this, then, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>: there I was lying in the arms of my human sweetie, completely unaware my angry patroness was on her way.*/
@66 = ~Both the wizard and the medusa were descending on the tower determined to kill me, and I was contentedly asleep in the hay, naked as a jaybird.~
@67 = ~Well, that can't have been good.~
@68 = ~I think I see where this is going...~
@69 = ~I don't believe a word of it.~
@70 = ~NP: Yeah, sleeping naked in the hay could very well end up taking the straw right out of the..... uh, you mean, like, murderous plans and stuff. No, no, there wasn't much good in it. So, I'm lying there with a big smile on my face, yeah? Suddenly, bang! The attic door flew off its hinges and the Grand Vizier stood on the doorstep, full of rage!~ /*Yes, well, being naked in the hay can leave you picking straw out of your... oh, you probably mean the coming-to-kill me thing. No, no, that wasn't good.*/
@71 = ~So he caught you with his daughter? Did you defend her honor?~
@72 = ~You fought him then, I take it?~
@73 = ~NP: That's what you think, but you're wrong. All I knew at that point was that sleeping in the hay wasn't as comfortable as it's supposed to be, even with a girl nestled on my shoulder. So I'm lying there with a big smile on my face, huh? And suddenly - BANG! The attic door flew off its hinges, and on the threshold stood the Grand Vizier, full of rage!~ /*You'd think so, but you'd be wrong. All I knew at the time was that sleeping in hay isn't as comfortable as you'd think, even with a gal on your arm.*/
@74 = ~NP: Ha ha! Wait, <LADYLORD>... it's gonna get worse. So, I'm lying there with a big smile on my face, huh? And suddenly - BANG! The attic door blows off its hinges, and on the doorstep stands the Grand Vizier, full of rage!~ /*So I am lying there with my big smile, aye? Suddenly, BAM! The door to the loft flies open, and there is the great vizier full of rage!*/
@75 = ~NP: Oh, no. I'd already taken her innocence, and I didn't care about honor from a high tower, <LADYLORD>. No, no, I hid behind her back and screamed in banshee-like terror. Not a very heroic picture, I admit. I skipped between his legs and ran naked through the streets. Before I knew it, the vizier was chasing me through half the city, hurling lightning bolts and curses at me as I ran.~ /*Oh, no. I'd already taken her virtue, and I wasn't aware of any honor, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. No, no, I hid behind her and screamed in terror like a banshee. Not the most heroic picture, I'll admit.*/
@76 = ~NP: Fight him? With what, my charming smile? I took cover behind his daughter's back and screamed like a banshee. Not the most heroic picture, I admit. I skipped between his legs and ran naked through the streets. Before I knew it, the vizier was chasing me through half the city, hurling lightning bolts and curses at me as I ran.~ /*I darted through his legs and fled naked into the streets. Before I knew it, the vizier was chasing me through half the city, firing off lightning bolts and curses at a rapid pace.*/
@77 = ~NP: My hostess was also somewhat angry at our inattention as we whizzed past her, and joined the race. Her fury grew as we overtook her. I raced as hard as I could, but cut me if that old prick didn't know how to move his skinny knees! Eventually the jellyfish found him furiously strangling me on top of the tallest building in Sabaan Market.~ /*I ran for all I was worth, but bugger me if that wizard couldn't move those skinny little legs of his! The medusa finally found him throttling me angrily atop the largest building in the Market Sabaan.*/
@78 = ~What happened then?~
@79 = ~Go on.~
@80 = ~NP: Well, my mistress was so furious that she was not going to give up the right to kill me first. She and the vizier pulled me from each other like a tug-of-war, and all I could do was gurgle helplessly! They threatened and shouted at each other, and at last the jellyfish lifted her veil! The Vizier saw this and lunged at her, casting a deadly spell in a leap!~ /*Well, my patroness was mad enough that she was determined to be the one to murder me first. She and vizier yanked me between them like some tug-of-war, and all I could do was gurgle helplessly!*/
@81 = ~NP: He hit right into her and they both flew off the edge of the roof! I would have been only too glad to be rid of them, but alas, poor Tomi they brought them with them! We hit three canopies on the way down and finally landed right in the middle of the marketplace! The vizier's spell had worked, and the jellyfish was dead..... but not before turning him into a statue. A broken statue, by then. And among them sat me, naked, stunned, but otherwise whole.~ /*We hit three canopies on the way down and finally landed square in the middle of the market! The vizier's spell had worked, as the medusa was dead... but not before he had been turned into a statue. A broken statue, by that time. And there I sat, naked and stunned but otherwise unhurt.*/
@82 = ~And this made you famous?~
@83 = ~You're making all that up!~
@84 = ~NP: Of course you did. The crowd thought I'd killed a mighty jellyfish and a glorious wizard. with my bare hands, no less. I was in no condition to argue. The rumor spread quickly, of course. with various additions. You wouldn't believe the versions I heard. Unfortunately, the guards believed them. I was hunted down as the Vizier's assassin. It may have been good for my reputation, but it was bad for my health. And it made too much of an impression on his daughter.~ /*I was a wanted man for murdering the vizier. Good for my reputation, perhaps, but bad for my health. His daughter wasn't too impressed, either.*/
@85 = ~She was angry at you for killing her father?~
@86 = ~For good reason, no doubt!~
@87 = ~NP: Hmm. I wish I had! The whole crowd thought I had killed a mighty jellyfish and a wizard with my bare hands... and I was in no condition to object. The rumor, of course, quickly spread... with various additions. You wouldn't believe the versions I heard. Unfortunately, the guards believed them. I was hunted down as the Vizier's assassin. It may have been good for my reputation, but it was bad for my health. And it made too much of an impression on his daughter.~ /*I was a wanted man for murdering the vizier. Good for my reputation, perhaps, but bad for my health. His daughter wasn't too impressed, either.*/
@88 = ~NP: You'd think, but no... she just didn't want to live with a half-breed wanted by the guards. I had to prove my innocence! That's why I decided to go to Neverwinter. One of my oldest friends lives there, a master forger. I was hoping he could forge some documents to exonerate me in Calimport.~ /*That's why I decided to come to Neverwinter. One of my oldest friends lives here and is a forgery master! I was hoping he'd make some documents to clear my name in Calimport.*/
@89 = ~NP: Well, she wasn't as broken up about her father as I thought she was. she just didn't want to marry a half-breed wanted by the police. I needed to prove my innocence! That's why I decided to go to Neverwinter. One of my oldest friends lives there, a master forger! I was hoping he could forge some documents to clear my name in Calimport.~ /*That's why I decided to come to Neverwinter. One of my oldest friends lives here and is a forgery master! I was hoping he'd make some documents to clear my name in Calimport.*/
@90 = ~Sadly, I suspect Belman's fallen victim to the plague. Can't find him anywhere. So... that means no evidence and no marriage for poor li'l Tomi.~
@91 = ~Perhaps we'll find your friend, yet.~
@92 = ~Well, give it up, then. Your friend is dead, I'm sure.~
@93 = ~Oh, who cares about him? I just want those documents. Maybe he finished them before he croaked. *Sigh* I can only hope.~
@94 = ~Are these the documents you're talking about?~
@95 = ~If I find them, I'll let you know.~
@96 = ~As long as you don't let your search interfere with your service to me!~
@97 = ~Oh, I bet he is. Belman was never very lucky. I just hope he finished those documents before he croaked.~
@98 = ~NP: Wha-what? You're kidding, right? Let me see that! Uh, uh. Hayden, Lord Freedling. "Halfling. Yeah, that's my old nickname. And it's definitely Belman's work, finally. But it's just my luck that it's the shittiest of his work! Calimport would laugh if I tried to show them! Oh, come on, that's life. And anyway, Sayida had these teeth. I don't know what I was thinking. I guess I should thank you for saving me the trouble, <LADYLORD>.~ /*Ah, well, that's life. Saida had the biggest buck teeth, anyway... don't know what I was thinking. I suppose I should thank you for saving me the effort, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>.*/
@99 = ~That'd be nice of ya, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Until then, let's just go about your quest, aye?~
@100 = ~Fat chance of that, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Let's get back to your quest, then, shall we?~
@101 = ~Hmmm... come to think of it, here. Let me give ya this in return. It was a ring that the vizier wore that I, um, managed to slip off his finger before he got stoned.~
@102 = ~Thank you, Tomi.~
@103 = ~That's it? A simple ring?~
@104 = ~NP: Uh, well. the Vizier kind of treasured it. Said it had some kind of great magic in it, but I didn't notice. Maybe it'll bring you luck. Either way, at least I don't have to run around looking for that stupid Belman anymore. I'd still kill him for his stupidity. Let's just get back to your mission, shall we?~ /*Yeah, well... the vizier seemed to value it. Said it had great magic in it, but it never did nothing for me. Maybe it'll bring you luck.*/
@105 = ~Oh, there's not much story left to tell, is there, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>? I'm just hoping we'll come across Belman's documents someday.~
@106 = ~Naaahhh, I'm not in the mood to talk more about that. Let's just keep going with your quest, aye?~
@107 = ~NP: I thought you didn't care about any of this stuff? Let's get on with your assignment. I'll take care of my own problems.~ /*They're dead, actually. Baram and his rats ate them.*/
@108 = ~Hmm. I guess I can tell you a bit about the Peninsula district, if you want... but I'm not very familiar with the rest of the city.~
@109 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula district.~
@110 = ~NP: Then I have no questions.~ /*That's all the questions I have.*/
@111 = ~NP: Well, uh. the most prominent part of the neighborhood is the prison itself, you know? Anything interesting that happens there, it's got to have something to do with it. When I escaped, a gang of some guys that were in there took over the head warden. and the prison itself. There was something fishy about the whole thing.~ /*When I escaped, a bunch of the fellows being held there had taken the warden over... and the prison, too. There was something fishy about the whole thing.*/
@112 = ~Okey-dokey. We got plenty to keep us busy, anyway, I'm sure.~
@113 = ~You'd think the city guard would take control of the prison back... but they've got too much on their plate with the plague, I guess.~
@114 = ~Anything else?~
@115 = ~I think that's enough talking for now.~
@116 = ~No, I don't think so, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Best to avoid the district altogether.~
@117 = ~If we're to be companions I'd like to know more about you.~
@118 = ~I'd like you to continue your story from before, Tomi.~
@119 = ~NP: Well, there's not much to tell, <LADYLORD>. Tomi the Hangman is the most famous halfling rogue in all of Calimport.... and that's pretty much it. Oh, I have tales of treachery and deceit, like the ones the little Kalimshan children have been listening to with their mouths hanging open for years now... but I doubt you'd be interested.~ /*Oh, I've my tales of treachery and deceit, the likes of which have been told to wide-eyed little Calimshite children for many years... but I doubt you'd be interested in that.*/
@120 = ~Oh, go on. You know you want to tell me.~
@121 = ~You'll do what I say, rogue!~
@122 = ~You're right, I don't want to hear this.~
@123 = ~NP: Well, let's see what we've got. Tomi has had a bunch of friends and a bunch of enemies in his time. But only one was both at once: my archmistress, Samuel Nescladeha! Sammy and I were buddies in the good old days, when we used to run around unsupervised on the streets as small-time shooters - stealing avocados and pinching purses. But when I gained some fame myself, Sammy got a little jealous. Poor thing.~ /*Well, let's see. Tomi's had a bunch of friends and a bunch of enemies in his time. There's only been one who's been both: my arch-nemesis, Samuel Bumbleheart!*/
@124 = ~Wow, you get little bossy when you want a story, aye? Well, all right, have it your way.~
@125 = ~NP: Wow, let me see. why am I suddenly telling a story? Oh, I know! It was your idea! Shh. Well, whatever you say, <LADYLORD>. Just make sure your pants aren't wrinkled when we go.~ /*Gee, let me think... what might have made me offer to tell a story? Oh, I know! You asked for it! Sheesh.*/
@126 = ~Fame was always Sammy's thing. He's always loved attention, ever since he did that striptease in the half-orc bar to keep from being pummelled, I've always thought he was a bit of a diva.~
@127 = ~You seem to rather enjoy the fame, yourself.~
@128 = ~Why weren't you two a team?~
@129 = ~What did he do about it?~
@130 = ~Mmmm... naw, not so much. It's a bit hard to pick a pocket when you have twenty suspicious eyes on you. Great with the lasses, though, I'll admit.~
@131 = ~We used to be when we were tots, sure, but the plain fact is Sammy's not such a good rogue. So clumsy and wobbly, it's a shame to call him a halfling sometimes.~
@132 = ~NP: At first Sammy was happy with everything, but it just pissed him off that I was always the first to be recognized. If the guards chased me down the street, he'd whimper: "Why not me?" Oh, he tried to report me for stealing. Not very friendly, really, he only succeeded in getting himself imprisoned. In Kalimshan, that's practically the same as the death penalty.~ /*Oh, he tried to show me up as a thief. Not being very good, however, it only landed him in prison. In Calimshan, that means you're as good as hung.*/
@133 = ~I busted him out the first time, but that only embarrassed him. No good deed goes unpunished, you know... so Sammy had to take action!~
@134 = ~You think he'd be thankful for the help.~
@135 = ~Why didn't you leave him in prison?~
@136 = ~NP: Well, I didn't really mean to pull him out. It was an accident. the kind that took down half the prison and caused a mass escape. It happens at every turn, believe me. I don't know why Sammy's so worked up, really. It's like he's lost his mind. all that yelling, all that red face, it's really sad. In the end, Sammy only got away with a couple of broken legs... and he could even walk, though he limped. Was I the only one to blame?~ /*Well, the truth is I didn't really mean to break him out. It was an accident... the kind that brings down half the prison and causes a mass escape. Happens all the time, trust me.*/
@137 = ~At any rate, Sammy decided enough was enough. It was time to ruin his best pal, Tomi, once and for all.~
@138 = ~What did he do?~
@139 = ~You don't sound like his 'best pal'.~
@140 = ~I thought he just wanted to be famous?~
@141 = ~NP: Sammy's come up with a plan! Not the greatest plan, I suppose...but he was never a great schemer, either. His last plan, in fact, was a robbery that ended with him, naked and shivering, on a ship en route to Maztica. Well. true, I forgot to pick him up. but that was HIS plan. This plan, however, was quite different! Hee hee... at least that's what he thought. I'll have to tell you about it sometime, <LADYLORD>.~ /*His last plan, in fact, was a heist that ended up with him being left naked and cold on a ship to Maztica. Well... all right, I did forget to go pick him up... but it was HIS plan.*/
@142 = ~Of course I was! I mean... so what if I was the one who did the job he got arrested for? So what if I slept with his lady friend while he was in prison? We were buds!~
@143 = ~And what better way to become famous than to take down the notorious Tomi Undergallows!~
@144 = ~NP: That's right! I told you about Sammy's big plans to take old Tomi down, huh? Uh-huh, yeah. Well, Sammy's got a plan to get little Tomi thrown in jail. just like he was. He was gonna steal the most famous gem in Calimshan, and I was to be blamed!~ /*So Sammy concocts this plan to have l'il Tomi thrown in prison... just like he'd been. He was going to steal the most fabulous gem in Calimshan and I was to take the blame for it!*/
@145 = ~If he could steal it, wouldn't that make him famous?~
@146 = ~This Sammy sounds like a dastardly halfling.~
@147 = ~How could he make you take the blame?~
@148 = ~I didn't say that Sammy was the smartest halfling on the block. In his mind, having me stuck in a Calimshite prison and ravaged daily by burly convict cell-mates was worth almost any price.~
@149 = ~NP: Ahh, Sammy. He probably still resented me for stealing both his girlfriends. Um. actually, I took his wife, too. Nah, I don't think so, that was years and years ago. Anyway, since Sammy wasn't so skillful, he needed some help. He ended up getting involved with a rather nasty elf named Reegar.~ /*Ahhhh, Sammy. Maybe he still resented my stealing both his lady friends. Hmm... actually, I stole his wife, too. Naaaah, that was years and years before.*/
@150 = ~Well, with my reputation, who wouldn't believe him? For one of Sammy's plans, it was right brilliant. He was such an angry, angry little halfling.~
@151 = ~NP: Reegar was a good... and the meanest crook in Kalimshan, so Sammy had to practically become his servant to get him to agree. Reegar was also a pretty good buddy of mine, though Sammy didn't know it. Thing is, I'd been grinding my own teeth on that rock all along. When Reegar laid Sammy out, I laughed so hard I almost wet my pants.~ /*Reegar was good... he was also the meanest rogue in Calimshan, and Sammy had to practically become his servant to get him to agree. Reegar was also a pretty good pal of mine, though Sammy didn't know that.*/
@152 = ~I'm beginning to feel sorry for this Sammy fellow.~
@153 = ~So what did you do?~
@154 = ~Aye, well, he was a fellow to pity, at times. Once I remember I left Sammy in the Dark Bazaar by accident. He showed up three days later, pitch-white and devoid of hair. Ha ha! Those were the days...~
@155 = ~NP: I did the only thing I had left to do, of course. I made my own plan and began to prepare for the robbery. Until the night of the robbery, I never uttered a word about my knowledge of Sammy's scheme. He, of course, played the innocent... didn't say a word to me, even told me to get out. It was pretty slick, I'll grant you, but I saw right through him! Eventually, he stopped being my friend... and became my archmistress!~ /*Until the night of the heist, I didn't let on that I knew what Sammy was up to. He acted all innocent, of course... didn't say a word to me, even told me to get lost.*/
@156 = ~Your arch-nemesis?~
@157 = ~It sounds like you were HIS arch-nemesis.~
@158 = ~This is a very dumb story.~
@159 = ~NP: That's right! Like an insidious snake, he was hiding under the guise of a friend! I never would have suspected Sammy, the simpleton childhood friend I once pulled down my pants in front of the entire Molikai Girls' Choir! Nevertheless. I was just gonna teach Sammy a lesson. But what happened to him the night of the robbery was pretty tragic.~ /*Exactly! Like a cunning serpent, he had hidden himself as my friend! Never would I have suspected simple Sammy, the childhood pal I had de-pantsed in front of the Molikai girl's choir!*/
@160 = ~Oh no!~
@161 = ~Hee hee hee...~
@162 = ~I've heard enough.~
@163 = ~NP: What? What makes you think that? Well, uh. there was this one time when I told Rock Crusher that Sammy stole his hammer, not me, but Sammy forgave me after he was cured, I swear! Still. I was just gonna teach Sammy a lesson. But what happened to him the night of the robbery was pretty tragic.~ /*Wha-aat? Why would you think that? Well... there was that one time I told Rok the Crusher that Sammy stole his hammer, and not me, but Sammy forgave me after he healed, I swear!*/
@164 = ~NP: Stupid? What's so stupid about her? Friendship! Betrayal! It has all the classic motifs I promised! Not to mention the fact that I was the main victim. Still. I was only going to teach Sammy a lesson. But what happened to him the night of the robbery was pretty tragic.~ /*Dumb? What's so dumb about it? Friendship! Betrayal! It has all the classic elements I promised! The fact that I was the victim in all this is beside the point.*/
@165 = ~NP: Yeah, that's terrible. The only thing in my life that I really regret. I should tell you about it. sometime. *(Sighs) Let's, uh. let's just get back to your assignment. I can't think about Sammy anymore.~ /*I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let's... let's just go on with your quest. I don't want to think about Sammy any longer.*/
@166 = ~NP: Yeah, laugh if you want, <LADYLORD>, but it's really awful. The only thing in my life that I regret... I should tell you about it. sometime. <LADYLORD> Come on. let's just get back to your assignment. I can't think about Sammy anymore.~ /*I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let's... let's just go on with your quest. I don't want to think about Sammy any longer.*/
@167 = ~NP: Yeah, that's a tough one to hear about. It's awful. The only thing in my life that I really regret... I should tell you about it. sometime. *Let's, uh. let's just go back to your assignment. I can't think about Sammy anymore.~ /*I shall have to tell you about it... sometime. *Sigh* Let's... let's just go on with your quest. I don't want to think about Sammy any longer.*/
@168 = ~NP: Uh-huh. the night of the kidnapping, right? *I guess you're a good friend, <LADYLORD>. I can tell you all about it. The gemstone we targeted was none other than the famous 'Star of Kalimshan'. It's not the most expensive ruby in the country, but it is without a doubt one of the most famous.~ /*The gem we were after was no other than the fabled 'Star of Calimshan'. It's not the most valuable ruby in the land, but certainly one of the more notorious.*/
@169 = ~NP: According to legend, the pashas of Kalimshan used to give them to their wives on their first wedding night, and the stone glows from within.... filled with tears for their lost innocence. Well, at least that's the story. The daring plan is mine. and Sammin's. was to steal the stone from the depths of the royal palace, from the private quarters of the wife of the Sil Pasha herself.~ /*According to legend, the pashas of Calimshan gifted it to their wives on their wedding night, and the stone glows from within... filled with the tears of their lost innocence. Or so the story goes.*/
@170 = ~Why steal it if it wasn't valuable?~
@171 = ~What were you going to do to Sammy?~
@172 = ~Isn't that very dangerous for a young thief?~
@173 = ~NP: The value of the ruby consists chiefly in its glory, <LADYLORD>. Sil Pasha would know no rest until he had caught the man responsible for its theft. Anyway, the night came. Sammy and Rheegar sneaked into the palace first, with Sammy unaware of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was easy enough to follow.~ /*At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.*/
@174 = ~NP: I didn't really know. I still couldn't get over the fact that Sammy had turned into my archmystic for no reason at all. Anyway, the night came. Sammy and Rheegar snuck into the palace first, with Sammy unaware of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was easy enough to follow.~ /*At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.*/
@175 = ~NP: Oh, right. But that's nothing compared to the reaction of the Pasha's forces. It was one thing to steal it. it was quite another to live long enough to enjoy it. Anyway, the night came. Sammy and Reegar snuck into the palace first, Sammy unaware of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was easy enough to follow.~ /*At any rate, the night came. Sammy and Reegar stole into the palace ahead of me, with Sammy having no idea of my presence. Reegar left a trail that was quite easy to follow.*/
@176 = ~I remember being impressed at the time that things were going so well... no guards alerted, no problems whatsoever. I thought maybe Sammy's foul luck had finally turned, for once.~
@177 = ~And then?~
@178 = ~NP: And sure enough, Sammy caught a crease in the carpet and flew right into a knight's armor. He fell on top of it, dragging a couple of others with him, so that the resulting clang could have brought all the dead men up to Nebuchadnezzar's feet. Poor Reegar turned as white as a girl's ass when he saw the whole crowd of soldiers rushing down the corridor. He jumped out the window, not realizing we were just above the lion's enclosure. Poor guy.~ /*Well, of course Sammy tripped over a fold in the carpet and took a spill into a suit of armor. It fell over him into two others and the resulting clatter would have woken Nebuchadnezzar's dead brother-in-law.*/
@179 = ~What happened to Sammy?~
@180 = ~That's horrible!~
@181 = ~NP: The guards swept just past the pile of armor... without even thinking to look for the little halfling buried inside, luckily for Sammy. Anyway... to Sammy's credit for persistence, he got out from under the armor and went after the ruby. Caught me just as I was stealing it off the stand, actually.~ /*Anyway... give ol' Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.*/
@182 = ~NP: Oh, maybe. Not as bad as the time we tried to rob the merchants' guild and I hit a barrel of alchemical fire and burned all of Sammy's body hair. Anyway... I gotta hand it to Sammy for persistence, he got out from under his armor and went after the ruby. Caught me just as I was stealing it off the stand, actually.~ /*Anyway... give ol' Sammy some credit for stubbornness, he climbed out from under that armor and still came for the ruby. Found me plucking it from its pedestal, in fact.*/
@183 = ~He was surprised to see me, to say the least. I decided to give him a piece of my mind, as I recall. "Why, Sammy," I said, "why did you betray me? I've never done anything to you!"~
@184 = ~Oh, he must have liked that...~
@185 = ~But that's not true!~
@186 = ~Tomi, you're a cruel halfling.~
@187 = ~NP: I never got to hear his answer. Strangely enough, he turned purple, his eyes bulging, and he gurgled something indistinctly for a while. He looked like some kind of angry kobold. Immediately afterward, the guards came running in, and the sodom began. Everyone was fighting, yelling, running around. the last thing I remember is diving into the sea, and I woke up three days later on a freighter bound for Tapsult.~ /*The guards ran in just then and it was pandemonium. There was fighting and screaming and running... last I remember, I dived into the sea and woke up three days later on freighter bound for Tharsult.*/
@188 = ~What do you mean? Oh, I admit... I made one or two mistakes in the past, but Sammy and I were pals! Not anymore, of course, now that Sammy'd turned traitor.~
@189 = ~Want to hear the funny part? For all that Sammy was a terrible thief, he was a wonderful pickpocket. Stole the ruby off me, he did, and I had nothing to show for all that.~
@190 = ~NP: I'm not sure, to be honest. I heard he ended up on a ship to slave traders and was somehow sold to one of the High Chiefs in Luskan. Poor fool. As for me, I'd love to one day be on the trail of that ruby. The Star of Calimshan. ah-ah, it would still be worth it and make me famous.~ /*Not sure, exactly. I'd heard he'd ended up on a slave ship and somehow got sold to one of the High Captains in Luskan. Poor sod.*/
@191 = ~I have a ruby, here. Is this what you're looking for?~
@192 = ~Perhaps we'll find your ruby sometime.~
@193 = ~Just don't let it interfere with your obligation to me.~
@194 = ~By Brandobaris's hairy feet! It is! Where in Faerun did you find that?~
@195 = ~I found it in a wizard's tower, along the South Road.~
@196 = ~Thanks, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>! You're quite a friend, yourself! Now let's get on with your quest, shall we?~
@197 = ~Ahhh, no worries, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>! We'll find your cultists, sure enough... Sammy can wait.~
@198 = ~NP: Ho. That's how Sammy got here in the end. Probably mucking about in some wizard's kitchen until he fell into some ale barrel and drowned. Ah, there's nothing to say. Thank you for this find, <LADYLORD>. a beautiful piece of jewelry for my robe. I mean, if I had a robe. I wish I had something other than dust in my pockets to repay t'e. All I can offer in return is my gratitude and friendship.~ /*Huh. So Sammy did make it up hereabouts, after all. Probably slaved away in some wizard's kitchen until he slipped into a vat of ale and drowned. Ah, well.*/
@199 = ~Hmm... I'm not sure I want your friendship, considering what happened to Sammy...~
@200 = ~That's fine, Tomi. It's more than enough.~
@201 = ~NP: You get the point, <LADYLORD>. Now let's find your sectarians and kick some fanatical ass! By the way, check out that ring I gave you once.~ /*You have a point there, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt!*/
@202 = ~NP: You get the point, <LADYLORD>. Now let's find your sectarians and kick some fanatical ass! By the way, I've got a ring here, take it, maybe you could use it.~ /*You have a point there, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt!*/
@203 = ~NP: You are a <MALEFEMALE> of great kindness. Now let's find your sectarians and kick some bigoted ass! By the way, check out that ring I gave you once.~ /*You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt!*/
@204 = ~NP: You are a <MALEFEMALE> of great kindness. Now let's find your sectarians and kick some fanatical ass! By the way, I've got a ring here, take it, maybe you could use it.~ /*You're a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Now let's find your cultists and kick some zealot butt!*/
@205 = ~Ha! There's not much more to it. One of these days, I'll find the Star of Calimshan. Maybe find out what happened to Sammy, too... I've decided to forgive him.~
@206 = ~You're all heart, Tomi.~
@207 = ~Ain't that the truth! It takes a special kind of man to have that much forgiveness in his heart. I think Sammy will be pleased.~
@208 = ~Nahhh, this isn't the time, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. We have cultists to find and cut into little cultist-sized bits, don't we?~
@209 = ~NP: Well, if I was a cult, you know where I'd hide? Luskan. In the City of Sails, home to every pirate, smuggler, lawyer, and all sorts of other crap north of Waterdeep. I say, who'd notice a couple extra killers in a place like that? Last time I was there, if people weren't being gutted in the streets by pirates, the High Chiefs were.~ /*Well, if I was a cult, you know where I would hide? Luskan. The City of Sails, home to every pirate, smuggler, lawyer and all-around ne'er-do-well north of Waterdeep.*/
@210 = ~High Captains?~
@211 = ~That's enough information for now.~
@212 = ~NP: Yeah. There's five of them, High Chiefs, all ex-pirates, now ruling with an iron fist. I have no idea why there's five of them instead of one. Actually, they're not the ones who actually rule Luskan. Anyone who's even the slightest bit familiar with Luskan knows that it's the Secret Brotherhood that spins all the wheels there.~ /*Mind you, they don't really rule Luskan. Anyone who knows anything about Luskan knows that the Arcane Brotherhood really runs the show.*/
@213 = ~Tell me about the Arcane Brotherhood.~
@214 = ~Hokey-dokey. You go do your hero thing, then.~
@215 = ~NP: Oh, just some bunch of evil wizards obsessed with ruling the world. You know, it's always been about wizards. They've got some guy in charge called the Secret Archmage, I think. If I remember correctly, they all huddle in the Great Tower - it's not on the coast, but on a small island. Never sticks out, very secretive... that sort of thing.~ /*Ahhh, it's just some group of evil wizards bent on dominating the world. You know... the usual wizard stuff. They're led by some guy called the 'Archmage Arcane', I think.*/
@216 = ~NP: Well, Luskan isn't exactly a welcoming place. especially for us lowlifes. Mostly it's a gathering place for the most disgusting human scum who have nowhere else to go. If the sectarians are there, they could be anywhere, I guess. But I think someone in Luskan might know something.~ /*Well, Luskan's not a very welcoming place... especially for us demi-humans. It's mostly all just really nasty human folk with no better place to be.*/
@217 = ~Have you always been a rogue, Tomi?~
@218 = ~NP: I look forward to the continuation of your story.~ /*You go on with you story then.*/
@219 = ~NP: Funny you should ask, <LADYLORD>. I was a little rascal from the streets of Calimport, from the beginning and for the most part that's where I picked up my street smarts... but it wasn't always that way. Truth be told, when I was still an inexperienced young man, a kind man, a wizard, saw great potential in me and took me in. I was his apprentice and, in truth, for quite a long time.~ /*Funny you should ask that, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. I was an urchin on the streets of Calimport, first an' foremost... and that's where I learned me street-smarts... but it wasn't always that way.*/
@220 = ~That's where I met my best friend Sammy, after all... he was another apprentice. I would have been a full wizard, myself, if things had worked out.~
@221 = ~What went wrong?~
@222 = ~You? A wizard? You must be joking!~
@223 = ~NP: Well, you know. you can get a guy off the street, but you can't get the street out of a guy. I wasn't good with books and teaching and all that. This wizard... what was his name? Halazar? He saw something in me that I'd never seen before. Said I was gonna be a wizard whether I wanted to be or not.~ /*That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.*/
@224 = ~NP: Here you are laughing at me, aren't you, <LADYLORD>? Ha ha! True enough, though. When it came to books and teachings, I was like a sahuagin in the desert. That wizard... what was his name? Halazar? He saw something in me that I'd never seen before. Said I'd be a wizard whether I wanted to be or not.~ /*That wizard... what was his name? Halasahr? He saw something in me that I never saw. Said I would make a wizard whether I liked it or not.*/
@225 = ~I thought I would make a wonderful thief if I could be invisible and fly around all the time... I just couldn't wait! Halasahr had all these pretty things in his tower, unfortunately.~
@226 = ~So you stole them?~
@227 = ~I'm sure he meant the best for you.~
@228 = ~You're far too impatient, Tomi.~
@229 = ~NP: Of course I stole them! What kind of a crook would I be otherwise? I made good money on the streets, too, even though Halazar wouldn't leave a mark on me when I came back. One time I snagged a book of spells from Khalazar and sold it for good money. Mommy, the old peppers went wild! By the time I got back, a storm cloud had gathered over the tower.~ /*Once I swiped Halasahr's spellbook and sold that for a pretty price. Boy, was the old man furious! There was a storm brewing around his tower by the time I got back!*/
@230 = ~NP: Well, it may look that way from the outside, but old Halazar was quite a teacher. One wrong line and you'd be covered in bruises for a week! He should have been a fighter, with a kick like that. One time I snagged a book of spells from Khalazar and sold it for good money. Oh, my God, the old man went crazy. By the time I got back, a storm cloud had gathered over the tower.~ /*Well, you may think so, but ol' Halasahr was quite the taskmaster. One line mispronounced and I'd be black and blue for days! He should have been a fighter with that arm.*/
@231 = ~NP: You sound just like him. Oh! He used to beat me up! He wasn't very patient himself, you know. One time I snatched up a Chalazar spell book and sold it for good money. Oh, my God, the old man went crazy. By the time I got back, there was a storm cloud over the tower.~ /*Once I swiped Halasahr's spellbook and sold that for a pretty price. Boy, was the old man furious! There was a storm brewing around his tower by the time I got back!*/
@232 = ~Of course I had to lie and say that Sammy took the book. Hmmm... come to think of it, that's how Sammy got kicked out of his apprenticeship.~
@233 = ~You got your friend kicked out?~
@234 = ~NP: Well, he wasn't much of a wizard. and anyway, Sammy wasn't really my friend then. I made up for it later, when I became his friend - after I stopped studying. Hehe... how my apprenticeship ended is a separate story. I should tell you sometime, <LADYLORD>, if you're interested. But it'll have to wait. We have to save the city now, right?~ /*Well, he wasn't much of a wizard... and ol' Sammy wasn't my friend back then, anyway. I made it up to him by becoming his pal later, once I stopped being an apprentice.*/
@235 = ~NP: Did I tell a story? Oh, yes. about how my apprenticeship with Halazar ended. Well, wizards are funny people, you know. No self-respecting thief would stick his nose where he'd be cut off without question, but wizards are like butterflies on fire. Halazar was the same way. He didn't want me to know, of course, but I snuck all over his tower... and I've seen him summon demons.~ /*Well, wizards are a funny lot, you know. No self-respecting thief would go poking his nose into places where it's sure to get cut off, but wizards run like moths into bonfires.*/
@236 = ~Demons? So he was an evil man, then.~
@237 = ~Why would he be summoning demons?~
@238 = ~You know what a demon looks like, I take it?~
@239 = ~NP: I don't know about evil. We're talking about Kalimshan here, actually. I've known a couple of aristocratic bachelors who had a succubus as a maid. Anyway, this demon seemed pretty harmless. He and Halazar laughed about something, and then he tickled the mage's belly until he started giggling like a schoolgirl.~ /*Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.*/
@240 = ~NP: Well, why do wizards summon demons? Power, knowledge, to use a succubus? Who knows? Maybe he needed a chess partner. Anyway, this demon seemed pretty harmless. He and Halazar laughed about something, and then he tickled the wizard's belly until he started giggling like a schoolgirl.~ /*Anyway, this demon seemed harmless enough. Halasahr and it had some laughs, and it tickled the mage's belly until he was giggling like a schoolgirl.*/
@241 = ~NP: Sure thing. Big, red, bat wings, bad breath, hell of a contract. Hell, that was in the first paragraph of 'Fundamentals of Magic'. I'm from Kalimshan, you know. Anyway, this demon seemed pretty harmless. He and Halazar laughed about something, and then he tickled the mage's belly until he started giggling like a schoolgirl.~ /*Sure. Big, red, bat wings, bad breath, infernal contract. Shoot, that was in the opening paragraph of 'the Apprentice Essentials'. I am from Calimshan, you know.*/
@242 = ~So after Halasahr dismissed it and left, I decided I would call up this demon and see just how much riches he could give me. It really didn't seem like such a big thing at the time.~
@243 = ~You consorted with a demon?~
@244 = ~Why would you think a demon could make you rich?~
@245 = ~No! You didn't!!~
@246 = ~NP: Shh, you make it sound like he and I got married and ran off to the jets to enjoy married bliss. Hell, I only summoned him once, <LADYLORD>. So, I read a piece from a magic book and summoned a demon, huh? Well... the demon was obviously very surprised when he saw me - he started bellowing, and bellowing, and bellowing. I asked him what the hell he saw that was so funny, right? He says, "Why you little baby?!" He had this loud, booming voice.... and all I could think was 'mom, I'm gonna have HUNDREDS of money!'~ /*I ask him what's so damn funny, right? He says, "Why you, little one!" He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is 'boy, I am gonna be SO rich!'*/
@247 = ~NP: Well, they're supposed to grant three wishes, aren't they? If you rub their tummy or something? You know, I've never been much of a student. So I read a piece of the magic book and summoned a demon, huh? Well, uh. the demon was obviously very surprised when he saw me - he started bellowing, and bellowing, and bellowing. I asked him what the hell he saw that was so funny, right? He says, "Why you, little man?!" He had this loud, booming voice.... and all I could think was 'mom, I'm gonna have HUNDREDS of money!'~ /*I ask him what's so damn funny, right? He says, "Why you, little one!" He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is 'boy, I am gonna be SO rich!'*/
@248 = ~NP: Why would I do that?! I mean. the bottle just stood there, all alone. If that Halazar was a responsible wizard, he would have locked it up properly. So it's not my fault what I did. So I read a piece of magic and summoned a demon, huh? Well, uh. the demon was obviously very surprised when he saw me - he started bawling, and bawling, and bawling. I asked him what the hell he saw that was so funny, right? He says, "Why you, little man?!" He had this loud, booming voice.... and all I could think was 'mom, I'm gonna have HUNDREDS of money!'~ /*I ask him what's so damn funny, right? He says, "Why you, little one!" He has this big, booming voice... and all I can think is 'boy, I am gonna be SO rich!'*/
@249 = ~NP: Well, I yelled at him and demanded that he make me rich, right? And he laughed again. So I said, I'd rather he make me powerful. and I thought that might be a good thing, too. So he laughed again! Eventually he calmed down and said 'okay' and gave me a magic rod. Said it would give me all the power I needed.... "poof! - and disappeared. Damn, that wand got me in so much trouble....~ /*Well, I shout at him and demand that he make me rich, right? And he laughs again. So I say he better make me powerful, then... figuring that's maybe just as good.*/
@250 = ~Why? What did it do?~
@251 = ~Remind me not to give you any magic treasure.~
@252 = ~I just can't believe you some times...~
@253 = ~NP: Heh... I'll have to tell you sometime later, I guess, what that rod was doing. It's only worth noting that Halazar didn't like it. Anyway. I'm sure we have more important things to do right now. Right, <LADYLORD>?~ /*Heh... I'll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe. Let's just say Halasahr wasn't happy about it.*/
@254 = ~NP: Hey! I'm good with my magic! Well, uh. usually. Okay, forget it. Heh. I guess I'll have to tell you sometime later what that rod was doing. It's just worth noting that Halazar didn't like it. Anyway. I'm sure we have more important things to do right now. Right, <LADYLORD>?~ /*Heh... I'll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe. Let's just say Halasahr wasn't happy about it.*/
@255 = ~NP: Why? It was perfectly innocent. After all, who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth? Heh. I guess I'll have to tell you what that rod did sometime later. It's only worth noting that Halazar didn't like it. Anyway. I'm sure we have more important things to do right now. Right, <LADYLORD>?~ /*Heh... I'll have to tell you what the wand did sometime later, maybe. Let's just say Halasahr wasn't happy about it.*/
@256 = ~NP: Ahh, I guess it won't do any harm. It was such a horror though, <LADYLORD>. If you remember, the little demon gave me the rod, huh? So, with the demon gone, I figured I should check it out. It was so exciting... I had the power at my disposal! I had to complete my apprenticeship assignments, and I figured the rod would do them for me!~ /*Aye, exactly. It was exhilirating, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>... the power at my disposal! I had my apprentice chores to do, and I decided the wand should do them for me!*/
@257 = ~NP: I animated the broom to do my bidding and it started sweeping the floors! I used my rod to make a bucket that never ran out of water! I made tables walk, cauldrons dance, chairs waltz..... it was marvelous! I waved my wand and all things came to life!~ /*I animated a broom to do my bidding, and it began to clean the floors! I used the wand to make a bucket that never ran short of water!*/
@258 = ~So what went wrong?~
@259 = ~There's no wand that does that.~
@260 = ~What did the wizard think of this?~
@261 = ~NP: Well, uh. the first problem was the broom. Floors weren't enough for her. She started sweeping shelves, dropping jalazar ingredients, breaking things. I couldn't stop her! In a panic, I chopped up the broom with an axe... and then both halves became brooms! I kept chopping and chopping..... suddenly the whole room was filled with brooms! They broke everything!~ /*In a panic, I hacked the broom apart with an axe... but then both halves became brooms! I kept hacking and hacking... and suddenly the room was filled with brooms! They were breaking everything!*/
@262 = ~Oh, you think so, do you? When was the last time you summoned up a big demon who gave you a gift, huh? Happens all the time, does it?~
@263 = ~Well, he wasn't around, naturally. Considering the source of the wand, I didn't exactly want to advertise it.~
@264 = ~NP: In my haste, I turned the bucket over..... and suddenly the tower began to fill with water! The table attacked me... there was nothing I could do! The whole tower was collapsing! Chaos! Chaos! Oh, good people! And then Halazar came back.~ /*In my haste, I knocked over the bucket... and suddenly the tower began filling up with water! The table was attacking me... I couldn't do anything! The tower was being destroyed! Chaos! Chaos! Oh, the humanity!*/
@265 = ~I can't imagine he was pleased.~
@266 = ~Did he try to kill you?~
@267 = ~NP: No... no, he wasn't pleased. He looked down at me, so furious and disappointed. He was so horrible, I thought I was going to pee my pants on the spot. He took the rod from me and broke it. and all the madness stopped immediately. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me. practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.~ /*He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.*/
@268 = ~NP: Well, no. he wasn't trying to kill me. He looked at me like that, so disappointed and angry. I thought I was gonna pee my pants. He took the rod from me and broke it. and all the craziness stopped immediately. Oh, and he yelled, he yelled at me. practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.~ /*He snatched the wand from me and he broke it... and that made all the madness stop. Oh, and he yelled and yelled at me... he practically threw me out of the tower and told me never to come back.*/
@269 = ~The bright news is, I hear Halasahr told some writer about it and the writer thought it was so amusing, he made a play! Think it will be a musical?~
@270 = ~That's horrible! Don't you feel bad at all?~
@271 = ~Well, I would have killed you.~
@272 = ~Just when I think you won't get any stranger...~
@273 = ~NP: You know, I'm actually kind of sorry about that. Not because of myself. I knew I wasn't a wizard. It's because of Halazar. He's been pretty good to me, all things considered. He lost a bunch of rare components that night. The trouble with these ashes. the ashes of a great warrior. It's for his longevity potion. I always thought I could fix it someday. maybe find him those ashes. If he hasn't already died of old age.~ /*You know, I do feel a bit bad about the whole thing. Not for me... I knew I was no wizard. I feel bad for Halasahr. He did treat me pretty good, all things considered.*/
@274 = ~I have these ashes of an Uthgardt hero... would they serve?~
@275 = ~We may come across some ashes, who knows?~
@276 = ~Keep your mind on your duty to me.~
@277 = ~I really doubt Halasahr would be happy with that...~
@278 = ~NP: Well... maybe it'll work, actually. Let me think about it. Aha... aha, I think it's perfect for the Khalazar longevity potion! Thank you, <LADYLORD>. Well. since you're such a friend, let me give you this. It's a powerful ring I stole from Sammy once. Maybe you could use it.~ /*Thank you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Here... since you're such a friend, let me give you this. It's a powerful ring that I stole from Sammy way back. Maybe you could use it.*/
@279 = ~That's it? A ring?~
@280 = ~Aye, who knows? Either way, I'm happy toodling along after you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Lead on!~
@281 = ~Oh, keep your knickers on, already. I said I'd come along with ya, didn't I? Sheesh. Some people's children.~
@282 = ~But you never know, do you? Heck... maybe I could even track my old friend Sammy down one day. Think he'd be happy to see me?~
@283 = ~NP: Yeah, that's not a problem, <LADYLORD>.... the least I could do. The only thing out of everything I stole from Sammy is valuable enough for me to keep it. I'll send those ashes to Halazar as soon as I get a chance. Hmm. I wonder if he accepts students my age.~ /*Aye, it's not a problem, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>... least I could do. It's the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep.*/
@284 = ~You want to become a wizard now?~
@285 = ~Oh... I wouldn't look him up, if I were you.~
@286 = ~You're not going anywhere!~
@287 = ~NP: Well, uh. it's the only thing I stole from Sammy that's valuable enough for me to keep. I got rid of the rest of the stuff a long time ago. Must be worth something. I'll send those ashes to Halazar as soon as I get a chance. Hmm. I wonder if he accepts students my age.~ /*Well... it's the only thing I stole off Sammy that was valuable enough for me to keep. The rest of the stuff I got rid of long time ago. That should be worth something.*/
@288 = ~NP: Of course! Why not? With a little magic on hand, I could be the greatest thief known to Kalimport! Again! Ha ha! Well, on your way then, my friend! We will find your Words of Power and put an end to evil..... for more adventures await us later, I'm sure!!!~ /*Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!*/
@289 = ~NP: Oh, why not? You don't think he's still sulking, do you? I could learn from him and become the greatest thief known to Kalimport! Again! Ha-ha! Well, on your way then, my friend! We will find your Words of Power and put an end to evil..... for there will be more adventures to come, I'm sure of it.~ /*Oh, why not? You don't think he'd still hold a grudge do you? I could learn from him and become the greatest thief Calimport has ever known! Again! Ha ha!*/
@290 = ~NP: Oh, don't trouble your head with that, <LADYLORD>. I'm not leaving until your assignment is taken care of in the best possible way. Well, on your way then, my friend! We will find your Words of Power and put an end to evil..... for there will be more adventures to come, I'm sure!!!~ /*Let's get under way, then, my friend! We'll find your Words of Power and put an end to evil... for even more adventure awaits us afterwards, I'm sure of it!!*/
@291 = ~NP: Well, uh. I've thought about it. I'd really like to find those ashes someday. the ashes of a warrior hero. I owe it to Halazar, don't you think? Anyway, I've decided to stay by your side until you finish your mission. Maybe we'll find the ashes. Maybe it's meant to be.~ /*Well... I've been thinking about it. I'd really like to find those ashes sometime... the ashes of a warrior hero. I owe it to Halasahr, don't you think?*/
@292 = ~Maybe later, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Right now we've got stuff that needs doing, don't we?~
@293 = ~Whoa... I don't know much about these areas, myself. I'm just following you, remember, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>? Although I guess I know a bit about the Coldwood...~
@294 = ~Why? What do you know about Coldwood?~
@295 = ~NP: Well, I traveled there a few months ago. Paired with a guide, a little gnome, he kept going on and on about the places we passed. Honestly, it was impossible to shut the little asshole up. Anyway, he mentioned some ruins in the woods. Also old, old, just ancient. One of them belonged to a sorceress, a collector of oddities... maybe she had a way with words? I don't know.~ /*Anyway, he mentioned a few ruins in the woods. Really old ones, too. One of them belonged to a wizard who collected strange things... maybe she was fond of words? I don't know.*/
@296 = ~More?~
@297 = ~NP: There are some orcs in those parts that serve some great leader - he calls himself a king. Obold something. Ruthless and vile guy. I heard they used to attack merchants and caravans and stuff. Maybe they have something to do with the cult, or maybe they know something about those magic words. I think it's worth a shot.~ /*I hear they've been busy attacking merchants and caravans an' the like. Maybe they're mixed up with the cult, an' maybe they know more about them magic words. Worth a shot, I suppose.*/
@298 = ~My guide said there's lots of places in the Coldwood which are really old, places where nobody goes anymore. If these Words of Power are old and lost... I don't know, maybe it's the place to look for 'em.~
@299 = ~Huh. So all this is finally gettin' close to the end, is it? You can hear that fat lady clearin' her throat already. Mind if I ask ya a question, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>?~ [NWTOMIHD]
@300 = ~What is it, Tomi?~
@301 = ~Make it quick, halfling.~
@302 = ~I don't have time for your nonsense.~
@303 = ~Well... what are your thoughts on death? You know... the permanent kind.~
@304 = ~Are you afraid of dying, Tomi?~
@305 = ~I don't intend to die.~
@306 = ~This is not the time for a philosophical discussion.~
@307 = ~It's not nonsense! It's a, umm... what do ya call it? It's a serious question.~
@308 = ~Well, that's new. Spit it out.~
@309 = ~I said forget it.~
@310 = ~I dunno. I've never given it much thought. There seems to be major potential here for me to wet my breeches over, ya know.~
@311 = ~Are you backing out on me, then?~
@312 = ~Don't worry, Tomi. You're too lucky to die.~
@313 = ~Pull yourself together, already.~
@314 = ~Well that's easy for YOU to say. I'm the sidekick, remember? The sidekicks ALWAYS die.~
@315 = ~Really? Seems like the perfect time, if ya ask me. As a matter of fact, I could sit here and talk about it alllll day...~
@316 = ~NP: Whoa! How cranky are we? Did someone steal your oatmeal? Must be the nerves. I know what you mean. I have to admit, I've been waiting all day for this. Now let's go and kill that damn lizard! That's it!~ /*Whoa! A bit touchy, ain't we? Somebody steal your oatmeal? I bet it's just nerves... I know what ya mean.*/
@317 = ~NP: Leave? Are you kidding me? Miss the battle of the century? Miss out on all that fame and fortune, the opportunity to be adored by half-breed girls everywhere? I guess if I do stretch my legs, I'll be glad to meet Brandobaris, and finally pull up Arvorin's skirt in the netherworld. And maybe Sammy will be there, too! And if I don't die, I'll be a hero! Either way, it's a good thing!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!*/
@318 = ~NP: You know what? You're right! I am too lucky to die! After all, it's Undergallows' destiny to be rich and adored by halfling girls all over Faerûn! I guess if I do stretch my legs, I'll be glad to meet Brandobaris, and finally pull up Arvorin's skirt in the netherworld. And maybe Sammy will be there too! And if I don't die, I'll be a hero! Either way, it's a good thing!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!*/
@319 = ~NP: You always have an answer for everything, don't you? You're very good at flattery, ha ha! I think if I do stretch my legs, I'll be glad to meet Brandobaris, and finally pull up Arvorin's skirt in the netherworld. And maybe Sammy will be there too! And if I don't die, I'll be a hero! Either way, it's a good thing!~ /*I guess if I do kick the bucket, I'll have to be satisfied with meeting Brandobaris and pantsing Arvoreen in the afterlife. And maybe Sammy will be there! And if I don't die: I'm a hero! It's all good!*/
@320 = ~NP: You always have an answer for everything, don't you? Ahhh, there's the Undergallows' charm at work. You lust after me, it's obvious. Oh, well, that's all right. I guess if I do stretch my legs, I'll be glad to meet Brandobaris, and finally pull up Arvorin's skirt in the netherworld. And maybe Sammy will be there, too! And if I don't die, I'll be a hero!

@321 = ~Ya know, you aren't so bad, yourself. You'll make a fine hero one day, if I don't miss my guess.~
@322 = ~So glad you approve.~
@323 = ~Watch it, or I kill you myself.~
@324 = ~Let's just move on...~
@325 = ~Ya know, you aren't so bad, yourself. You'll make some lad a fine wife some day, I bet.~
@326 = ~I hear ya. Now let's go teach that lizard bitch to stay dead! Woot!~
@327 = ~Eh. Not really, nah. You know what to do, don't ya?~
