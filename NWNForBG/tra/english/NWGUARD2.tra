@0 = ~Hail, good <SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Peninsula is a dangerous place and we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders. I assume you have proper quarantine clearance to enter the District?~ /*Hail, good <SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates. The Peninsula is a dangerous place and we're restricting access on Lady Aribeth's orders.*/
@1 = ~Lady Aribeth has assigned me to temporary militia duty.~
@2 = ~What kind of clearance do I need?~
@3 = ~Why do I need clearance?~
@4 = ~Sorry, no.~
@5 = ~Aye, there was word she'd be hiring on adventurers to help fill the ranks. What can I do for you then?~
@6 = ~Could you answer some questions about the Peninsula district?~
@7 = ~I've got some general questions that need answers...~
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~We're under pretty tight lockdown right now. Unless you have the express permission of either Lady Aribeth or Lord Nasher, you'll have to remain in the Core.~
@10 = ~Look, the Wailing Death isn't a joke. I don't even want to think of the number of dead. I heard Lord Nasher has even come down with it. We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.~ /*We have no cure, not yet, so we're doing the only thing we know how to do. Limit movement, limit exposure. In other words... you'd better have clearance.*/
@11 = ~Then don't waste my time.~
@12 = ~I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.~
@13 = ~Can you tell me anything about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@14 = ~What do you know of the Wailing Death?~
@15 = ~Are you familiar with Lady Aribeth?~
@16 = ~Be careful. There's plenty of danger afoot.~
@17 = ~Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages. He had the symbol of Helm, god of all us guard-folk, gripped tightly in his frozen palm. We buried him with it that way... to honor him.~ /*Aye, my friend Haggard was with the night watch in the Academy when the caravan bringing the creatures came in. We found him with his throat slit after the attack, amidst the empty cages.*/
@18 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Waterdhavian creatures?~
@19 = ~Do you know anything else about what happened that night?~
@20 = ~Too little to cure it, too much to live without fear. Our only hope is to find those Waterdhavian creatures. Without them, every last one of us is dead.~
@21 = ~Is there anyone else who might know more about the Wailing Death?~
@22 = ~I'm interested in the plague. Can you tell me anything else about it.~
@23 = ~Can't say I know her as well as Abbot Fenthick, har har! But, aye, she has been a pillar of this community since she was knighted.~
@24 = ~Is there anyone else who might be able to tell me more about her?~
@25 = ~Something about her fascinates me. Can you tell me anything more?~
@26 = ~The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*The person who knows the most about it is probably Lady Aribeth, herself. She's a good soul and deadly smart, too. I'm glad she's in charge of the search.*/
@27 = ~I have some questions about the Peninsula district.~
@28 = ~The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*The rest, as they say, is history. Freed from their cages, the Waterdhavian creatures fled into the night and are out there still, hiding from us all.*/
@29 = ~You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*You might want to check with the Helmite, Desther. He's new here but has been putting his own health at risk to offer Helm's blessings to the plague-struck.*/
@30 = ~Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*Only that I've lost half my family to it by now. I stand guard in their memory.*/
@31 = ~If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know... Might there be something else you need?~ /*If you want the dirt on Lady Aribeth, you'd best talk to good sir Fenthick. They're due to be married in the summer, you know...*/
@32 = ~I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this. Is there something else you need, then?~ /*I'm afraid not. We must respect a person's privacy, especially in sad times such as this.*/
@33 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
@34 = ~Is there any way I can help out in there?~
@35 = ~How bad is it in there?~
@36 = ~Are there any places I should look out for in the Peninsula district?~
@37 = ~Would you mind answering some more general questions for me?~
@38 = ~Hmm, I don't think there's much to do anymore. The problem in the prison has been dealt with, as far as I know.~
@39 = ~Well, Commander Sebile came tearing through here on militia orders a while back... but I probably shouldn't be talking about that. There are enough rumors in this city already without me adding to them.~
@40 = ~Look, I'm here to help, remember?~
@41 = ~Not so bad anymore. I'm not sure what all happened, but I understand that the prisoners have been dealt with. It's pretty quiet now. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*Not so bad anymore. I'm not sure what all happened, but I understand that the prisoners have been dealt with. It's pretty quiet now.*/
@42 = ~It's pretty bad - I certainly wouldn't go in unequipped. Gate Captain Kipp can brief you once you're on the other side. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*It's pretty bad - I certainly wouldn't go in unequipped. Gate Captain Kipp can brief you once you're on the other side.*/
@43 = ~There's not much there, to be honest. With the prison at the top of the rise and all, most reputable folk and businesses steer clear. You should probably talk to Gate Captain Kipp on the other side - he can fill you in.~
@44 = ~I suppose you're right... Apparently there's been a bit of a prison break. She got sent in to mop up. If you want to know more about it, I suggest you talk to Commander Sebile in person. She'll have a temporary headquarters set up somewhere in the District. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*If you want to know more about it, I suggest you talk to Commander Sebile in person. She'll have a temporary headquarters set up somewhere in the District.*/
@45 = ~NP: Greetings, <SIRMAAM>! The Howling Death has taken many lives beyond these gates. The peninsula is a dangerous area, we are now restricting access by order of Lady Aribeth, but you may pass through~ /*Hail, good <SIRMAAM>!

@46 = ~NP: Greetings, <SIRMAAM>! Howling Death has taken many lives beyond these gates. The peninsula is a dangerous area, but things are much better now. I don't know what happened there, but it looks like the fugitive criminals have been dealt with.~ /*Hail, good <SIRMAAM>! The Wailing Death has taken a heavy toll beyond these gates.
