@0 = ~I'll be good! Please don't hurt me!~ [NWSHA058]
@1 = ~Shaldrissa, right? I'm <CHARNAME> and your father sent me to rescue you.~
@2 = ~Shaldrissa, right? Your father sent me to rescue you.~
@3 = ~I will rescue you.~
@4 = ~Wait right here.~
@5 = ~Rescue? (sob) Wait, you... you're the one who saved Neverwinter. Does this mean the gods have forgiven me? Is it possible, despite my stupidity? I shouldn't have believed him! It was going to be a grand adventure and I would be a true hero... like you. Oh, gods! I'll never be able to return home.~ 
@6 = ~Settle down and tell me what's going on here.~
@7 = ~Save the story for your father. You must go now.~
@8 = ~I will. (sob)~
@9 = ~*Sob* I'm sorry. I'm calm now and I'll tell you what happened.~
@10 = ~After you started returning with the ears of the other prisoners, I was approached by a man in a cloak. He said that he knew I was looking for adventure. He talked strangely but he was nice to me. It all seemed so mysterious and exciting. He gave me wine and we talked about how he was a Count from Waterdeep who was framed for a crime he didn't commit and had escaped from prison.~ 
@11 = ~You fell for that old story?~
@12 = ~Do you think you've had enough mystery in your life now?~
@13 = ~(sob) I'm so afraid to face my father. I... I wish I had listened to him in the first place. Thank you for rescuing a foolish child. Goodbye and good luck <SIRMAAM>.~
@14 = ~I don't know why I believed him. Maybe it was the wine. I guess he just fit my childish image of a noble hero. We snuck away at night and travelled to the mines. There were all these horrible orcs waiting for us and when I went to ask him what was going on, he just laughed and knocked me down. Then he... he did things to me... I... I can't talk about it.~ 
@15 = ~I figured out who he was. I had heard my father talk about him. Yesgar told me that he was going to hold me for ransom and once he had bled the town dry, he was going to take me away to sell into slavery. I should never have gone with him! My father must be so worried! (sob) I'm sorry... so sorry. (sob)~ 
@16 = ~It's all over now. You should be safe to go home.~
@17 = ~Yesgar told me that you were the one who planned this and wanted the money.~
@18 = ~Oh, yes. I want to be back in boring, old Port Llast. I like boring now. I'll never want mystery again.~
@19 = ~What?! I would never do something like that to my father or to Port Llast! I know I had a bad attitude, <CHARNAME>, but they are still my family and friends. I would never wish them ill.~
@20 = ~Hmm. Well, you seem sincere, but it's your father's problem now. You can go home to him.~
@21 = ~I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt! I just want to go home! (sob)~ [NWSHA055]
@22 = ~I must be going. My father wishes me to stay in our house for awhile. I can't really say I blame him. Goodbye!~ [NWSHA060]
@23 = ~Home! This town means everything to me! Thank you for saving me, <CHARNAME>. I will never do anything so foolish again!~ [NWSHA056]
