@0 = ~By the dim light of the candelabra, you can decipher the book's ragged text...~
@1 = ~NP: My attempts to summon the demon Belial, Lord of Fire, continue. It is difficult work, and my robe has ended up looking like a half-burned rag smeared with ash.... But I must continue, for only Belial knows the location of the phylactery I seek, a vessel that only the gods can destroy...~ /*"My research into the summoning of the demon Belial, Lord of Fire, continues. It is rugged work and my robes are little more than ashen rags as a result..."*/

@3 = ~Leave it.~
@4 = ~NP: Yes, Belial is a Fire Lord, which means that in addition to the usual Defense Against Evil, you need fire to summon him. I'm pretty sure the right reagent would be the belly of a fire beetle, but what's the right spell to cast? I've cast all the high-level fire spells over this roaster, and no effect! I've even tried the medium level spells, but no effect either!~ /*"Yes, Belial is the Lord of Fire so, aside from the customary casting of Protection from Evil, it shall also take fire to summon him. I am sure that the belly of the fire beetle is the proper reagent, but what spell?"*/
@5 = ~"There is but one fire spell left of all those known but that can't be it! I haven't cast since I was a mischievous child! Still, I must try... "~
@6 = ~A large book has been discovered in the tower of Karlat Jhareg, one of the two lords of Charwood who currently stand accused by the Guardian Spirit on the castle's main floor. Lighting the nearby candelabra revealed instructions regarding the summoning of the demon Belial, Lord of Fire. A demon's influence in these events seems suspicious and well worth investigating, though a re-summoning is no doubt risky business.~
