@0 = ~NP: Hello to you,<MALEFEMALE> . You don't look like all those Neverwinter soldiers that are all over the place, and you don't show any signs of contact with the epidemic either. But you have certain signs that distinguish you from an ordinary city dweller. Based on my observations, I would like to hypothesize that you are an adventurer, right?~ [BODDIN51] /*But you have a certain bearing about you that distinguishes you from the ordinary citizen. Based on my observations I'd venture the hypothesis that you are an adventurer, correct?*/
@1 = ~You're right, I am an adventurer. My name is <CHARNAME>. Who are you?~
@2 = ~NP: Now I don't have time to talk. Goodbye.~ /*I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.*/
@3 = ~I am Boddyknock Glinckle, a gnome sorcerer from the island of Lantan who has only recently arrived here in Neverwinter.~
@4 = ~Lantan? Isn't that the place where all those crazy inventions come from?~
@5 = ~A sorcerer? I thought Lantan looked down on magic.~
@6 = ~What are you doing in Neverwinter?~
@7 = ~Then there's no logical reason to continue this conversation, is there? But if you find yourself in need of a good sorcerer come speak to me again.~
@8 = ~NP: My homeland has a reputation for producing amazing machines and ingenious contraptions unparalleled in Faerûn. We Lantanans are a people guided by the analytical principles of science: observation, common sense, and logic. But do not give in to rumors and tales. We are not crazy inventors, as you might think. For example, I am a wizard.~ /*We Lantanese are a people guided by the analytical principles of science: observation, reason and logic. But don't allow yourself to be misled by rumors and hearsay.*/
@9 = ~I'm looking for a good mercenary to help me in my mission.~
@10 = ~As a practitioner of arcane magic yourself you must surely have encountered the suspicion and fear with which most common folk regard our art. My homeland is not so different.~
@11 = ~NP: The Lantanean people do not despise magic, although many do not understand it. However, in my country, we rely on arcane magic much less than the other peoples of Faerûn. Instead of magic, we prefer to find a scientific solution to a problem. Often, as a result of examination and study of the problem, it can be solved without resorting to magical powers.~ /*We prefer to seek a scientific solution to a problem rather than a magical one. Often through observation and experimentation a problem can be solved without resorting to mage-craft.*/
@12 = ~Of course, sometimes a little touch of the arcane is a good thing. When the situation is appropriate I do not hesitate to use my powers, <CHARNAME>. I may be from Lantan, but I am first and foremost a sorcerer.~
@13 = ~Your mission? And what mission would that be, exactly?~
@14 = ~NP: I work for Aribeth. I've been tasked with finding the missing creatures that will serve as ingredients for a cure for the plague.~ /*I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that are ingredients for a plague cure.*/
@15 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@16 = ~NP: I left my home some time ago to explore the outside world. It is common for the inhabitants of my island to undertake such journeys. I was exploring the northern part of the Sword Coast when I heard the echoes of rumors of a previously unknown epidemic spreading across Neverwinter. In the name of scientific research, I have come to investigate and describe this new disease.~ /*I was exploring the northern Sword Coast when I heard rumblings of a previously unknown plague breaking out in Neverwinter. In the name of scientific discovery I came to investigate and catalog the new illness.*/
@17 = ~NP: A secret mission from Lady Aribeth? Under the current circumstances, it is not difficult for me to assume that your task is somehow connected with the search for a cure for the epidemic. Since I have my own scientific interest in the plague, I would be very happy to keep you company and help complete the task,<CHARNAME> .~ /*A confidential mission from Lady Aribeth? Given the circumstances it is not difficult for me to surmise that your mission is somehow connected to finding a cure for the plague.*/
@18 = ~NP: Yes, I believe that isolating a cure from certain reagents may be a viable method of preventing the rapid spread of an epidemic. Since I have my own scientific interest in the plague, I would be very happy to keep you company and help complete the task,<CHARNAME> .~ /*Yes, I suppose extracting a cure from certain reagents could be a possible method of countering the rapid spread of this epidemic.*/
@19 = ~Fortunately I arrived before the city was quarantined. I decided to begin my investigations of the Wailing Death in the Beggar's Nest.~
@20 = ~Why the Beggar's Nest?~
@21 = ~NP: From the evidence I have collected, it can be concluded that the Beggars' Nest was the place where the disease originated. I believe that the best way to study the plague is to reconstruct the chain of stages of its development from the original source. And when I realized that the clerics were unable to overcome the plague, I thought that I could apply the scientific principles of Lantana to obtain a more mundane cure.~ /*From the accounts I gathered, it was generally agreed that the Beggar's Nest was where the outbreak began. I thought the best way to learn about the plague was to trace it back to its source.*/
@22 = ~Unfortunately I had to end my investigations into the Beggar's Nest mere days after they began. Far too short a time to conduct a proper study of the situation.~
@23 = ~Why did you stop your investigations?~
@24 = ~NP: Everything points to the fact that you<MALEFEMALE> not without ability, and not afraid of a little adventure and exploration. I will join you for 750 gold.~ /*All evidence seems to indicate you are a capable <PRO_MANWOMAN> who isn't afraid of a little adventure and exploration.*/
@25 = ~I could use a good sorcerer. Here's your 250 gold. Welcome aboard, Boddyknock.~
@26 = ~How about 150 and the promise you'll experience wonders you've never seen before?~
@27 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@28 = ~Goodbye.~
@29 = ~NP: It's pretty hard to do serious scientific analysis when you're constantly being harassed by zombies. Even though I want to continue my research, I wouldn't want to lay down my life for it just yet. However, the zombie invasion is more than just a coincidence to me. I suspect that there is more than a casual connection between the animated corpses on the streets and the outbreak of the plague.~ /*It is difficult to conduct a serious scientific analysis when you are constantly beseiged by zombies. Much as I wanted to continue my research, I was not about to throw my life away to do it.*/
@30 = ~While the zombies continue to wander the district I cannot test my theory, but I suspect information that could lead to a cure can be found within the Beggar's Nest.~
@31 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some hired help to assist me on my mission.~
@32 = ~I'll be going now. Goodbye.~
@33 = ~NP: Every expedition needs a leader. Since you are paying, of course, it makes sense that you should be in charge. I will use my spells and skills to help you to the best of my ability.~ /*Every expedition needs a leader. Since you're paying it's only logical that you should be the one in charge.*/
@34 = ~NP: There was something said about a new experience. Okay, I agree with your proposal. 600 gold, and deal. I will use my spells and skills to help you to the best of my ability.~ /*There is something to be said for new experiences. Okay, I agree to your terms. 200 gold it is.*/
@35 = ~You're not the only one looking to hire me. It wouldn't be logical for me to cut my rate with demand exceeding supply. My offer stands at 250.~
@36 = ~If you can't afford a henchmen, why are you speaking with me? That doesn't make sense, does it? Come on back if you come up with the gold to hire me.~
@37 = ~NP: Are you here again? This makes me conclude that you need my help. How can I be of service to you?~ [BODDIN52] /*You are back, <CHARNAME>. That would lead me to conclude that you require some assistance from me. How can I be of service to you?*/
@38 = ~Who are you again?~
@39 = ~I want to ask you some questions about Neverwinter.~
@40 = ~NP: My knowledge of the city is rather limited as I have not been here for very long. My arrival exactly coincided with the closing of the gates of the city for quarantine. I have come in the name of scientific curiosity to record and study this new epidemic that has struck the North. I concluded that the most logical place to start my research on the Howling Death would be the Beggar's Nest.~ /*My knowledge of the city is somewhat limited, as I have not been here very long. My arrival coincided precisely with the closing of the gates and quarantine of the city.*/
@41 = ~NP: Good to see you again<CHARNAME> , although, in fact, I can not say that I was surprised. When I heard that Aribeth was recruiting people to help find the cult behind the Howling Death, the only logical assumption was that you would be among the volunteers.~ [BODDIN53] /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be one of those recruited.*/
@42 = ~What are you doing here, Boddyknock?~
@43 = ~You again? Are you following me? I've never been stalked by a gnome before.~
@44 = ~NP: I was going to continue my exploration of the North. But then I heard that Aribeth was recruiting mercenaries to find the cult that was causing the plague. You can get the cure for the plague and punish those behind it<CHARNAME> , but the process by which the Howling Death spread has not yet been determined.~ /*You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.*/
@45 = ~NP: I *don't* watch you<CHARNAME> ! I simply have a legitimate scientific interest in investigating the causes of the Howling Death and the events that took place in Neverwinter. You can get the cure for the plague and punish those behind it<CHARNAME> , but the process by which the Howling Death spread has not yet been determined.~ /*You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.*/
@46 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. If you find yourself in need of a sorcerer you know where to find me... until someone else hires my services.~
@47 = ~Given my scientific interest in this plague, and my desire to ensure it is never again unleashed upon Faerun, it was only logical that I answer Aribeth's call for aid.~
@48 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@49 = ~NP: How much will it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@50 = ~NP: When Aribeth called in the mercenaries, we were all paid up front for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher does not save on measures to eradicate these sectarians. We were told to simply help anyone who needs it. So, with that in mind, is there anything I can do for you?~ /*When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.*/
@51 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@52 = ~NP: I have heard people blaming everything on a cult that has spread in the plains to the south, others insist that there is incontrovertible evidence of a cult in the forests to the east, and still others swear that this sect is hiding in Luskan, in the north. Probably, all these rumors and gossip should not be trusted. I prefer to trust solid, hard evidence - evidence that I can observe with my own eyes. And so far I haven't found a single piece of evidence that can be trusted.~ /*Obviously such rumors and hearsay are of little value. I prefer to put my faith in hard, empirical evidence - evidence I can observe with my own two eyes. As yet, I have found no evidence I consider reliable.*/
@53 = ~But you must have an opinion of where to start looking.~
@54 = ~NP: I don't think you understand me. Without the necessary data for analysis, my assessment of the situation will be just a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin for error. Basically, I've built a few tentative theories, but if I have to give any opinion on this, it's just an absolute guess.~ /*Naturally I have formed some preliminary theories, but if I were to venture any opinion on this matter it would be nothing more than a complete and utter guess.*/
@55 = ~So guess, Boddyknock. Sometimes you've just got to play a hunch.~
@56 = ~NP: Uh ... suddenly, that is, intuitively? Well what are you<MALEFEMALE> ,<CHARNAME> even strange. I believe that if we were forced to make... a guess, I would say that we should begin our search in Neverwinter Forest, southeast of Port Llast. Roots, herbs and other vegetation are abundant in the forests, and many of the plants can be used to heal various diseases. The only logical assumption is that gathering these herbs can also be used to induce sickness or death.~ /*Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.*/
@57 = ~NP: In addition, the most civilized part of the population avoids forests - they believe that forests are filled with various creatures - which makes the forest an indispensable place for large groups of conspirators to hide. The Forest of Neverwinter is perhaps the only place that provides the privacy and materials the cult needs to summon the Howling Death. At least that's my only guess.~ /*Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group.*/
@58 = ~You seem to have some solid reasons... for a guess.~
@59 = ~So are you going to investigate the woods?~
@60 = ~I could use a sorcerer by my side, Boddyknock.~
@61 = ~As I said, I had a preliminary hypothesis. However, I would not be at all surprised to find my theory about the Neverwinter Wood to be wrong.~
@62 = ~NP: I'm an accomplished sorcerer<CHARNAME> , but I have a realistic idea of the limits of my own abilities. Standing alone against the wilderness in this area can be a test beyond my ability. By the way, Aribeth hired us, so we have the right to serve and help those who are more prone to heroism and great deeds.~ /*I am an accomplished sorcerer, <CHARNAME>, but I also have a realistic understanding of my own limitations. Surviving the wilds of this region alone would be a challenge that surpasses my capabilities.*/
@63 = ~You are a well known hero, <CHARNAME>. If I were to accompany you I am certain my skills would be of some use.~
@64 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@65 = ~NP: In that case, I'll be glad to join your cause,<CHARNAME> . It's an honor to serve a hero like you. I will follow you and do my best in obedience to the order you have given.~ /*Then I will be glad to join your cause, <CHARNAME>. It is an honor to serve with a hero such as you.*/
@66 = ~NP: Nice to see you again<CHARNAME> . It's me, Boddinock Glinkle of Lantan Island. I hope you remember me from our last meeting. When I heard that Aribeth was hiring people to help find the cult behind the Howling Death, it was just one step in a logical chain to assume you would join us.~ [BODDIN55] /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.*/
@67 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@68 = ~NP: When Aribeth called in the mercenaries, we were all paid up front for our services - well paid. You managed to get a cure for the plague, but the process by which the Howling Death spreads has not yet been determined. I long to solve this mystery, if only such horrors can be told to the whole world. But the matter will be brought to an end only when we discover this cult.~ /*I am eager to solve that mystery, if only so such a horror can never be unleashed upon the world yet again. But that can only be accomplished if we first locate the cult.*/
@69 = ~Greetings, good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Forgive me for being so bold, but you are the one known as <CHARNAME>, aren't you?~ [BODDIN54]
@70 = ~Yes, I am <CHARNAME>. How did you know?~
@71 = ~No, I think you have me confused with someone else.~
@72 = ~My hypothesis was based upon your manner of dress and physical appearance combined with the descriptions I have heard from those praising the <PRO_MANWOMAN> responsible for saving Neverwinter from the Wailing Death.~
@73 = ~NP: Well, this is not only my merit. Aribeth and the other city guards did no less.~ /*Well, I wasn't acting alone. Aribeth and the other city guard did as much as I.*/
@74 = ~Everybody recognizes me now. I guess that's the price I pay for being a living legend.~
@75 = ~Ah, forgive me then. I will have to go back and reevaluate the data I was basing my assumption on.~
@76 = ~Your modesty is admirable, but the facts cannot be denied. Others may have been involved, but everyone is in agreement that you played a particularly crucial role.~
@77 = ~Now I understand why they praise your abilities, and not your modesty.~
@78 = ~NP: I am Boddinock Glinkle, a dwarf sorcerer from the Isle of Lantan. I must confess I'm not surprised to see you here<CHARNAME> . When I heard that Aribeth was hiring people to help find the cult behind the Howling Death, it was just one step in the logic chain to assume you would join us.~ /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.*/
@79 = ~NP: I came to Neverwinter to study the plague - its causes and effects - in order to avoid a similar catastrophe in the future. You have managed to obtain a cure for the plague, but the process by which the Howling Death spreads has not yet been determined. I long to solve this mystery, if only such horrors can be told to the whole world. But the matter will be brought to an end only when we discover this cult.~ /*I am eager to solve that mystery, if only so such a horror can never be unleashed upon the world yet again. But that can only be accomplished if we first locate the cult.*/
