@0    = ~Who's there? I didn't invite anyone... Ah... your face is new to me. Who are you, good <PRO_LADYLORD>?~
@1    = ~I'm <CHARNAME> and I'm pleased to meet you. I was wandering around and... well, I decided I wanted to see who lives in this house. But now that I think about it, people don't normally do things like that around here...~
@2    = ~I'm new to this village. My name is <CHARNAME>. Where I come from, it's a tradition to visit every house in the village and say 'hello'. So... hello!~
@3    = ~Shut up, old hag!~
@4    = ~Oh, never mind! Despite entering my home uninvited, I think you must be a kind child.~
@5    = ~(The old lady laughs gently.) Hello to you, too! Well, that's an interesting tradition, and I must say that I find it quite agreeable, child.~
@6    = ~My eyes are not so keen as they were ten years ago, and they were not so keen even then. I haven't spoken to anyone for a week. Should I even refer to you as a child? How old are you?~
@7    = ~I'm one and twenty, ma'am.~
@8    = ~I'm not a child. I'm a grown <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@9    = ~I like it when you call me that, ma'am, so let's say I'm still a child. To be honest, it's not far from the truth, but... ah, it doesn't matter.~
@10   = ~Oh, just shut up!~
@11   = ~Oh, dear, you're a grown <PRO_MANWOMAN>. (She smiles.) I'm sorry, just... you probably understand... Old people are different from youngsters. My eyes are not so sharp as they once were, but I'm glad I didn't pass away long ago, sharp eyes or no.~
@12   = ~Oh, I understand. I'm sorry if I offended you. Well, now that I've had a good look at you, I see that you are indeed no child.~
@13   = ~Oh, how sweet of you, child! By your voice, I hear that you're not so young as I thought, still you were very forgiving with this old woman when I referred to you as a child. Thank you.~
@14   = ~It doesn't matter how old you are. I'm so glad that somebody has come in to visit with me. I'm much older than the other people in the village; they have their lives, children, lovers... They don't have time for someone like me. Don't think I blame them; I don't! I'm glad they have their families and lives.~
@15   = ~Oh, but where are my manners? My name is Barbara, but most of the villagers call me 'Granny Barbara' or 'Granny Bunny'.~
@16   = ~(When your eyes become accustomed to the dim lighting in the house, you can see Barbara's face. She has wrinkles around her eyes and mouth, dry skin, small smiling lips and warm, brown eyes, all of which exude kindness.)~
@17   = ~Is something wrong, <CHARNAME>?~
@18   = ~Absolutely not! I was just... thinking! I'm very pleased to meet you, Granny!~
@19   = ~You are such a bore! I'm not surprised that hardly anyone ever visits you, old hag!~
@20   = ~Everything's all right, Barbara.~
@21   = ~May I ask why you came to Innershade? Old people like me are full of curiosity! (Her eyes brighten as she anticipates your reply.)~
@22   = ~I've just recently heard about Innershade, and it sounded so interesting that I decided to come and see it for myself.  I particularly enjoy small villages.~
@23   = ~To be honest, I don't know. I think it's something like coincidence that I found out about this place.~
@24   = ~I thought I might find some work, or quests, in this place. I'm an adventurer.~
@25   = ~I hope I'll find treasure, or some old and forgotten artifact.~
@26   = ~I came here because I like to meet new people.~
@27   = ~It's none of your business,  you old, smelly myconid.~
@28   = ~Oh, I know what you mean, <CHARNAME>. When I was young like you, I also enjoyed visiting places such as this. I loved hearing new tales and seeing new faces... Oh, I miss those times! But being elderly isn't such a bad thing...~
@29   = ~Perhaps I'm not so strong and quick as I was in the past, but now I have plenty of leisure time. If I really need help, I know that the children of Innershade will assist me. However, I like to try doing everything I can on my own. I don't want to trouble those smiling little children. I prefer to let them play together and have the type of fun only children can have.~
@30   = ~Oh, life is one big coincidence, don't you think? Oh, but that's why I'm glad that I can still live and breathe and enjoy life. I adore surprises, and you are one of them! It's like chocolate candy: you never know what you'll find inside! A cherry, strawberry or...even whiskey! (She smiles and winks at you.)~
@31   = ~Do you think I had any idea that someone like you would visit my home? Never, and here you are... a nice surprise!~
@32   = ~An adventurer? You're so young, and you're out and fighting so soon?~
@33   = ~Well, I don't know why I asked. I was the same! I was an adventurer for a time, but later I realized it wasn't for me... still, that's how I met my husband, so I don't regret it. But now he's dead, and I live here alone. Such is life: the elderly die, children are born, and yet it would be boring if it was any different!~
@34   = ~In Innershade? Well, I don't think so, child, but I may be mistaken. If you're looking for high quality armor, talk with Eva at her house. Perhaps she'll have a magical sword or some such item... I don't know. I'm too old for such things, so I've never asked her.~
@35   = ~The only thing I ever asked of her was to help me with a broken pan, and she did so immediately! That girl has always been so kind to me!~
@36   = ~Ah, so you have the soul of a wanderer! Maybe in the future you'll write a book, or simply tell your children about the places you've visited. Because of your adventures, you'll have become a wiser person. You'll know much about this world.~
@37   = ~Perhaps because of you, someone will hear about Innershade. Hehe, it doesn't matter. We like our village just the way it is. I hope you'll like it, too.~
@38   = ~Please pardon me, but I'm very tired right now, and I still need to have something to eat. Will you visit me in the future?~
@39   = ~Of course, Granny!~
@40   = ~Yes.~
@41   = ~No. I hope you will be dead soon, old hag.~
@42   = ~Sorry, but no. I have other things to do. The children of Innershade will surely visit you, Barbara.~
@43   = ~How kind of you! We will talk again, then! I will prepare tea for us next time!~
@44   = ~I understand. Be careful on the road, <CHARNAME>!~
@45   = ~I thought that you were different. Get out of my house, you brat! You need to learn some manners!~
@46   = ~Ah, it's you again! Come in, come in! No need to be shy. I promised you tea. I'll make a pot of hot raspberry tea with mint leaves! These woods are cold, sometimes, but my tea will warm you.~
@47   = ~Thank you, Barbara. You're very kind.~
@48   = ~No, thank you. I don't care for tea. If you have some water, that would be good.~
@49   = ~Oh, drat... It's this house. I can't stand you, old, hag. I'm leaving at once!~
@50   = ~My pleasure, my pleasure! (Granny takes a small kettle sitting on glowing embers. Periodically, a single spark shoots into the air. Soon, you smell the sweet aroma of the tea filling the house. Granny Bunny returns with a clay mug, hotly and sweetly steaming.)~
@51   = ~Here you go. Warm your hands and body, child. I hope you won't catch cold. This tea should help.~
@52   = ~Just cold water? Well, if you wish, child. Ah, probably you've been rushing about and you want something colder than tea. Wait a moment, and I'll bring you a mug of water from our well. (A few moments later, Granny slowly returns to the small table, with a pot filled with a translucent liquid, and pours some into the clay mug.)~
@53   = ~Here, child. I'm glad that an old woman like me is able to help someone. If you want some more water, just tell me.~
@54   = ~Now, <CHARNAME>, why did you came back? Are you looking for something, child, or are you just wandering to pass the time?~
@55   = ~Well, I wanted to make sure everything is all right with you, Barbara. So, how are you?~
@56   = ~You promised me tea! I had to come!~
@57   = ~What do you mean by "this place"? Innershade, or your house?~
@58   = ~I wanted to see if there's more work for me in this village.~
@59   = ~It's none of your business, old hag, so shut up.~
@60   = ~Oh, that's so kind of you! I didn't expect such kindness from a person I barely know, and... well, I'm not young anymore. Not many want to spend their time with old people.~
@61   = ~I feel the same as always, <CHARNAME>. But thank you for asking. I wish I could thank you better, but I don't know how. I don't have any money...~
@62   = ~But I don't want anything. I just wanted to make sure that everything is all right with you, Granny.~
@63   = ~Well, that's no help! I've had enough of your... bah! I don't even know what to call it! Leave me.~
@64   = ~(Granny starts to laugh.) I really like that answer! Oh, I haven't laughed for such a long time! You really know how to make me feel alive, <CHARNAME>. Sometimes old people become bored and tired of such a lonely life.~
@65   = ~So, thank you, my child. You're very kind. I don't know how else to thank you.~
@66   = ~I just wanted to know if everything was all right with you. I need no thanks for that.~
@67   = ~Whatever. I've had enough of this pretentious situation. It's... a distraction. Leave me, old hag.~
@68   = ~I mean Innershade, my child.~
@69   = ~Well, you promised me tea! You thought that I would forget, aye? (Smile.)~
@70   = ~I wanted to see if you are all right, Granny Bunny.~
@71   = ~I think it's not your business, hag.~
@72   = ~Ah, I understand. I hope you'll find some work here.~
@73   = ~It may be silly of me, but... well, I'm an old person, and I may be eccentric... Why have you decided to visit me?~
@74   = ~Because you promised me tea! You thought that I would forget that? Ha! Of course I wouldn't forget, Granny!~
@75   = ~I just wanted to check and see if my favorite villager is all right.~
@76   = ~I just asked myself the same question, hag. I won't visit you any more.~
@77   = ~I wish I had a child or grandchild like you, <CHARNAME>... I'll think of some way I can properly thank you. I'd like to give you something, yet I don't have anything that could be of use to you...~
@78   = ~Ah, I have to say my prayers now. If you want to remain in my house for a while, feel free to do so, child.~
@79   = ~You impolite brat... I don't wish to talk with you anymore. Please, leave my home.~
@80   = ~Ah, my eyes see <CHARNAME> again! Come in, child, come in. You came just in time: I've just made a plate of delicious butter biscuits with chipped chocolate, honey, and cinnamon. It's good to have a snack like this on a cold and shady <DAYNIGHT>. We have a plenty of those here in Innershade. So, my <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>? Would you like to have one?~
@81   = ~Well, of course I want to have one! Maybe even two, three, or ten! I know they're delicious just by smelling the wonderful aroma in your home!~
@82   = ~Sorry, but I'm on a diet, Barbara. You see, adventurers fight a lot! I need to work out, build some nice muscles, and watch what I eat. Surely you understand that I need to make a good impression on the people I meet.~
@83   = ~Shut up, old hag. The way you speak is really annoying. And by the way, don't call me "<PRO_SONDAUGHTER>". I'm no child of yours.~
@84   = ~(Barbara smiles gently.) Oh, stop flattering me, child. Save those compliments for people as young as you are! By Tymora, you are a charmer! Here, take some more biscuits, in case you get hungry during your march! They'll help keep your energy up. You know, you should eat five meals a day, since you need a lot of energy to adventure. But first, tell me if you like them.~
@85   = ~(Granny Bunny gives you a plate with a dozen  still-warm biscuits. You take one and quickly pop the lightly steaming morsel into your mouth. It's very sweet, the honey combined with cinnamon and chocolate creating an unforgettable flavor. Tiny pieces of chocolate melt in your mouth. The biscuits are pleasantly crunchy. While you enjoy the snack, Granny puts the rest of the biscuits into a small woolen bag and conceals it in your pack.)~
@86   = ~Oh, really? Well, I think you look quite well! You're not too plump, nor too skinny. However, maybe you don't care for honey or cinnamon. Of course, I won't pressure you to eat anything, my child. But you know, I'll give you some for a time when you're really hungry, or would like to give one to someone close to your heart. Maybe one of your companions will become hungry. Here, take some.~
@87   = ~(Granny Bunny takes some of the biscuits from the plate, places them on a piece of material, and ties all four corners together with a ribbon. Next, she approaches your bag and conceals the little bundle in your pack.)~
@88   = ~I placed them in such a way as to prevent the biscuits from crushing. Well, cutie, I don't want you to have your wand or sword covered in chocolate and honey! Now I'll be sure you won't wander with an empty stomach. I've seen many hungry children looking for anything edible. Poor children. It's a pity I'm no longer young and able to help such people more.~
@89   = ~But never mind. Let us not talk about sad things. So, has anything special happened since your last visit, my child? I hope you didn't get hurt.~
@90   = ~Nothing unusual. I met some people, had a fight with some creatures, spoke with an interesting man and woman. Just the usual things in an adventurer's life.~
@91   = ~The usual stuff, Granny. You know, I'd rather not talk about my chaotic life when I'm with you. I see you and your home as a kind of refuge. I'm glad I can relax here and talk with such a nice person. Yes, Barbara! I'm speaking of you! (Smile.)~
@92   = ~I killed some bandits, got a scar here and there, but hey, that's how adventurers live!~
@93   = ~Eh, I can no longer stand your babbling, hag. You know, it's a wonder you're still alive. You're a bit like a cockroach, all dry and ugly.~
@94   = ~Oh, it's a dangerous life, but for you young people it's also something called fun. Well, I won't tell you to be like older people, and I won't say it's foolish to risk your life and that you should accept only simple tasks. Youth is called youth because of its risky nature and having fun.~
@95   = ~Oh, how sweet of you, my child. I'm glad, and you should know that you're always welcome in my home! I'll admit I feared that you'd be bored by an old lady's stories! Very well, if you don't want to talk about your adventures, I won't pressure you, cutie.~
@96   = ~Are you interested in hearing a tale from when I was young?~
@97   = ~Yes, please.~
@98   = ~Of course! I'd love to!~
@99   = ~No. Sorry, but it's time for me to go.~
@100  = ~Not right now, but  I would like a biscuit. May I...?~
@101  = ~No, old hag. Shut up.~
@102  = ~Marvelous. You see, I was once an adventurer, too. I traveled through the Sword Coast, I visited Baldur's Gate, Waterdeep... I even decided to take a look at the streets of Neverwinter, Luskan, and Athkatla. In Baldur's Gate, I met a nice boy: Entar. What a cute teenager he was back then.~
@103  = ~I worked for a while as a guardian of the small village of Beregost. I was known for my agility and tracking skills. I had my favorite longbow that I called "Lucky Shot", but during one of my battles, an ogre smashed it. Then, I tried to train myself with a longsword, but after some time, I decided that I was more comfortable with ranged weapons.~
@104  = ~I also remember my visit in the calm citadel of Candlekeep. I met many monks, librarians and wizards there. Once, I met a young man called Gorion. Ah, what a brat he was! He was studying magic. He visited Candlekeep for a day or two, and half the time we spent together was relaxing in a tavern! Ah, such memories! I wish I had one more chance to adventure, but I'm too old now.~
@105  = ~You must be joking...Gorion was a brat? Hehe! Gorion was my foster father, and I grew up in Candlekeep. I also met Entar Silvershield. It seems that we visited the same places, Granny.~
@106  = ~Hmm...I have to go. Bye!~
@107  = ~Yeah, right, but now shut your mouth, hag.~
@108  = ~Unbelievable! Oh, now I see why I like you so much, child. Thank you for listening to my reminiscing.~
@109  = ~I see. Good <DAYNIGHT> to you then! Be careful on the road!~
@110  = ~Of course you can! Now I need some rest, but stay as long as you wish to, cutie.~
@111  = ~I thought that you were cultured, and that you had good manners, but now I see I was wrong. Leave my house! I dn't wish to talk with you anymore.~
@112  = ~(You see Barbara staring at something through the window. She is clearly elsewhere with her thoughts. Suddenly, she realizes that you're observing her, and she smiles.) Hello, my child. I'm so glad that you still visit me from time to time. Thank you. I'm sorry for being so distracted. I had a strange dream last night.~
@113  = ~What did you dream about, Granny? I'd like to hear it.~
@114  = ~A kind of nightmare, aye? Hey, just tell me the dream and you'll feel better.~
@115  = ~Oh, great... Now you'll bother me with your dreams... I don't understand why I even visit you!~
@116  = ~I wouldn't call it a nightmare, my <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>...~
@117  = ~It all began in the sky, above some strange world. I was among the clouds, falling, but without any fear. The wind was dancing wildly all around. The clouds were like wool, and I tried to catch them, but I couldn't. The ground was coming closer and closer, but still I wasn't afraid. I was waiting, and to be honest, it was...a sort of anticipation.~
@118  = ~Then I landed, but the ground I hit shattered into a thousand shards... just like a glass that hits a marble floor. I was still falling, but this time through complete darkness. Down, beneath my feet, sparkles appeared: green, violet, golden, silver and many other colors. The distance shortened with every second. Then I realized something: the lights I saw weren't sparkles, but lanterns on the street of a tiny village. However, everything was so distant that I couldn't identify the place.~
@119  = ~This strange land was now within reach. I didn't hit the ground, and I didn't die then. I landed easily on my feet. But the moment I touched the ground, all the shapes around me turned into liquid: all the buildings, lights and rocks blended into one lake of different shades. I don't know how to describe it any other way. Then I heard a voice.~
@120  = ~'Take the brush and paint your own world,' it said. Then I woke up. It was a very strange experience, but still very beautiful. I don't understand the meaning behind those words, but I don't think it matters. I think I've already painted a world of my own, and that world is Innershade, my home. Because of this place, I still live and smile every day. I think you're a part of this place, too, my child. That's because you make me smile and remember my own youth.~
@121  = ~I think that was a beautiful dream. You know, I think I've seen this place, too. It's called The Deep Gardens. I was forced to travel through it and find a way back. Those lights, buildings, and the entire village surrounded by darkness... everything was as you described it.~
@122  = ~I think you're a wonderful person, and you make people smile. You're a cheerful elderly woman, Granny Bunny. I wish you were my blood grandmother.~
@123  = ~Thank you for sharing those beautiful images with me, Barbara. You should be a bard. That description of yours was so vivid and colorful! I wish I had those kinds of dreams.~
@124  = ~Are you finished? At last! I thought this story would never end!~
@125  = ~I see... However, I don' understand why I dreamed about this. Maybe because I always wished to find a place like that. You're lucky because you were able to wander through that place. I hope I'll be able to visit it again one night.~
@126  = ~I have no family other than the villagers of Innershade, but your words warm my heart, my child. You would be a wonderful grandchild to me, <CHARNAME>. I can do nothing but thank you.~
@127  = ~Oh, stop that! Old people blush, too, from time to time! Hoho, you know how to give pretty compliments, but give them to someone closer to your own age! Perhaps they'll bring you some love! Oh, I know what you young people think about!~
@128  = ~You'll see more lands, more skies and more people in your life. All I have now are dreams. Those are the only adventures I can have, but they're enough for me. However, I'd like to hear something about your plans. Do you intend to visit some distant places, <CHARNAME>?~
@129  = ~I'd like to, but I currently have a few things that are unfinished. I have to fight for the sake of my friend, Imoen, and for myself, with a man called Irenicus. He's planning something terrible, and I must stop him.~
@130  = ~I'm sure one day I'll visit places like Rashemen. I've met two Rashemi: Minsc and Dynaheir. I'd like to meet more of them.~
@131  = ~I've met some Red Wizards. Edwin, my companion, is a Red Wizard. I must know if all of them are as annoying as he is, so I'll probably visit Thay.~
@132  = ~Sure. Perhaps Myth Drannor, Dekapolis, Luskan... We'll see where life throws me!~
@133  = ~It's none of your business. Leave me be, hag.~
@134  = ~I see and understand. I know you'll reach your goal, <CHARNAME>. I have no doubt that you'll prevail against this... Irena, or whatever his or her name is.~
@135  = ~Oh, what a cold place! Perhaps I'm mistaken, but I recall reading about Rashemen, and the climate there is extremely harsh. You've met Rashemi... they must be fascinating people!~
@136  = ~Oh, yes they are! I've also met a few Red Wizards. I didn't have to fight with them, but they're insolent and egocentric people! It's probably a common feature of Red Wizards.~
@137  = ~Ah, so you don't know yet. Well, that's good. You'll be nicely surprised, then, when you end up visiting breathtaking, majestic mountains, or deep and mysterious dungeons.~
@138  = ~I'm glad that we had another chance to have a chat. Thank you for listening to my dreams, and for this conversation about adventuring. Visit me again if you have the time, cutie. Take care! (Barbara gives you a warm smile.)~
@139  = ~You're much more insolent than I thought! Leave me. I don't wish to talk with you.~
@140  = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. I'm sorry I didn't make any biscuits or bring you some berries, but I don't feel well. You see, I'm ill. The witch-doctor is visiting me from time to time, but he doesn't know how to help me. Please, if you want to make yourself a mug of hot tea, go ahead. Make yourself at home, my child. (Barbara coughs. Her skin looks pale, and she looks weak and tired.)~
@141  = ~Thank you. (Make two mugs of tea with a spoonful of blueberry jam, one for you and one for Granny Bunny.)~
@142  = ~You are ill? So, I have to go, then. I don't want to get sick. Bye!~
@143  = ~I didn't come here for tea. How do you feel, Barbara?~
@144  = ~(You make tea. After a few minutes, it's ready. You hand one of the mugs to Barbara, and she smiles at you.) That's so kind of you. Thank you, cutie. Maybe some tea will warm me a bit.~
@145  = ~You see, I feel a bit... down with an illness. I have a temperature, and my back pains me. Well, I'm an old woman, but believe me, I'll feel better soon. You don't need to worry or fuss. I'm sure the witch-doctor will give me some herbs or potions that will make me feel better.~
@146  = ~I hope that I won't catch this thing.~
@147  = ~Don't worry, Granny, we adventurers are always hale and hearty! Well, eating so many apples and drinking the odd mug of ale now and then probably helps!~
@148  = ~Even if yes, it's not a big deal. Since I'm still young, I'd feel better within a day. I'm worried about you, Granny.~
@149  = ~Well, I'll leave, then. I don't want to get sick.~
@150  = ~(Granny laughs gently, then suddenly begins coughing.) Oh, this cough will finish me. It really annoys me and causes my back and ribs to hurt!~
@151  = ~Oh, don't worry about it. I'm sure I'll feel better soon, and then I'll make more biscuits and tea for you.~
@152  = ~I'm sorry, but I'd like to sleep a bit. Stay here in my house if you wish. As I've said before, you're always welcome here. I'm sorry that I'm not very good company today.~
@153  = ~(Barbara smiles at you, but says no more.)~
@154  = ~I see. Goodbye then, <CHARNAME>.~
@155  = ~So, that child managed to find you, my <PRO_SONDAUGHTER>. I'm glad I can see you before I die. It's certain that these are my last moments. I asked that child to look for you because I really enjoyed all our visits, <CHARNAME>.~
@156  = ~Barbara, you'll survive this. I know it. You must.~
@157  = ~Oh, right. Just die and leave me be. It's the best thing you can do.~
@158  = ~(Smile at Granny Bunny and take her hand.)~
@159  = ~I've lived long enough. It will be better for me to pass away. It's not easy to be elderly. Well, it's nice to tell youngsters what they should do, sometimes! (She coughs.) Well, I'm joking of course...~
@160  = ~Thank you for not ignoring the child, and for coming here. I was a bit lonely here in Innershade before I met you. I've enjoyed our time together; I was happy to make biscuits for you, and to sip tea while talking about the past.~
@161  = ~You know, it's fine with me that I have to leave Innershade and Faerun now. Perhaps I'll be able to visit the places I've seen in my dreams, or lands even more colorful and mysterious. You understand, I'm sure. It would be pointless to live for eternity. I was an adventurer, and I was a Granny for you and the children of Innershade.~
@162  = ~But enough of this talk. I'd like to give you something, my child.~
@163  = ~(Barbara struggles to a sitting position on the bed, and takes a small chest from the tiny table beside the bed. It's made of dark wood with iron reinforcements, and in the centre is a shiny keyhole. Suddenly, a key appears in Barbara's wrinkled hand. She inserts it into the lock and turns it. She unlocks and opens the chest. A small ruby rests inside.)~
@164  = ~Please, take this stone. I found it long ago when I was still an adventurer. It saved my life many times. Now, I'd like it to serve you as it served me so long ago. But it cannot help me anymore. (She smiles and lies back down on the bed, her skin even more pale than before.)~
@165  = ~Beautiful, isn't it?~
