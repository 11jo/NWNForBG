@0 = ~Identify yourself, <PRO_SIRMAAM>! Blacklake is off-limits to all but district residents and the city guard!~
@1 = ~I made it past the gate, didn't I?~
@2 = ~Watch your tone. I've had enough of being challenged.~
@3 = ~I am a member of the guard, working for Aribeth.~
@4 = ~MT: Well, yes... I think it's true. Besides, you work for Lady Aribeth, don't you? I'm sorry,<LADYLORD> . You know, people are desperate and everything, so you have to be careful. Just in case, I'll tell the other patrolmen about you.~ /*My apologies, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Can't be too careful with folks getting desperate and all. I'll tell the other patrolmen about you, to be sure.*/
@5 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@6 = ~Goodbye.~
@7 = ~Who says you passed the gate? Not I. Now, <PRO_SIRMAAM>, I have strict orders regarding intruders in the district.~
@8 = ~MT: Er... yes,<LADYLORD> . I think I recognize you now. You're one of those who work for Aribeth de Tilmarand, aren't you? I'm sorry,<LADYLORD> . You know, people are desperate and everything, so you have to be careful. Just in case, I'll tell the other patrolmen about you.~ /*My apologies, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Can't be too careful with folks getting desperate and all. I'll tell the other patrolmen about you, to be sure.*/
@9 = ~MT: And that's the least of my concerns.<SIRMAAM> . Sea in the city!~ /*I'm not interested anymore.*/
@10 = ~MT: Yes, and I don't care what your orders are. I go where I want.~ /*Yeah, and me no care about orders. Me go where me wants.*/
@11 = ~MT: Exactly, now I remember. I'm sorry,<LADYLORD> . You know, people are desperate and everything, so you have to be careful. Just in case, I'll tell the other patrolmen about you.~ /*My apologies, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Can't be too careful with folks getting desperate and all. I'll tell the other patrolmen about you, to be sure.*/
@12 = ~I suppose I can answer a question for you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@13 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@14 = ~Anything interesting going on in Blacklake?~
@15 = ~MT: As you wish,<SIRMAAM> .~ /*As you wish, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.*/
@16 = ~I suppose you have that right, working for the city as you do. I'd be more polite around the established guards, though; you'll need what friends you can get.~
@17 = ~Not much more than anyone else, thankfully. Patrolling here in Blacklake has its advantages, after all.~
@18 = ~What have you heard of the Waterdhavian creatures on the loose?~
@19 = ~Any strange events lately that you can think of?~
@20 = ~Could be, I suppose. What kinds of things you find interesting?~
@21 = ~Anything you consider odd?~
@22 = ~Anyone in need of assistance that you know of?~
@23 = ~Places of interest, perhaps?~
@24 = ~I heard something about some beasts loose in the city... but I haven't seen anything like that here in Blacklake, that's for certain.~
@25 = ~Has there been anything odd since the creatures escaped, that you remember?~
@26 = ~Any idea where they could be if they came here?~
@27 = ~Nothing to do with the plague, no. We haven't been getting much news here since we closed the district off.~
@28 = ~There's been no cases of the plague here at all?~
@29 = ~MT: No more. There was trouble with one woman named Formosa, but things have calmed down. Now there is nothing special going on here. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Not anymore. There was some business with a local woman named Formosa, but that's over with. Nothing much happening here now.*/
@30 = ~MT: Hmm. This Formosa in the southeast square keeps screaming about how much she needs help. If you ask me, I will say that someone should shut her up. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Hmph. That Formosa keeps on going on in the southeast square about how she wants help. Someone should shut her up, you ask me.*/
@31 = ~MT: Well, Meldanen had some unusual guest, but now everything has been resolved. Now there's nothing much going on here. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Well, Meldanen had a visitor about that time, but that matter has been settled. There's not much happening here now.*/
@32 = ~MT: Hmm. You know, that's when Meldanen got this new visitor. A strange woman, and he begged the guards not to tell anyone about her. Even paid us some. And yet I will tell you. This girl is strange, in the spirit of this crazy time ... although, how should I know? Meldanen lives in a mansion in the north of the district, so go there. Would you like to know something else?~ /*Hmm. You know, that's when Meldanen got his new visitor. Some strange woman that he's been real insistent on us guards not talking about. Even paid us some gold.*/
@33 = ~MT: You can try to visit the menagerie in the northeast. I don't know, maybe there is something hidden there. Do you need anything else?~ /*You could try the zoo up in the northeast. Maybe something's hiding there, I don't know.*/
@34 = ~MT: There were a few cases... but we immediately quarantined them. And so, no ... fortunately, no outbreaks. Although it is not known how long this will last. Would you like to know something else?~ /*There's been a couple of incidents... but we've quarantined them right away. But no... no outbreaks, thankfully. No idea how long that'll last, though.*/
@35 = ~MT: I don't know. Maybe a beast? It's in the northeast. And I like The Naked Plank... you should visit the basement there. Heh. Would you like to know something else?~ /*I don't know. Maybe the zoo? That's in the northeast. Me, I like the Board Laid Bare... you should check out the basement. Heh.*/
@36 = ~You there! Identify yourself! How did you find your way into the district, tell me!~
@37 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Is there something you need?~
