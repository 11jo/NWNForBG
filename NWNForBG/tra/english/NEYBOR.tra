@0 = ~I ain't doing nothing, friend. Just sitting on the corner...~
@1 = ~Know why thieves are so thick in this area?~
@2 = ~What's your name?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~MT: I don't know anything about anything... I'm just standing on my corner. You should, uh, be careful with those clothes of yours... Looks expensive... Worth something... Yeah.~ /*You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.*/
@5 = ~MT: I have nothing. No. Just a nameless guy on the corner. Nothing to worry about... You should, uh, be careful with those clothes of yours... Looks expensive... Worth something... Yeah.~ /*You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.*/
@6 = ~You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.~
@7 = ~What? I ain't following nobody... just... uh... strolling. Yeah, that's it.~
@8 = ~I've already warned you about following me.~
@9 = ~You'll stroll into a grave! Why are you following people!~
@10 = ~Do I look like a fool? I could see you casing me.~
@11 = ~What? I never... I mean... aw, I'm sorry. I just gotta get some gold together... I wasn't going to do anything to you.~
@12 = ~What do you need gold for?~
@13 = ~This for the auction at Seedy Tavern?~
@14 = ~You just stroll somewhere else.~
@15 = ~MT: I don't... I mean... Damn it all! So never make money! Look, I don't want problems. I'm just looking for easy prey. You are clearly not one of those, so I'll just go myself.~ /*Look, I don't want any trouble. I was just looking for an easy mark. Obviously that ain't you, so I'll just be going.*/
@16 = ~MT: I don't know, I was just told that the plague cure is up for auction at Sidi's Tavern. Now let me get back to work... I'll never make that much. I bet there won't be enough money even if the whole neighborhood is robbed.~ /*I don't know, I just heard that a plague cure was coming up for auction in the Seedy Tavern. Just let me get back to work...*/
@17 = ~What can you tell me about the auction?~
@18 = ~I don't like stalkers. You'd better start running.~
@19 = ~MT: Do you know about it? Nobody was supposed to know. And yet, everyone knows. Somehow it leaked out, or something like that. I don't know, I was just told that the plague cure is up for auction at Sidi's Tavern. Now let me get back to work... I'll never make that much. I bet there won't be enough money even if the whole neighborhood is robbed.~ /*I don't know, I just heard that a plague cure was coming up for auction in the Seedy Tavern. Just let me get back to work...*/
@20 = ~Oh, no problem. Don't you worry. I'll just be on my way then. Yes, on my way... Nice stuff you got there...~
@21 = ~Who, me? I don't know much about it. It's at the Seedy Tavern. It's funded by Bloodsailors... that means Vengaul is involved somehow.~
@22 = ~What do you know about the Seedy Tavern?~
@23 = ~Tell me about Vengaul and the Bloodsailors.~
@24 = ~MT: Nothing that no one will tell you. It is in the northern part of the center of the district, where the black market is located. A guy like me won't even get inside. They have a bouncer at the entrance who doesn't let anyone in except the Bloody Sailors. Their form is hard to come by. Of course, if I had enough money, maybe she would say something else. I don't know.~ /*A guy like me can't even get in there. They've got a brick wall of a bouncer that won't let anyone in that isn't a Bloodsailor.*/
@25 = ~Well, anyone that stays around here for long hears about Vengaul Bloodsail. He's flashy, and he likes showing off. The bloodsailors are his... pirates, mostly.~
@26 = ~Mostly? What do you mean by that?~
@27 = ~MT: Well, it's a big group. One person cannot rule them all. Vengaul, he's just a circus performer, and he needs organizers. They say his first lieutenant is very angry right now. Kallik is his name... but I won't say anything more... I don't know anything else.~ /*I hear that his first lieutenant is hot under the collar right now. Callik's his name... but I ain't saying anything else... I don't know anything else.*/
