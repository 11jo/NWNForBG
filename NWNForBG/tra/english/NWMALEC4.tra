@0 = ~Who are you? Why are you in my home? I don't want to think my fellow Neverwintans would stoop to banditry.~
@1 = ~I am in service to Aribeth and the city guard.~
@2 = ~I just need to ask a few questions.~
@3 = ~NP: I'm going where I want to go.~ /*I'm looking for work.*/
@4 = ~I will leave.~
@5 = ~Hmph. Outsiders hired to replace our dead. I suppose they expect me to trust you? I'll answer a few questions, but then you should leave.~
@6 = ~I need infomation about Neverwinter.~
@7 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@8 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@9 = ~Goodbye.~
@10 = ~I see no reason to answer. You invaded my home and haven't offered any explanation why. Just get out.~
@11 = ~Well, it appears there is very little I can do to prevent you doing what you wish. Does this mean you intend to rob my home?~
@12 = ~Actually, I'm here about gold.~
@13 = ~Good. I don't need strange people invading my home.~
@14 = ~What is it you want to know? I am sure you would get better answers from your fellow guards. I am a simple citizen.~
@15 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@16 = ~What do you know about the leaders of Neverwinter?~
@17 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@18 = ~Not much. There's very little that I need to know except that it kills my friends and family.~
@19 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@20 = ~Sorry, I really don't get out of the City Core much. Especially now with the plague everywhere. It's just not safe.~
@21 = ~Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.~
@22 = ~Oh, no, I've already contributed all I'm going to. I've about had enough of this. If you've got questions, you had better ask them quick and get out.~
@23 = ~I... I see. And how does this apply to me?~
@24 = ~I'm collecting to fund plague relief. Will you do your duty?~
@25 = ~You give me gold and I leave without killing you!~
@26 = ~Actually, I don't need anything except the answers to some questions.~
@27 = ~I can't say much. I live and work in the City Core. The Blacklake district is beyond my means, and I certainly have no business in the others. I don't bother with the Beggar's Nest, the Docks, or the Peninsula. They were rough enough before the Wailing took hold.~ /*I can't say much. I live and work in the City Core. The Blacklake district is beyond my means, and I certainly have no business in the others.*/
@28 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@29 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@30 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@31 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@32 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula district.~
@33 = ~I don't pay much attention to politics. I follow Lord Nasher as our leader, and Lady Aribeth of the Neverwinter Nine.~
@34 = ~How has Lord Nasher dealt with the plague?~
@35 = ~NP: What was Lady Aribeth doing when the plague came?~ /*Have you seen the Lady Aribeth? Isn't she pretty?*/
@36 = ~NP: All right, I'll talk to you. I hope this won't take too long.~ /*I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.*/
@37 = ~Lord Nasher assures us that all efforts are being made to find a cure. Beyond that... I haven't heard anything.~
@38 = ~With the plague going the way it is, everyone will need that gold eventually, so I might as well keep it. I could get it like everyone else.~
@39 = ~NP: Well, I can't give much, but if I give something, maybe others will help too. Who knows, maybe I'll get sick too, and then I'll get it all back. All right, well, can you give me a piece of paper with a stamp to prove that a donation was made? That's the only way I'm gonna get it from the tax collector.~ /*Well, I can't afford much, but if I give something, maybe someone else will too. Who knows, I might end up with the plague and get it back.*/
@40 = ~W-what? You... you don't mean that, do you? I don't have anything here worth my life! I'm... I'm nobody!~
@41 = ~Then no one will miss you! Pay or die!~
@42 = ~I am sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.~
@43 = ~Well, make up your mind. YOU are the one imposing on ME~
@44 = ~That is where you are now. It is the business center of the city. Really, this should all be evident to you after just walking around.~
@45 = ~Home to the slums. The Beggar's Nest was poor enough before the Wailing. I don't want to think about what it would be like now.~
@46 = ~I don't go near there, especially not after I heard about all the thieves that were all over the district just recently. I mean, I just wouldn't feel safe.~
@47 = ~A district of selfish, hoarding nobles! I heard that one had even secreted away a huge reserve of food! Imagine, keeping that from the people who need it!~
@48 = ~I've got no reason to know anything about the Peninsula district. Only the roughest of our criminal element end up there.~
@49 = ~Don't hurt me! Isn't the plague bad enough without you stealing what little I have? Just take it and go... it's all the gold I have... Get out...~
@50 = ~I... I don't know what you are trying to pull, but I don't like it. Ask your questions and get out.~
@51 = ~I can't tell you anything about the place. I've been lucky enough to save a few coins here and there.~
@52 = ~I even heard that they were overrun with zombies, but I guess that has calmed down. Hey, I think I even heard it was someone like you in there helping. Ah, I doubt it.~
@53 = ~I don't know much about it. I try to stay away from the rougher areas of the city. I hear talk about pirates, but I wouldn't know.~
@54 = ~I guess the guards have been saying it's settled down now... you didn't have anything to do with that, hmm? No, I doubt a guard like that would have entered my home like this.~
@55 = ~The Blacklake district is the wealthiest part of the city. I don't have much cause to go there. I can't afford to look like I belong there.~
@56 = ~I think someone took care of him, but I haven't heard any details. Hmm... I think maybe they mentioned something about someone like you being in the area. I don't know, though.~
@57 = ~It's worse than the Docks, I hear. I've never been there, though.~
@58 = ~Oh, I did hear about some sort of trouble. Something about the Head Gaoler being taken over by something. It all sounded rather unpleasant to me. But, it's not my affair. Your kind probably keep a closer eye on that sort of thing. In fact, you look similar to the one I heard fixed the problem. Probably unrelated.~ /*But, it's not my affair. Your kind probably keep a closer eye on that sort of thing. In fact, you look similar to the one I heard fixed the problem. Probably unrelated.*/
@59 = ~Lord Nasher has pledged any needed resources to curing the plague. He has been quite supportive, as any leader would when tragedy strikes. Actually, I should say that it was his advisors that made his intentions known. Lord Nasher himself has wisely been locked away to protect against the plague.~ /*Lord Nasher has pledged any needed resources to curing the plague. He has been quite supportive, as any leader would when tragedy strikes.*/
@60 = ~NP: I don't know exactly, but she was at the forefront, working with people, organizing everything.... All we see are Helmites handing out their blessings. I don't know who they're serving. Maybe it's someone Aribeth started?~ /*The only people we see more are the Helmites, dispensing their blessings. I'm not sure who they report to. Someone under Aribeth?*/
@61 = ~NP: Wait... you don't have a ribbon... tape of an authorized fundraiser........ You bitch... I've been conned, haven't I... Get out... Get out of my house! Get out!!!~ /*You filthy... I've been had, haven't I... Get out... get out of my home! Get out!!*/
@62 = ~You again? I'm sorry, but is there really a reason for you to remain in my home?~
@63 = ~NP: You're a disgrace to our fair city. Get out of my sight.~ /*You <SIRMAAM>, are an absolute disgrace to this fine city. Get out of my sight.*/
