@0 = ~Hmmm... I don't recognize you, and I thought I knew all the new recruits who've joined the Lords' Alliance.~ [ROLKID60]
@1 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. I work for Aarin Gend.~
@2 = ~My name is none of your business!~
@3 = ~MT: <CHARNAME>?<CHARNAME> , the hero who saved Neverwinter from the plague? Hey,<MALEFEMALE> , such a person would be useful to us on the battlefield. It's too bad Gend has you harnessed somewhere else. You're probably here to buy something, aren't you? So, how can I interest you? Need a good sword? Or maybe a strong shield? Or something else?~ /*<CHARNAME>? The same <CHARNAME> who saved Neverwinter from the plague? We could use a good <PRO_MANWOMAN> like you up on the battle front.*/
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~I'd like to see your inventory.~
@6 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@7 = ~I'll be going now.~
@8 = ~MT: Yeah, so you like it like this? I don't need your name at all. I'm just trying to be polite... It's my job to provide soldiers, even freaks like you... So what can I interest you in? Need a good sword? Or maybe a strong shield? Or something else?~ /*So that's the attitude you want to take, is it? Your name doesn't really matter to me anyway. I was just trying to be friendly...*/
@9 = ~MT: Are you kidding me? Everyone knows me! I'm Rolkid Big Spear! I'm probably the most famous dwarf knight in Neverwinter! Aarin Gend has made me responsible for training and equipping the troops fighting against Luskan's army. He seems to be too busy looking for those Words of Power to think about something as small as war!~ /*Aarin Gend's put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he's too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!*/
@10 = ~Well, that's what I'm here for: armor and weapons for sale at reasonable prices. Take a look and see if there's anything you like.~
@11 = ~MT: The truth is, I don't have time to play the information desk. I'm busy trying to make war, you know. Aarin Gend has made me responsible for training and equipping the troops fighting against Luskan's army. He seems to be too busy looking for those Words of Power to think about something as small as war!~ /*Aarin Gend's put me in charge of training and equiping the troops battling the Luskan forces. Seems he's too busy searching for those Words of Power to bother with a little thing like a war!*/
@12 = ~Feel free to come on back if you ever need anything in the way of martial supplies. The more armed soldiers we get into the field, the better our chances of defeating those Luskan dogs!~
@13 = ~Normally I wouldn't complain, but this isn't exactly what I signed on for. We can't fight a war with no supplies!~
@14 = ~No supplies? What are you talking about?~
@15 = ~MT: It's too bad that those damn orc bandits cut off all the supply lines, but now that they've been destroyed, my job still doesn't get any easier. There are rumors that King Obold the Multishot is about to form an alliance with Luskan. If they join forces, we won't stand a chance, no matter how many soldiers and swords I send to the front lines.~ /*Rumor is King Obould Many-Arrows is forming an alliance with Luskan. If they combine forces we won't stand a chance, no matter how many soldiers and swords I send to the front lines.*/
@16 = ~King Obould Many-Arrows? Who's that?~
@17 = ~I have the head of King Obould Many-Arrows.~
@18 = ~I guess I shouldn't complain. Everyone has to do their part. But you didn't come to listen to me grumble. Do you need some supplies, or was there something else?~
@19 = ~MT: Those damn orc raiders. Every time we try to get supplies, those damn bandits cut us off! If an army is not supplied, that army ceases to be effective. I'm telling you, if things continue like this, we can surrender to those damn Luskans right now!~ /*An army's no good if they don't have a steady stream of supplies replenishing their stores. I tell you, if this keeps up we might as well surrender to Luskan right now!*/
@20 = ~MT: Maybe I can fix the problem.~ /*Maybe I could help you.*/
@21 = ~MT: King Obold the Multishot is perhaps the most powerful orc chieftain in the entire north. According to the spies lent to me by Aarin Gend, Obold made an agreement with the commanders of the Luskan army. Dealing with orc bandits is one thing, but Obold's tribe is a powerful and very skilled army. If he teamed up with Luskan, Neverwinter could be in serious trouble.~ /*King Obould Many-Arrows is probably the most powerful Orc Chieftain in the entire North. According to a couple of those spies Aarin Gend lent me Obould has arranged a parlay with the Luskan commanders.*/
@22 = ~So what do you want me to do?~
@23 = ~MT: Phew, this Obold is even uglier than I thought. And the flies that ate his eyes don't add to his charm. It does not matter, the stake is already sharpened and is waiting, can not wait until this terrible head is planted on it. Here are the promised 1000 gold. Now that Obold and his followers are out of the game, we may be able to start winning this war.~ /*Wow, Obould's even uglier than I imagined. The flies eating out his eyes probably don't help. No matter, I've got a stake all sharpened up and waiting for this one.*/
@24 = ~MT: Save Food Supplies The head of Obold the Multishot has been delivered to Rolkid Bigspear, and the threat to the Lords' Union's food supplies has been eliminated once and for all.~ /*The head of Obould Many-Arrows has been delivered to Rolkid of the Mighty lance, and the threat to the Lords' Alliance supply lines has been well and truly vanquished.*/
@25 = ~MT: Look, I'm going to need any help you can offer. I have already announced that a bounty will be paid on the heads of two of the most notorious orc bandits in the area, Vaat and Guzud. I think if we kill both of them, the rest of the thieves will understand this warning and leave us alone. I offer 500 gold for each head, as soon as you bring the head, I pay the money.~ /*Hey, I'll welcome any help I can get. I've already put out a bounty on the heads of the two most famous Orc bandits in the region: Vaath and Guzud.*/
@26 = ~I'll be back to collect those bounties!~
@27 = ~Any idea where I could start looking for those bandits?~
@28 = ~MT: I have the heads of Guzud and Vaat.~ /*I have Guzud's head.*/
@29 = ~I want you to bring me Obould's head on a platter! That should trigger a brutal power struggle as Obould's generals try to take the place of their fallen king. It'll keep them orcs busy for a few years, and out of our hair.~
@30 = ~Good luck. It won't be easy to find those bandit hideouts. Vaath and Guzud have both been in business for years and no one's tracked them down yet. Take this writ, though. It identifies you as a bounty hunter under my authority.~
@31 = ~MT: Save food supplies Rolkid Bigspear, who is in charge of food supplies at Beorunn's Well, wants to send word to the raiders who are disrupting food supplies from the Lords' Alliance. He offered a substantial reward to anyone who would bring him the heads of two famous orc bandits: Vaat and Guzud.~ /*Rolkid of the Mighty Lance, supply master for Beorunna's Well, wants to send a message to the raiders attacking the Lords' Alliance supply lines. 
He has offered a substantial bounty to anyone who delivers him the heads of the infamous orc bandits Vaath and Guzud.*/
@32 = ~MT: You can try looking in the Forest of Chill to the northeast; it was always full of bandits. There were also reports of bandits attacking south of Fort Ilkard. I can't tell you more. Finding them will be hard enough. And even harder to kill.~ /*You could try looking in the Coldwood to the northeast; that place has always had its share of bandits. And there were some reports of bandits around Fort Ilkard to the south.*/
@33 = ~MT: Well, I hope Waat and Guzud won't interfere with our food delivery routes anymore! I think we should hang their heads on a stake next to the barracks... raise the morale of the troops and all that. Here's the bounty on this bandit's head: 1000 gold, just like I promised. It's good to know that now that Vaat and Guzud are dead, our supplies will be all right.~ /*Well, I guess Vaath won't be cutting off our supply lines anymore! I think I'm going to mount his head on a stake right outside the barracks... it's good for morale and all.*/
@34 = ~MT: Save Food Supplies The heads of the orc bandits Vaat and Guzud are emblazoned on two stakes on either side of the entrance to the soldiers' barracks in Beorunn's Well. No longer will these notorious raiders interfere with the food supply of the Lords' Union.~ /*This dwarf is one of the many commoners who has come to Beorunna's Well to join the Lords' Alliance Cause.*/
@35 = ~MT: The only problem is that no one knows where this meeting is supposed to take place. King Obold is somewhere in the area, perhaps hiding with his bodyguards in some stinking, rotten cave. Find Obold's lair and destroy the orc chieftain. Bring me his head and I will pay you 1000 gold. Let's see how those Luskan dogs try to make an alliance with him!~ /*Only problem is, no one knows where or when this meeting is supposed to happen. King Obould must be somewhere in the area, probably hiding out with his honor guard in some stink-ridden cave.*/
@36 = ~The heads of the orcish bandits Vaath and Guzud adorn the twin stakes flanking the entrance to the soldiers barracks in Beournna's Well. The infamous raiders will trouble the supply lines of the Lords' Alliance no more.
Rolkid now seeks the head of Obould Many-Arrows, a powerful orcish chieftain, to complete his collection. Needless to say, he has put up a substantial reward.~
@37 = ~MT: Do you have orc heads for me? Or do you need my help?~ /*Have you a question for me, then, my friend?*/
@38 = ~Back again, <CHARNAME>? You need to buy some equipment, or is there something else I can do for you?~ [ROLKID58]
@39 = ~Welcome back. How's the life of the bounty hunter treating you? You bring any orc heads back for me? Or is there something else I can do for you?~ [ROLKID59]
@40 = ~Hello, again. If you've come to me looking for work, you're out of luck. With Guzud, Vaath and Obould all out of the picture I'm not handing out anymore bounties. Or was there something else you needed?~
