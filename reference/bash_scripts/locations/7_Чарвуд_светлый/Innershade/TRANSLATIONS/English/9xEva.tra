@0    = ~You... you have purchased a very well-made hammer. It is... a really fine weapon. Please, take care of it. It was made by a fair blacksmith I knew. And don't look at me like that! I just wanted to tell you that, since it is true.~
@1    = ~Oh, what an interesting <DAY_NIGHT>! I am quite surprised to see an adventuring woman! I am glad that another woman can show those male pigs they are not the only strong ones! Ha! They only think about fighting and sex! Oh, and their smell... But where are my manners? I am Eva, the blacksmith of this village. I am pleased to meet you.~
@2    = ~I see you're a woman who knows what she wants. I am <CHARNAME>.~
@3    = ~I'm here to take a look at some weapons and armor. Can you show me your wares?~
@4    = ~Well, Stongheart warned me what you were like.~
@5    = ~Well... I just wanted to see the inside of this building. I have to go. Bye!~
@6    = ~What do you want?! Another foolish... Ah, it's you. I thought one of those from Innershade had come for something from me.~
@7    = ~I see you haven't changed a bit. Abrasive as always.~
@8    = ~I'm here to take a look at some weapons and armor. May I?~
@9    = ~(Lie) I killed Strongheart. I hope you'll be more cheerfulfrom now on.~
@10   = ~I have to go. Bye!~
@11   = ~Now, a woman has to be like that! If not, then she will be under the oppression of men! I am not one to keep silent when something is not right, and I think you should be the same! Trust me.~
@12   = ~Right. Can I see what you have in stock?~
@13   = ~Sorry, I have to go.~
@14   = ~Women usually select occupations other than that of blacksmith. Why did you decide to become one?~
@15   = ~Of course you can. Here, take look at these over here. I guarantee they are all of the highest quality, my friend!~
@16   = ~You spoke to that scum?! You shouldn't have! He is nothing but a pig! He thinks that a strong man is a necessity for a woman! What a self-centred creature! Bah! I do not need someone like that! He probably lost his mind long ago, and now he has only his penis to think with! I hope his axe will "slip" and get rid of that pathetic little thing one day.~
@17   = ~However, probably yes, I am like that, and I do not want to change! Know that. I am not a silly little girl, a servant in the tavern, or a thing fit only for a man's entertainment!~
@18   = ~But perhaps I can help you with this feud with Strongheart?~
@19   = ~I see. Can I see what you have in stock?~
@20   = ~I have to go.~
@21   = ~No. It's not your business. If I want to talk with him one day, I will do so! Leave this matter alone, girl.~
@22   = ~All right, then! If you need high quality armor, come and visit me.~
@23   = ~Well, you do like to ask questions, aye? I was sick of cooking meals, cleaning, and living as though I was a slave; someone who does not know how to use muscles and a hammer! It should be obvious to you. You are an adventurer. You know how to fight! Would you exchange adventuring for housecleaning?~
@24   = ~Of course I wouldn't do that! Adventuring is my life.~
@25   = ~Perhaps. My adventuring will end, someday.~
@26   = ~I think it's not your business. May I take a look at what you have to offer?~
@27   = ~Whatever... I have to go.~
@28   = ~I knew that! We are somewhat similar! We are both strong, and we make something of our lives!~
@29   = ~What rubbish! Adventuring is my life, and I will fight to my last day! I will not kneel for any man! Hah, that's a sure thing!~
@30   = ~But enough of stories. Do you need something?~
@31   = ~Yes. May I take a look at your wares?~
@32   = ~No. Goodbye!~
@33   = ~Another pathetic man, I see! Just wonderful! There are more than enough idiots like you in Innershade! You think that you are so great, aye? I am Eva, but do not expect that I will be a smiling servant of yours, "good sir"! What do you want?~
@34   = ~Well, you're obviously a strong woman... I am <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@35   = ~Remember that I'm your customer! I would like to see your wares.~
@36   = ~Well, Stongheart warned me how you would be. Even your speech is a bit... interesting!~
@37   = ~Whatever. I'm leaving.~
@38   = ~So it's you again? What do you want, pig?~
@39   = ~Well, you're obviously a strong woman... I'm glad to see you again.~
@40   = ~I want to see your wares, Eva.~
@41   = ~Who you think you are? Do you think you will charm me with a few kind words? Ha! I am not that kind of woman! If you are looking for a whore, go to Athkatla! There, you will probably find a "companion" suited to you, though you will have to pay!~
@42   = ~Whatever. I just want to see your wares.~
@43   = ~Well, you really are exactly as Stongheart described.~
@44   = ~I'm leaving.~
@45   = ~Take a look then, and be quick about it! I am busy!~
@46   = ~You spoke to that piece of filth? He is nothing but a pig! He thinks that a strong man is a necessity for a woman! What a self-centred creature! Probably just like you! Bah! I do not need someone like that! He lost his mind long ago, and now he thinks with his penis! I hope his axe will "slip" and get rid of that pathetic little thing one day.~
@47   = ~Yes, I am just as he said! Know that, male. I am not a silly little girl, a servant in the tavern, someone for a man's entertainment!~
@48   = ~Perhaps you should talk with Strongheart?~
@49   = ~I will, but for now, show me your wares.~
@50   = ~No, and it's not your business! Bug off!~
@51   = ~Oh, do not think I will cry because of that!~
@52   = ~So, you lied to me! Well, to be honest I am glad... Pigs may be useful from time to time! But now I have to visit him with some medicine. I hope he will get better soon.~
@53   = ~What?! You idiot! You... You did what?! I have to go there... He can't be dead!~
