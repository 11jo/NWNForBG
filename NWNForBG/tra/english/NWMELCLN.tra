@6 = ~Do you know anything of interest about Blacklake?~
@7 = ~Heh, most o' the rich folk round these parts jus' call me the Cleaning Lady. Weren't always so, of course. Once I had me a pretty name to match me face. The city pays me a bit o' coin to go around the district and keep it tidy, sure enough. I also takes in laundry from me neighbours.~ /*Heh, most o' the rich folk round these parts jus' call me the Cleaning Lady. Weren't always so, of course. Once I had me a pretty name to match me face.*/
@8 = ~So you've been in every house in the area?~
@9 = ~So... what, exactly, do you clean?~

@20 = ~NP: Well, not in all, of course, but, in general, there are so many of them here that there is no difference.~ /*Not every house, silly <PRO_GIRLBOY>, but close enough as it makes no difference.*/
@21 = ~Are there certain estates you don't go into?~
@22 = ~I keeps the streets an' such swept around here. An' to get a few extra coppers I takes in laundry from the neighbours, aye. I keep quite a few houses clean too. Not every house, but close enough.~ /*I keeps the streets an' such swept around here. An' to get a few extra coppers I takes in laundry from the neighbours, aye.*/
@23 = ~Oh, I'm sure there's some that'd like everyone to think that, but it weren't true. There's servants an' poor folk alike here in the Blacklake. Don't think we aren't thankful for the ones that live here, none. If it weren't for them, we poor folk'd be the first to feel the touch of the plague, we would.~ /*Don't think we aren't thankful for the ones that live here, none. If it weren't for them, we poor folk'd be the first to feel the touch of the plague, we would.*/

@32 = ~NP: Hee hee ... I really need an assistant to wash clothes. I can even give you a coin... Hee-hee-hee... oh, never mind. What else do you need?~ /*Hee hee... I needs a hand with the laundry scrubbin'. I can spare a copper for ye, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Heh heeee... ah, don't mind me none.*/
@33 = ~NP: I don't know what to aim for<RACE> like you. Well, go to the &quot;Bare Board&quot; ... however, strange things are said about it. I've never been there. What else do you need?~ /*Not sure what a young <PRO_GIRLBOY> like you would like. Maybe go to the Board Laid Bare by the gate... 'tis got a strange reputation, they says. Never been there, meself.*/
@34 = ~Oh, my! Ye certainly wouldn't catch me going to Meldanen's estate to take 'is laundry, of all things, no no no. Mind you, there was a time... Ahhhh, but I should not talk about such things.

@37 = ~Could I ask you some other questions?~
@38 = ~Well... there's some folks who think the keepers at the zoo should be killin' all their animals. Somethin' about them coming from Waterdeep or somesuch. Don't know why that would be. The zookeep's talked plenty to the city guard not so long ago... you'd think they'd know their business. What else did ye need?~ /*Well... there's some folks who think the keepers at the zoo should be killin' all their animals. Somethin' about them coming from Waterdeep or somesuch.*/
@39 = ~I don't know anything other than all the babble... but ye could hears that anywhere, I'm sure. What else did ye need?~ /*I don't know anything other than all the babble... but ye could hears that anywhere, I'm sure.*/
@40 = ~Eh... they says that Meldanen the wizard keeps himself a collection o' beasties, but I don't know anything about how recent he got them. You can't talk to him, though. I heard he got put in his place by someone. Nothing happening in the district now. Was there something you needed?~ /*You can't talk to him, though. I heard he got put in his place by someone. Nothing happening in the district now.*/
@41 = ~Why don't ye give it a visit and see for yerself? Them noble types always likes to show off their pretty critters, they does. It be on the north end o' the district.

@42 = ~I s'pose not, at that. Formosa's been stirrin' up trouble at the square, they says, trying to turn everyone against the wizard. Bah, best ye hears such things for yerself, I can't make no sense of it. The square's in the southwest part o' the district... and Formosa's there, no doubt. What else did ye need?~ /*Bah, best ye hears such things for yerself, I can't make no sense of it. The square's in the southwest part o' the district... and Formosa's there, no doubt.*/
@43 = ~NP: There were troubles with Formosa. but everything has already settled down. Formosa, they say, stirred up the people in the square, persuaded the magician to fight. Well, someone killed her, they say Meldanen took revenge. What else do you need?~ /*I s'pose not, at that. Formosa's been stirrin' up trouble at the square, they says, trying to turn everyone against the wizard.*/
@44 = ~Aye, if ye wish. I be in no hurry to continue me work.~
@45 = ~Oh, t'was a long time ago, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, when I were a pretty lass. Meldanen were a young nobleman, then, an' handsome besides. His father, rest 'is soul, didn't approve of me none, so young Meldanen used t' sneak me into the estate, he did. Hee hee! But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.~ /*But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.*/
@46 = ~NP: But, if he secretly made his way there, maybe this entrance still exists?~ /*If he snuck you into the estate, perhaps that entrance still exists?*/
@47 = ~You might know some secrets about Meldanen, then?~
@48 = ~Nay, nay. They say it's best not to talk about the wizard, an' I agree. T'is of no importance, besides.~
@49 = ~NP: Ugh, threaten an old woman, how are you? Yes, it all happened and passed, and it has grown.~ /*Hey, I was just testing you. You passed. Well done.*/
@50 = ~NP: Er...they say the wizard Meldanen had a collection of animals, but I don't know if he still has them. If you want to talk to him, then go to his mansion. He just doesn't like visitors. Do you need anything else?~ /*Eh... they says that Meldanen the wizard keeps himself a collection o' beasties, but I don't know anything about how recent he got them.*/
@51 = ~Oh, aye, that it does. Meldanen had a magic door put into me very own home which leads into his estate. It would open for me at midnight, ye see. I keeps the door closed an' shuttered, now. No idea if it even still opens none... I be hopin' Meldanen's gone an' forgotten about little me.~ /*Oh, aye, that it does. Meldanen had a magic door put into me very own home which leads into his estate. It would open for me at midnight, ye see.*/
@52 = ~Ahhh, it be far too many years gone by, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. The wizard's secrets are 'is own, and I be no more privy to them then anyone else here. They say that Meldanen keeps a strange lot o' creatures in his estate, though, and I don't doubt it none. He were always fascinated by such. Even when he were young, he kept strange worms an' a beastie bird that ate bloody meat. But I'll talk no more about that, no.~ /*He were always fascinated by such. Even when he were young, he kept strange worms an' a beastie bird that ate bloody meat. But I'll talk no more about that, no.*/
@53 = ~NP: I was a pretty girl, and Meldanen was a handsome aristocrat. His dad, rest his soul in peace, did not approve of me, so young Meldanen secretly escorted me to the house, yes, it was the case. Hee hee! But that was long before Meldanen was a wizard and all. He doesn't need the poor old woman anymore, so that's all in the past.~ /*But that were long before Meldanen became a wizard an' such. He's no use for a poor old woman no more, an' it's best left in the past.*/
@54 = ~If ye wish to use it some, me home be on the north end o' the district. Here be my key. Take it. Jus' don't make a mess, mind you. I don't really have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard anyway, so I don't think I need to worry about you. Just use the key and go on in.~ /*I don't really have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard anyway, so I don't think I need to worry about you. Just use the key and go on in.*/
@55 = ~I am grateful. Take these ten gold pieces as a gift from me.~
@56 = ~NP: I no longer have the key. You will have to find it if you want to enter there. My house is almost in the very center of the area. Trust me, I don't have anything worth stealing in there, but you look like a guard, so I don't think there's anything to worry about.~ /*I already gave out my key. You'll have to find it if you want to be going in there. My home be in the north end o' the district*/
@57 = ~Thank you, me <PRO_LADYLORD>... 'tis a fair amount of coin for a poor old woman to own. Ye're very kind.~
@58 = ~Aye, farewell to ye.~
@59 = ~You just stay right where ye are, <PRO_GIRLBOY>, so I can keep an eye on ye.~
