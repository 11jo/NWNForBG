@0 = ~Ulak sabba por! Poad hisa ul pathcea fea gal!~ [LOKAR50]
@1 = ~I'm sorry, I don't understand you.~
@2 = ~What are you trying to say?~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~Jula va pekito. Rawa asagus.~
@5 = ~You must be careful! I will help you if I can, but if the Masters see us speaking they will cut out my tongue.~ [LOKAR51]
@6 = ~Who are you?~
@7 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@8 = ~Why are you helping me?~
@9 = ~I am Lokar, leader of the slaves. I often help those who have escaped the chains of the Creator Race, as you have obviously done.~
@10 = ~I am no escaped slave! I am a visitor from the distant future.~
@11 = ~I will tell you what I can, if it will help against the Creator Race that enslaves us.~
@12 = ~What can you tell me about the Creator Race?~
@13 = ~What is this place you are building?~
@14 = ~I am searching for one of the Words of Power.~
@15 = ~I wish there was more I could do for you. Every slave that escapes is a victory for our people and a blow against the tyranny of the Creator Race. May luck be with you.~
@16 = ~Of course, I understand now. You have lost your mind, probably from the beatings of your cruel Mistress. No wonder you have risked everything to escape.~
@17 = ~I'm not crazy! I really am from the future.~
@18 = ~NP: I can only tell you the simplest things. The people of the Lizard firmly hold the whole world in a fist. They enslave us as inferior races, force us to serve the Reptilian Mistresses until death. They are wild and cruel, and do not care for those who serve them. Many slaves died during the construction of this complex under the whips of the Lord. Im afraid thats all I know about the Creator Race.~ /*I can tell you only what is common knowledge. The Lizard People rule the world with a terrible scaled fist. They enslave us lesser races, forcing us to serve the reptilian Mistresses until our deaths.*/
@19 = ~The Mistresses are forcing us to build a great fortress complex. At its heart we are constructing an enormous vault that will be protected by various magical wards once it is complete - though what our Masters plan to place inside the vault I cannot say.~
@20 = ~Can you tell me anything else about this vault?~
@21 = ~What was that you said about magical wards?~
@22 = ~Do you know some way I can get into the vault?~
@23 = ~Thank you for your help. I will be going now.~
@24 = ~I am sorry, I have not heard of such a thing. But I am only a slave, born into servitude. My knowledge is limited to what the Mistresses tell me. This Word may indeed be here.~
@25 = ~NP: I admit that your appearance is surprising to me, but the empire of the Lords extends very, very far, and to exotic places too. Sometimes they bring slaves of races and cultures that no one has seen in this part of the world. I find it hard to believe that you are from the future. But I dont want to upset you. If you think your home is in the distant future, I wont mind. I just want to help you.~ /*I admit your appearance is strange to me, but the Mistresses' empire extends to distant, exotic lands. Often they bring back slaves of races and cultures never before seen in this part of the world.*/
@26 = ~I am afraid I cannot tell you much more about the vault as I have not worked on it myself. There are other slaves who are more involved in the construction of the central vault. If you find them, perhaps they will have answers I do not.~
@27 = ~NP: Right now the vault is empty and unguarded - you can go there if you want. But once construction is complete, the vault will be guarded by the full might of the three magical guards. I dont know much about these magical guardians, but I suspect that once they are turned on, it will be impossible to enter the vault without turning them off. Is there anything else I can tell you?~ /*Right now the vault is unguarded and empty - you could enter it if you wish. But once this complex is complete the vault will be sealed by the power of three magical wards.*/
@28 = ~Take this ring before you go. Show it to the other slaves in the complex, and they will be more willing to risk themselves to help you.~
@29 = ~You have returned. Is there something else you wish to know about the vault we are building or the magical wards protecting it?~ [LOKAR52]
