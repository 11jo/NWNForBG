@0 = ~NP: Excuse me, but where is <CHARNAME>? I'll only talk to him.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. I am searching for the Words of Power.*/
@1 = ~Do not give up hope, my Lord. We still have the Words of Power, after all.~ [AARIN471]
@2 = ~Perhaps Haedraline will reveal their secret to us - if you release her from the dungeons.~ [AARIN472]
@3 = ~Haedraline told us about the secret door beneath Castle Never. Without her we would never have found the Source Stone.~ [AARIN473]
@4 = ~Perhaps Haedraline will speak to <CHARNAME>. She has spoken with <PRO_HIMHER> before.~ [AARIN474]
@5 = ~Her actions are not without reason, Lord Nasher. Neverwinter turned its back on her when it executed her lover, Fenthick.~ [AARIN475]
@6 = ~When I came into your service, Lord Nasher, you asked if I would serve you faithfully. Do you remember what I said?~ [AARIN476]
@7 = ~I am still by your side, Lord Nasher. But Fenthick and Aribeth were lovers. In her eyes you gave Fenthick as a sacrifice to appease the unruly mob.~ [AARIN477]
@8 = ~You must speak with Lord Nasher first, <CHARNAME>.~ [AARIN570]
@9 = ~Once you have spoken with him you may return and speak to me.~ [AARIN571]
@10 = ~These are indeed dark times, <CHARNAME> - though not so dark as Lord Nasher portrays them. The people of Neverwinter are made of sterner stuff than any of us imagine.~ [AARIN516]
@11 = ~But if Neverwinter is to survive we must all play our part. My place is here, by Lord Nasher's side. I must oversee every aspect of the defense of the city.~ [AARIN517]
@12 = ~And your own part is one you know all too well. You must save Neverwinter once more - though how you might accomplish this I cannot say. Perhaps the creature Haedraline knows something of this.~ [AARIN518]
@13 = ~I have the fourth Word of Power.~
@14 = ~Maugrim is dead.~
@15 = ~Haedraline told me some information I think you should hear.~
@16 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@17 = ~I wanted to see how you were holding up, Aarin.~
@18 = ~I must be on my way.~
@19 = ~Some of my operatives reported that you had recovered the fourth Word of Power, <CHARNAME>. I wasn't surprised, given all your previous accomplishments.~ [AARIN490]
@20 = ~Now that we have all four Words we may be able to unlock their power, Lord Nasher.~ [AARIN491]
@21 = ~No - but I suspect Haedraline understands their mysteries. She might be willing to share her secrets with <CHARNAME>.~ [AARIN492]
@22 = ~I am afraid Lord Nasher is right - you should speak to Haedraline about this. Is there anything else you need, <CHARNAME>?~ [AARIN493]
@23 = ~Yes, I heard he met a fittingly violent end. Yet the enemy's spirit is not broken. Others step forward from the ranks to assume the leadership of Luskan's army.~ [AARIN494]
@24 = ~Haedraline does not trust us, I fear. Understandable, considering the reception she received upon her arrival. You are the only one she is willing to speak to.~ [AARIN518]
@25 = ~I once knew every secret in this city, but these are turbulent times and even I am left stumbling in the dark. Yet I will tell you whatever I can.~ [AARIN519]
@26 = ~What can you tell me about Haedraline?~
@27 = ~What can you tell me about the Words of Power?~
@28 = ~What can you tell me about the Source Stone?~
@29 = ~What's the latest news of from the battle lines?~
@30 = ~I want to ask you about Aribeth.~
@31 = ~I'm interested in knowing more about Lord Nasher.~
@32 = ~As well as can be expected, my love. These are difficult times for all concerned.~ [AARIN512]
@33 = ~You should speak to Haedraline before you go, <CHARNAME>. Maybe she will tell you something about the Source Stone or the Words of Power.~ [AARIN567]
@34 = ~Yes, <CHARNAME> - there is still much that must be done if Neverwinter is to be saved.~ [AARIN569]
@35 = ~As we feared, there is some darker power behind the invaders than even Maugrim. All we can do is hold on as long as we are able, and pray help arrives in time.~ [AARIN495]
@36 = ~Perhaps it would be best if you kept her secrets. If she wishes to share them with us she will send for either Lord Nasher or myself.~ [AARIN498]
@37 = ~That's a strange thing for a spymaster to say.~
@38 = ~You're right, Aarin. You can't help me with this anyway.~
@39 = ~She arrived here shortly after the third Word of Power was delivered to Castle Never. Lord Nasher suspected she was a spy and had her imprisoned in the dungeons.~ [AARIN520]
@40 = ~Lord Nasher gave them to Master Ford, chief archeologist of Neverwinter. He believes there is a link between the Words and the Source Stone.~ [AARIN519]
@41 = ~Haedraline told us about the Source Stone and secret door beneath Castle Never. As spy master I'm embarrassed to admit I never suspected there were hidden chambers beneath our dungeons before this.~ [AARIN531]
@42 = ~Things have calmed since the initial onslaught. The defenders fell back to the City Core, but I do not know how long we will be able to hold it.~ [AARIN534]
@43 = ~I understand your concern for her, <CHARNAME>, but I do not know what to tell you. Her fate has yet to be decided.~ [AARIN555]
@44 = ~It pains me to talk of her. There was a time when I considered her a champion of Neverwinter and I called her 'friend'.~ [AARIN558]
@45 = ~He was once a great adventurer, you know. I wish you could have known him then - a true hero in all his magnificent glory.~ [AARIN563]
@46 = ~I am glad you stand with me in this, <CHARNAME>. But if we are to save Neverwinter we cannot let our feelings for each other distract us. We must stay focused on the task at hand.~ [AARIN509]
@47 = ~My instincts tell me that she is the key if Neverwinter is to be saved - and I have learned to trust my instincts.~ [AARIN568]
@48 = ~Led by Aribeth and Maugrim the Luskan forces have all but overrun Neverwinter. Even slaying the leaders might not be enough to turn the tide of battle at this point.
Aarin Gend feels Haedraline, the mysterious lizard creature now languishing in the dungeons of Castle Never, might know a way to save the city. 

Only she can reveal the secrets of the Words of Power and the recently discovered Source Stone, although there is hope that Master Ford - presently studying the Source Stone in the caverns beneath the dungeon of Castle Never - might have some information to share as well.~
@49 = ~Is there something else you need, <CHARNAME>? If not, I should get back to my reconnaissance reports.~ [AARIN496]
@50 = ~I am more than just a spymaster now, <CHARNAME>. I am responsible for coordinating the entire defense of Neverwinter. I will not risk alienating a potential ally in Haedraline.~ [AARIN499]
@51 = ~If we had the manpower I would place an entire company at your disposal. But I need every warm body on the battle lines just to keep Luskan from taking the City Core.~ [AARIN501]
@52 = ~After Aribeth's betrayal he has grown overly cautious, and I fear it has made Haedraline mistrustful of us. She did tell us about the Source Stone beneath the castle, but nothing beyond that.~ [AARIN521]
@53 = ~But Master Ford has not been able to learn anything more about the Words of Power or the Source Stone, unfortunately.~ [AARIN528]
@54 = ~Where can I find Master Ford?~
@55 = ~When we found the Stone Lord Nasher put Master Ford, Neverwinter's leading archeological expert, in charge of studying it.~ [AARIN532]
@56 = ~We are badly outnumbered, and Aribeth knew every inch of this city. All her knowledge is being used against us now.~ [AARIN535]
@57 = ~What if I could kill Aribeth and Maugrim?~
@58 = ~Maugrim's death has had little effect on the battle. It seems he was not the true force behind our enemy.~ [AARIN541]
@59 = ~What do you mean?~
@60 = ~As long as the war continues, Lord Nasher will keep her alive so she can continue to provide information about the Luskan forces.~ [AARIN556]
@61 = ~Her betrayal struck us all hard, especially Lord Nasher. He will not admit it, but I imagine the situation was made even worse by the guilt he felt over Fenthick's execution.~ [AARIN559]
@62 = ~He is a different man now. Still a good man, but the bureaucracy and responsibility of leadership weigh heavily on him. He has grown somber and serious.~ [AARIN564]
@63 = ~I trust you, <CHARNAME>, and I suspect that whatever information Haedraline has shared is something I cannot help you with in any case.~ [AARIN500]
@64 = ~You will have to act on Haedraline's information on your own, I'm afraid. Is there anything else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ [AARIN502]
@65 = ~Maybe you could try speaking to her. She trusts you. And I sense there's something important she's not telling us about the Words of Power and that Source Stone.~ [AARIN522]
@66 = ~Where can I find Haedraline?~
@67 = ~Can you let Haedraline out of the dungeon?~
@68 = ~Ever since we unearthed the Stone beneath the castle, Master Ford has spent all his time studying it.~ [AARIN529]
@69 = ~But so far the Source Stone has refused to give up its secrets. If you want to know more about it you should speak with Master Ford.~ [AARIN533]
@70 = ~I doubt it would help. Aribeth has likely shared our every weakness with all her generals by now.~ [AARIN536]
@71 = ~Surely you must feel it, <CHARNAME>? There is a shadow over Neverwinter, a curse that drags down morale and inspires our enemy.~ [AARIN542]
@72 = ~After that... well, the law is clear. But the law demanded Fenthick's death as well, and the consequences of his execution are plain for all to see.~ [AARIN557]
@73 = ~The law is the law. Aribeth deserves death.~
@74 = ~Her death will only continue the cycle of vengeance and bloodshed.~
@75 = ~On some level, my love, I even understand Aribeth's actions. I might have done the same, were you to suffer Fenthick's fate.~ [AARIN560]
@76 = ~I make no excuse for Aribeth's actions, but seeing the cheering crowds at her lover's execution might very well be what turned her against the city.~ [AARIN561]
@77 = ~And now, in Neverwinter's darkest hour, I fear he has given in to complete despair. Aribeth's betrayal, the guilt over Fenthick's execution, the slaughter of his people... sometimes the burden on Lord Nasher is too great.~ [AARIN565]
@78 = ~She's locked away in the castle dungeon. Just head south and down the stairs.~ [AARIN523]
@79 = ~Lord Nasher would never consent to that, I'm afraid. Not while we are besieged by a hostile army.~ [AARIN524]
@80 = ~If Maugrim were killed it might break the enemy's spirit, though in truth that also seems unlikely.~ [AARIN537]
@81 = ~Perhaps, on some level, the people of Neverwinter feel they deserve to suffer. I know Lord Nasher feels such guilt, at least. For what happened to Fenthick.~ [AARIN543]
@82 = ~Lord Nasher followed the law! He had no choice!~
@83 = ~Perhaps he can atone for what he has done.~
@84 = ~You cannot let your emotions get the better of you, <CHARNAME>. Aribeth has detailed information about the enemy that we need.~ [AARIN548]
@85 = ~I agree with you, <CHARNAME>... but it is not as simple as that. Aribeth's crimes cannot simply be ignored. Be glad we are not the ones who must decide her fate.~ [AARIN551]
@86 = ~But now is not the time to discuss whether Aribeth's actions were justified. We must stay focused on finding a way to save the city.~ [AARIN562]
@87 = ~Heavy is the head that wears the crown, they say. There is little we can do for him, other than trying to save the city. Is there anything else, <CHARNAME>?~ [AARIN566]
@88 = ~I doubt it would help, in any case. She does not trust us, plain and simple. Perhaps because of Aribeth's actions Haedraline fears everyone from Neverwinter is corruptible.~ [AARIN525]
@89 = ~Normally Luskan forces are but cowards and raiders. They hit and run. This time, however, something is different. Some sinister force drives our enemies forward.~ [AARIN538]
@90 = ~And there is a pall lingering in the air, a dark cloud hanging over all the defenders and driving them to despair.~ [AARIN539]
@91 = ~Is there no one who will come to our aid?~
@92 = ~Reinforcements from the Lords' Alliance are on their way, but I do not know if we can hold out until they get here.~ [AARIN540]
@93 = ~It's one thing to say the law is always right, <CHARNAME>. But there are exceptions to every rule.~ [AARIN544]
@94 = ~There is that hope. Lord Nasher will think long and hard before he executes Aribeth, I suspect. He may even let her live, if Neverwinter survives this invasion.~ [AARIN547]
@95 = ~She deserves death for what she did!~
@96 = ~Lord Nasher was haunted by Fenthick's execution, just as Aribeth was. Maybe, given a second chance, he would have acted differently.~ [AARIN552]
@97 = ~Fenthick's execution was legal, but even while he was pronouncing sentence I suspect Lord Nasher knew justice was not being served.~ [AARIN545]
@98 = ~Fenthick's death was born of anger and vengeance, plain and simple - the same motives behind Aribeth's betrayal. Lord Nasher is well aware we reap what we sow.~ [AARIN546]
@99 = ~Now, with Aribeth, he must face not only her betrayal but the demons of his own failures. But he is a good man, and in the end I trust he will make the wise decision.~ [AARIN553]
@100 = ~Organizing our remaing troops to withstand the next Luskan assault requires all my attention, <CHARNAME>. If the enemy breaches the City Core we are lost.~ [AARIN488]
@101 = ~I am afraid I can only spare a few moments for you, though I will try to help you however I can.~ [AARIN489]
@102 = ~Ah, my love - it is good to see you again. I only wish it were under less trying circumstances.~ [AARIN487]
@103 = ~NP: It is an honor to speak with you. You are now a hero of Neverwinter, your name will forever be written in the history of the city!~ /*Mommy says you're the hero of Neverwinter. I want to be a hero!*/
