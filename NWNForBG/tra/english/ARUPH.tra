@0 = ~NP: Stranger in Luskan... And besides<RACE> . The Cleaver hasnt had many visitors since the High Captains locked up the gates and docks... Let me greet you,<SIRMAAM> .~ /*A stranger to Luskan... and a <PRO_RACE> <PRO_MANWOMAN>, besides. The Cutlass Inn certainly hasn't gotten many visitors since the High Captains sealed the gates and the docks... allow me to welcome you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.*/
@1 = ~The fighting mostly bypasses my inn, so it's fairly safe if you wish to stay here. Supplies have been scarce... but I'll serve you as best I can.~
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~How much are your rooms?~
@4 = ~Could I ask you a few questions?~
@5 = ~NP: Goodbye, Ill go.~ /*Goodbye, and good luck.*/
@6 = ~NP: My name is Aruf Thunderfist, if you want to know. I am the owner of this tavern... Although in the state it is now, my tavern is not very attractive. Usually all seafarers and other travelers wandering into the city stop here. But at the moment there are only locals who are hiding from the street war.~ /*Normally we'd be bustling with all the sailor folk and other travelers that would come through the city. At the moment, all I've got are locals who are taking refuge from the fighting.*/
@7 = ~NP: Sorry. Id like to take you in, but the tavern is already full of refugees. However, one room has recently been vacated, but it is very expensive. Will you take?~ /*Sorry. I'd like to accomodate you, but the inn is packed to the rafters with refugees as it is.*/
@8 = ~Yes~
@9 = ~I suppose there's no harm in it. What would you like to know?~
@10 = ~Just what is going on in Luskan, anyway?~
@11 = ~Have you heard of any cults in the city?~
@12 = ~Is there anywhere I can find work here?~
@13 = ~How does one get into the Host Tower?~
@14 = ~Aye. Be wary if you head outside.~
@15 = ~NP: A. Well, thats a small question, isnt it? The High Captains have been fighting for weeks now, each trying to kill everyone else. They all just went crazy, they say that each of them wants to seize power over the city. The belligerents have already burned half the city. Pirates from Mirabar have sealed off this area.~ /*Ah. Well, that's the big question, isn't it? The High Captains have been fighting for weeks, now, each trying to kill the other. They've gone completely crazy, I've heard, each trying to take power in the city for himself.*/
@16 = ~NP: Hmph. There can be all sorts of religious cults here in Luskan, my friend, and no one cares. If its any comfort to you, I havent heard any rumors about cults. They heard about necromancers, but not about sectarians.~ /*If it makes you feel better, I haven't heard anything about cults. Necromancers, perhaps, but no cults.*/
@17 = ~What's this about necromancers?~
@18 = ~Can you think of anyone who might know more?~
@19 = ~Maybe I could ask you something else.~
@20 = ~NP: Almost no one works here. There is almost no one left in the city because of all these battles. However, if you are looking for adventure, I think there is a chance to find people for whom you can do something. Maybe you should talk to Mistress Londa. Or Elinwid. They are both here in the tavern, desperate to find their loved ones. Maybe they will hire you, I dont know.~ /*Hardly anyone is working. The city has more or less ground to a halt, for all the fighting. If you're the adventurous sort, though, I suppose there's people who'd want things done, still.*/
@21 = ~NP: Why would you sneak into the Masters Tower? No, wait... I dont want to know that. You wont get into the Masters Tower, I tell you for sure. There is a bridge to their island in the northwestern part of the parish, but you cant cross it unless the Brotherhood wants to. I believe the High Captains may know much more about this. They are the only ones who can go there of their own accord, believe me.~ /*You don't get into the Host Tower, that's just it. There's a bridge to their island up in the northwest part of the district, but you won't get across it unless the Brotherhood wants you to.*/
@22 = ~Tell me about the High Captains.~
@23 = ~NP: Rumor has it that the High Captains have sorcerers who summon monsters to fight for them... In a word, utter chaos.~ /*Some say High Captain Kurth is working with the Brotherhood to raise an army to take over the North.*/
@24 = ~Do you know what started all of this?~
@25 = ~Why doesn't someone put a stop to this?~
@26 = ~Have you heard any rumors?~
@27 = ~Is there any correlation between the plague in Neverwinter and the fighting, here?~
@28 = ~NP: The High Captains were always ready to bite each others throats, but they never stooped to openly fighting in the streets and creating all sorts of monsters. Maybe the Brotherhood of the Arcane needs only one High Captain in power. I can not say for sure. Everyone around knows that the real power belongs to the Brotherhood, however, it has so far interfered in these civil strife.~ /*Maybe the Arcane Brotherhood wants there to be only one High Captain. Not sure. Everyone knows the Brotherhood is the real power, here, but they haven't done a thing about all the fighting.*/
@29 = ~NP: Tell me about the Brotherhood of the Sacraments.~ /*Tell me more about the tower statue.*/
@30 = ~NP: Once there were five. Since the fighting began, three have died... or gone missing. I dont think anyone knows for sure. Of these, only two remained: Baram and Kurt. They say that both of them have gone crazy, they are trying by any means to kill each other.~ /*There used to be five of them. Since the fighting started, three of them have died... or gone missing. I suppose nobody really knows.*/
@31 = ~Tell me about Baram.~
@32 = ~Tell me about Kurth.~
@33 = ~NP: Who, for example? Luskan is not part of the Lords Alliance. The lords must be praying to the gods to burn this city to the ground. Each of the High Captains has crowds of soldiers at his disposal... No one can resist them. Except, perhaps, the Brotherhood of the Sacraments, but they do nothing.~ /*The High Captains each have hordes of soldiers under their command... nobody can stand up to them. Except maybe the Arcane Brotherhood, but they've done nothing.*/
@34 = ~NP: People are saying that High Captain Baram left and made an alliance with a gang of necromancers... And that it was he who called all the undead to the streets. It is said that Captain Kurt is working with the Brotherhood to raise an army and take over the north. Others say that Luskan has the same plague as Neverwinter, but here everyone just went crazy with it. I think its just stupid nonsense.~ /*Others say Luskan has the same plague as Neverwinter does, but here it's driven everyone mad. I say that's just crazy talk, though.*/
@35 = ~Aye, ask if you wish. I suppose I've not much else to do.~
@36 = ~NP: Oh... Nothing special. Its just that people are saying that High Captain Baram has contacted a bunch of necromancers. He recruits undead into his army. I doubt the Brotherhood will support this move. Of course, as far as I know, they themselves can be necromancers.~ /*Oh... nothing, really. Some say the High Captain Baram has aligned himself with a group of necromancers. Hence the undead in his forces.*/
@37 = ~About cults? Maybe the priests at the temple of Tempus, if they're still alive. Otherwise I can't think of a one.~
@38 = ~NP: Ah, yes, they are sorcerers. They live in the Masters Tower on their island off the coast. A powerful, mysterious group... Everyone knows that it is thanks to them that Luskan has such power as he does now. Although almost no one else knows anything about them. They dont allow anyone to land on the island... And there are rumors that they only talk to the High Captains.~ /*Oh, aye, sorcerers they are. They live in the Host Tower on their island just off the coast. Powerful, mysterious bunch... everyone knows they're the real reason Luskan has the power it does.*/
@39 = ~NP: High Captain Baram is a rather slippery type. No wonder he managed to survive. Once he had his own base in the slums, but it burned down, a long time ago. Some people say that he climbed into the sewers and lives there with rats. But I do not particularly believe in such gossip.~ /*High Captain Baram is a slippery one. I'm not surprised he's survived. He used to have his base down in the slums, but that was burnt down long ago.*/
@40 = ~NP: This is the most powerful of the High Captains... Or at least he was. His tower was not far, to the west of here, but it was destroyed last week. Im told hes gathered his Bloody Hands and barricaded himself in West Harbor. Now this area is closed, so I canâ€™t even imagine how you can get there if you suddenly need to.~ /*I'm told he's taken his Bloody Hands and barricaded himself in West Harbor. The district's all closed off so I'm not even sure how one would get in there now, if you cared to.*/
@41 = ~NP: Hmmmm. Now that you mention it, I remember that the news of the plague came here just as the fighting began. This explains why the High Captains have locked up the city. And they began to recruit into their troops all the strong pirates and smugglers hanging around in the ports. I bet theyve killed many more people there than this epidemic has claimed.~ /*They also started drafting every able-bodied pirate and smuggler that was stuck in the ports into their forces. The amount of men that have died here so far probably puts that plague to shame, I bet.*/
@42 = ~You see what I mean, though? You can't listen to that nonsense. Truth is, nobody knows what's going on.~
@43 = ~Why they're letting all this fighting go on is anyone's guess. It's not like we can ask them to put a stop to it.~
@44 = ~How do you get into the Host Tower, then?~
@45 = ~NP: You wont get into the Masters Tower, I tell you for sure. There is a bridge to their island in the northwestern part of the parish, but you cant cross it unless the Brotherhood wants to. I believe the High Captains may know much more about this. They are the only ones who can go there of their own accord, believe me.~ /*You don't get into the Host Tower, that's just it. There's a bridge to their island up in the northwest part of the district, but you won't get across it unless the Brotherhood wants you to.*/
@46 = ~Greetings, <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You are... from the northern forests, then? Normally I don't allow barbarians to stay at the Cutlass Inn, but since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks, I've had little enough business.~
@47 = ~I won't ask how you got into Luskan, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, but a holy <PRO_MANWOMAN> is always welcome in the Cutlass Inn. The gods know I've seen little enough business since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks... I can use all the divine favor I can get.~
@48 = ~Greetings, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. Have you come to find refuge at the Cutlass Inn, like most of these other folk? Business has been poor since the High Captains sealed the gates and docks, so I'm more than pleased to welcome you.~
@49 = ~Back already? What can I do for you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
