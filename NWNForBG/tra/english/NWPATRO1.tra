@0 = ~Came here from the soup kitchen before it got overrun. Damned guards couldn't help. They didn't even know where it was.~
@1 = ~Saw some fool mage in red fighting instead of running. Full of himself, he was. Now the street's full of him too.~
@2 = ~I coulda gone to that sanctuary instead of here, but I prefer sensible talk over their pipe dreams.~
@3 = ~That Drake fellah, he's something else, eh? An undead hunter! Good to see SOMEONE taking it to 'em!~
@4 = ~Those guards at the gate canna even keep their own safe. Lost that young fellah Walters, I hear.~
@5 = ~Harben and Drake are keeping folk busy, but the damn undead need to be stopped at the source.~
@6 = ~That Desther and his Helmites believe their "pat on the head" blessing actually helps. Hmpf! Ain't stopped anyone getting plagued yet!~
@7 = ~Sure, the Helmite sanctuary keeps zombies away, but you have to listen to their "blessing this" and "blessing that."~
@8 = ~The Helmites swear the city will be delivered through blessings. Bah! Drake and Harben will deliver us proper by killin' zombies!~
@9 = ~The undead cluster around the Great Graveyard, and nobody can get close. Barricaded up good, it is.~
@10 = ~I swear, the dead are rising faster than the plague is killin' people off! Gotta be connected somewhere.~
@11 = ~There's a few places that still have people in 'em. Speak with Drake if you want to check them out.~
@12 = ~I saw some strange stuff around the old warehouse in the northeast, but Drake might know more.~
@13 = ~Drake and Harben are working out a defence for people still trapped by zombies. You should go help.~
