@0 = ~Welcome to the Alliance Arms Inn. It is a pleasure to serve a hero at my humble establishment. Is there anything I can get for you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>?~
@1 = ~What do you charge for a room?~
@2 = ~I'm here to collect the new tavern tax.~
@3 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~NP: Goodbye, I'll go.~ /*Goodbye, and good luck.*/
@5 = ~Only 5 gold pieces for a quality room. I assure you, it will be a peaceful sleep after a hard day.~
@6 = ~That'll do.~
@7 = ~I already paid that tax to another person, so just forget about it. Now what do you want.~
@8 = ~A tax on taverns? That's outrageous! Lord Nasher must be out of his mind. Forget it, I'll never pay.~
@9 = ~Calm down man, it was only a joke.~
@10 = ~[Lie] You'll pay, or this tavern will be shut down on the orders of Lady Aribeth and Lord Nasher.~
@11 = ~(sigh) Just don't waste too much of my time. I am very busy, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@12 = ~Has there been anything odd going on around here?~
@13 = ~Do you know where I might find some work in town?~
@14 = ~Can you give me directions?~
@15 = ~NP: It's all right, I'll go.~ /*Nevermind.*/
@16 = ~Feel free to spend lots of money here at the Alliance Arms Inn, where paying customers are always welcome.~
@17 = ~A joke? You can't even begin to know how not funny that kind of joke is to an innkeep. Well... no harm done... I suppose. What can I do for you?~
@18 = ~NP: Okay, here's 100 gold. It's terrible when the ruler thinks that you can take taxes from the subjects for all sorts of nonsense. Now what do you need?~ /*Fine, here's 50 gold. It's a real shame when a ruler thinks he can just tax his subjects for every little thing.*/
@19 = ~NP: Let Lady Aribeth come here herself and demand the tax in person, then I will speak to her. What else do you need?~ /*Lady Aribeth wants to come down here and ask for more taxes in person, then I'll talk to her.*/
@20 = ~There has been trouble throughout the north this past while. Between plagues and werewolves a man can hardly step foot outside his inn.~
@21 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@22 = ~But the plague is over, why dwell on the past?~
@23 = ~Werewolves? Where did you hear about werewolves?~
@24 = ~Well, that doesn't interest me. Can I ask you some other questions?~
@25 = ~NP: A job for the soul seeking adventure? Well, for example, there is such an elf. He calls himself Elaith and has been asking everyone about adventurers for two days. I don't really understand what he wants, but maybe you should find out. He apparently has money.~ /*Some work for an adventurous soul? Well there is that elf over there. He calls himself "The Serpent" and has been inquiring about adventurers for a couple of days.*/
@26 = ~I will do that. Goodbye.~
@27 = ~I might, but first I have another question.~
@28 = ~If you really need to know, I suppose.~
@29 = ~Where can I find some supplies?~
@30 = ~NP: This place is called Port Llast. So there are docks around here somewhere?~ /*Why this place called Port Llast? You have docks here?*/
@31 = ~I'll bet a cup of wine would help you come up with more questions. Give it some thought.~
@32 = ~It's over, of course, but I don't know that the effects have entirely passed. Looters and bandits are always a problem, but nature also seems to feel the repercussions of something that severe.~
@33 = ~Nature? What do you mean?~
@34 = ~NP: Why don't we get back to more interesting topics?~ /*So why don't you go back to Waterdeep?*/
@35 = ~NP: It may have passed, but some believe that its effect could be much wider than the actual disease of people. Nature itself is still experiencing the consequences.~ /*It may be over, but there are some who suggest that the effects might be more wide-spread than just making people sick.*/
@36 = ~NP: Yes, that's all they talk about. Some knight came here and lured some guys to go hunt werewolves, but it didn't work out like that... Actually, it's probably easier for you to get first-hand information. Ender survived the whole mess. Now he is here, and he will tell this story better than I can.~ /*Actually it would probably be better to get the information first-hand. Ander is a survivor of the whole thing. He's in here this <DAYNIGHTALL> and he can tell the tale better than I can.*/
@37 = ~NP: Well, then I'll go talk to Ender. Goodbye.~ /*Well, I suppose I will go talk to Ander then. Goodbye.*/
@38 = ~Is there anyone else I should talk to about the werewolves?~
@39 = ~Maybe I should talk to him, but first could you answer another question?~
@40 = ~NP: For the usual supplies, I would suggest going to the Cracked Anvil in the city center. And that guy over there to my left, his name is Elchelor, sells various goods to fight werewolves.~ /*For normal supplies I would suggest the Cracked Anvil to the southeast.*/
@41 = ~Could you answer another question?~
@42 = ~That's all I need thank you.~
@43 = ~Yes <PRO_SIRMAAM>. The docks are located just west of here. They are fairly safe, at least as safe as things can be in these times.~
@44 = ~What do you mean?~
@45 = ~All right. I have a few more questions for you.~
@46 = ~NP: I have heard of strange happenings in Neverwinter Forest. Of course, these things may not be related to each other at all. It's just that there's a tracker, Ballard, who talked about it here once. It looks like he was seriously worried. If you want to know more, you'd better ask Ballard, he's around here somewhere, look for him on the edge of town northeast of the inn.~ /*I've been hearing about strange things from Neverwinter Wood. Of course that might just be completely unrelated.*/
@47 = ~All right, I will do that. Goodbye.~
@48 = ~Okay, but first I would like to ask you another question.~
@49 = ~Don't forget, the Alliance Arms Inn has one of the best selections of imported ale this side of Waterdeep.~
@50 = ~Well, there is Alhelor. He seems to know a lot about werewolves. He also has some special equipment to sell to werewolf hunters. You could talk to him, I suppose. Although... no, nevermind.~
@51 = ~What? You can tell me. I won't repeat anything, I swear.~
@52 = ~One can never feel truly safe when there are werewolves running around.~
@53 = ~I don't suppose so. Could you answer another question?~
@54 = ~Well, I hate to say anything, but there is something a little odd about Alhelor. He just puts me on edge. I doubt it is anything serious. Just my nerves I suspect.~
@55 = ~NP: I suspect you're exaggerating too much. I'll go and talk to Elchelor now.~ /*I suspect you are overly paranoid. I'd better talk to Alhelor now.*/
@56 = ~That's interesting. Maybe I could ask you a few more questions?~
@57 = ~No. I refuse to gossip about a customer. Talk to him and see for yourself.~
@58 = ~I guess I'll go talk to them.~
