@0 = ~Greetings. Blessings of the Earthmother Chauntea and the Treefather Silvanus upon you. I am Nyatar, in the service of Nature.~ [NWNYAT52]
@1 = ~Hello, I am <CHARNAME>. Could I ask some questions?~
@2 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. I have some questions.~
@3 = ~I'm <CHARNAME>. Just shut up and answer my questions.~
@4 = ~Me got questions me want ask.~
@5 = ~Farewell, then.~
@6 = ~I welcome your well-mannered address. Ask what you will, and I shall respond as I am able.~
@7 = ~What is your position here?~
@8 = ~NP: Are there any nature-related places in the downtown area?~ /*Is there a place for nature in the heart of this city?*/
@9 = ~NP: I need to resupply. What can you offer?~ /*I require supplies. What can you offer?*/
@10 = ~I will assist if I can, but mind your tone in the presence of nature. I favor balance in all things, including within those people I must associate with.~
@11 = ~Walk with balance and with nature.~
@12 = ~I see to it that the city does not tip too far from balance; that concerns for natural elements are kept a priority. *Sigh* It's not easy in these times.~
@13 = ~The place of Nature is everywhere. It cannot be bound by walls or notions of property. Even in the heart of Neverwinter she must find purchase. Especially in this time, when the population has been so weakened by the plague. Balance is the first casualty as people lose hope. And I have no small stake in the fate of this city. The plague is not natural. I cannot be elsewhere when such an abomination goes unchecked.~ /*The place of Nature is everywhere. It cannot be bound by walls or notions of property. Even in the heart of Neverwinter she must find purchase.*/
@14 = ~Why are you so sure this plague is not natural?~
@15 = ~You are a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> druid, are you not? I cannot be mistaken. We are kin in the eyes of the Earthmother. You will understand. Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter. It is operated by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It is not clean, it is not compassionate, and it is not right. The animals within are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@16 = ~NP: Caged animals? That's unacceptable. At least not during the plague.~ /*It can't be new. Not during the plague.*/
@17 = ~This zoo seems small next to the plague.~
@18 = ~You... you are a ranger, are you not? I cannot be wrong; I know a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> of the wood when I see one. You will understand. Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter. It is operated by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It is not clean, it is not compassionate, and it is not right. The animals within are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@19 = ~You would not understand. Only a <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> in nature could fully appreciate what needs to be done. How vital my task is.~
@20 = ~I might still be able to help.~
@21 = ~It kills the spirit. Victims rot from within as their very life is drained away... but where does it go? There is actually energy being lost here! In nature, everything that falls away is reborn elsewhere, but this Wailing steals away the very core of a person like a bandit. That is NOT natural.~ /*In nature, everything that falls away is reborn elsewhere, but this Wailing steals away the very core of a person like a bandit. That is NOT natural.*/
@22 = ~It is not new. I was working to have it closed, but the plague has delayed that indefinitely. The officials I spoke with are among the plague dead. It has given the zoo a reprieve. They know the law was turning against them, but now they have time to cover their actions. I fear the animals will simply be killed and made into trophies. All creatures deserve charity. This bear, panther, wolf and lion; all four should be rescued.~ /*I fear the animals will simply be killed and made into trophies. All creatures deserve charity. This bear, panther, wolf and lion; all four should be rescued.*/
@23 = ~What do you know of this hunter?~
@24 = ~What is the purpose of the zoo?~
@25 = ~I will help you free these animals.~
@26 = ~I have no interest in helping.~
@27 = ~I will help.~
@28 = ~I have no interest in this.~
@29 = ~Your attitude is the majority. I was working to have it closed, but the plague has delayed that indefinitely. The officials I spoke with are among the plague dead. It has given the zoo a reprieve. They know the law was turning against them, but now they have time to cover their actions. I fear the animals will simply be killed and made into trophies.

I was working to have it closed, but the plague has delayed that indefinitely. The officials I spoke with are among the plague dead.*/
@30 = ~Perhaps I was too quick to judge. You seem sincere enough. You may be able to understand why this is so important. Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter. It is operated by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It is not clean, it is not compassionate, and it is not right. The animals within are mistreated.~ /*Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter.*/
@31 = ~No, while I appreciate your offer, this would best be left to someone more inclined to understand balance.~
@32 = ~NP: Are there places in the downtown area that are connected to nature?~ /*Is there a place for nature in the heart of this city?*/
@33 = ~Montgomery "Sureshot" Weatherson. His family has been a great advocate of animal rights, but Montgomery abandoned that philosophy when his father died. He gauges his progress as a man by what he has mastered, his family and business, and nature, creature by creature. He is out of balance. Several nobles live vicariously through him. Their influence protects him from what little pressure I have been able to apply thorugh the law.~ /*Several nobles live vicariously through him. Their influence protects him from what little pressure I have been able to apply thorugh the law.*/
@34 = ~They claim they want common people to see the beauty of nature but, in truth, only the families of certain nobles are allowed in. There are humane ways to do such things, but I suspect this zoo is more intended to show their superiority over the creatures held there. For all the care they give to the animals held within, they may as well have simply placed their heads on the walls.~ /*They claim they want common people to see the beauty of nature but, in truth, only the families of certain nobles are allowed in.*/
@35 = ~I was hoping you would say that. Let me give you a few things to help in your task. I have thought long about what is required. This key will grant access to the zoo. My animal companion "found it," and I made copies. Guards may try to stop you, but doors will not. This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.~ /*This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.*/
@36 = ~Please, speak with these animals as I know you can. Lead them to freedom at the large tree before their lives are lost. There is no purpose to their captivity.~

@38 = ~And take this Scented Fetish. It will let you speak to the animals with the skill of a druid or a ranger. Please, lead the animals to the large tree and freedom.~

@40 = ~I understand your reluctance in this troublesome time, but these little things make a diffence too. Please, take this in case you change your mind. This key will grant access to the zoo.

Please, take this in case you change your mind.*/
@41 = ~NP: Glad to hear it. I remember I gave you the key to the zoo and a scroll to cross the plants. Use the scroll on the big tree by the zoo, and all the animals you bring there will be there.~ /*This is a Transport Via Plants scroll. Use it on the large tree near the zoo and any of the animals you lead there will be teleported here.*/
@42 = ~NP: Please think about it again. The animals must not die.~ /*Please step back; the patients need their sleep.*/
@43 = ~Greetings again, . Nature welcomes you. I hope the day has held you in better health than those poor creatures in the Blacklake zoo.~ [NWNYAT53]
@44 = ~What animals? Is there something you need help with?~
@45 = ~There has been progress in freeing the animals.~
@46 = ~Go over what is needed again.~
@47 = ~Many people are falling to plague, but animals suffer as well. They suffer in cages, in a Blacklake district lodge. There is a zoo in Neverwinter. It is operated by a hunter and his "noble" entourage. It is not clean, it is not compassionate, and it is not right.

@49 = ~That is good to know. Truth be told, my animal spies have kept me informed. I have felt it necessary to carefully monitor the creatures involved.~
@50 = ~All the animals were indeed freed, but the deaths suffered among those creatures has given this task a horrible end.~
@51 = ~All the animals are free and safe. A pity about the deaths among their captors. All life deserves a chance... but perhaps that was their chance. I would call the encounter a success, and must reward you accordingly. I am sure you will be pleased. Please, accept this reward with my blessing and that of the Earthmother and Treefather.~ /*All the animals are free and safe. A pity about the deaths among their captors. All life deserves a chance... but perhaps that was their chance.*/

@53 = ~There has been some movement, but not all of the animals are safe. Please, if there is something you can do to help, this is the time.~
@54 = ~NP: They're all dead. You can't call that a successful conclusion, can you? I can't. And here I was hoping for a little ray of light in the midst of this plague. Please leave me alone. I don't want to talk. It's a tragedy.~ /*They are all dead. You can't call this a success, can you? I can't. I was hoping for a bright spot amidst the plague...*/

@56 = ~Some animals escaped, at least. That is something. A little life in this horrible dying time. I'm not completely happy, but it's something. I want to grant you a reward for what was done, but you'll understand that I can't be too generous. This matter was not handled as well as it could have. Accept this reward and be thankful. Our association has been a trying one.~ /*I want to grant you a reward for what was done, but you'll understand that I can't be too generous. This matter was not handled as well as it could have.*/

@58 = ~At least only one of the animals was killed. That can be called a victory of sorts. Amidst everything else, there is a victory for life here. Here, with my blessing. I'm sure you will be pleased. Your service has been quite adequate.~ /*At least only one of the animals was killed. That can be called a victory of sorts. Amidst everything else, there is a victory for life here.*/
@59 = ~Greetings again, . Nature welcomes you. I hope the day has held you in better health than those poor creatures in the Blacklake zoo.~ [NWNYAT53]
@60 = ~The plague still rages, but some small comfort has been given. Animals are no longer caged in that horrible zoo. Thank you for your assistance, . You were invaluable.~ [NWNYAT51] /*The plague still rages, but some small comfort has been given. Animals are no longer caged in that horrible zoo.*/
@61 = ~NP: The plague is no longer rampant and the animals are no longer languishing in that horrible zoo. Thank you for your help, it is invaluable!~ /*The plague still rages, but some small comfort has been given. Animals are no longer caged in that horrible zoo.*/
@62 = ~Everything is dying. people... the animals... There's not much a person can do... is there? Please, leave me be. I have no desire to speak with anyone.~ [NWNYAT50] /*Everything is dying. people... the animals... There's not much a person can do... is there?*/
