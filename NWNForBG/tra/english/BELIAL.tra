@0 = ~Karlat, is that you?... Wait! What do you want of Belial, mortal?~
@1 = ~Speak quickly <PRO_RACE> fool. Your magic protections will not last long in this place. What do you require of the Fire Lord?~
@2 = ~I command you to give me an item of the greatest power!~
@3 = ~I come as the Judge and demand only answers.~
@4 = ~NP: I had already been commanded that way, it was the mortal Karlat Jareg... I gave him a phylactery in which his soul could rest, free from the threat of mortals. I had my reasons for passing it on to him. I don't see any benefit from you. Choose again, but be wiser.~ /*I was commanded so once before, by the mortal Karlat Jhareg... To him I gave a phylactery where his soul could rest, safe from mortal threat.*/
@5 = ~I require the assistance of a magic item!~
@6 = ~NP: Take this and go away.~ /*I'll take that, thank you.*/
@7 = ~You, fleshling? You are the Judge? Then my charade is over for you command me as none other has before...~
@8 = ~You're trapped here too, aren't you...~
@9 = ~Then tell me the tale of the brothers Jhareg...~
@10 = ~Argue your guilt or innocence while you still can...~
@11 = ~What charade do you speak of?~
@12 = ~Were you a witness or a participant in this crime?~
@13 = ~NP: Yes, Judge. I didn't expect Lathander to interfere with my deal with this wizard. Like ghosts and mortals, I am bound to this place... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*Yes, my Judge. I had not bargained on Lathander's intervention in my dealings with the wizard. Like the ghosts and mortals, I am bound unto this place...*/
@14 = ~Tell me more...~
@15 = ~Get to the story.~
@16 = ~NP: Let the brethren tell their own story, Judge. I'll tell you mine... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*You see, it was I who first planted the seed of slaughter in Karlat's mind. He was but a weapon and it was my hand that controlled him.*/
@17 = ~NP: We are all guilty, my judge, and all are innocent, except for one being... It is I. You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*You see, it was I who first planted the seed of slaughter in Karlat's mind. He was but a weapon and it was my hand that controlled him.*/
@18 = ~NP: I am Belial, prince of demons! How could one believe that such a simple spell could summon me? No, I had my own reasons for responding to Karlat Jareg's call, Judge... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*I am Belial, prince of demons! Did you believe that such a simple spell would summon me? No, I answered Karlat Jhareg's call for my own reasons, Judge...*/
@19 = ~NP: Where does the crime begin? Where does it end? Crime is not an event! It's just a thread woven into the fabric... You see, it was I who planted the seeds of murder in Karlat's mind. He was just a tool in my hands, I controlled him.~ /*Where does the crime begin? Where does it end? A crime is not an event! It is a thread that must be followed through the weave...*/
@20 = ~NP: Quintus was the tool of the tool, the slave of the servant. It was he who brought the children to the castle, and Karlat cast a spell that killed them ... It was me, it was I who kept silent about the fact that this murder does not make sense. It was not needed for the Carlat ritual... but I told him otherwise...~ /*It was I, alone, who stayed silent in the knowledge that the slaughter held no meaning. Karlat's ritual did not require it... but I chose to tell him otherwise...*/
@21 = ~Then it was you behind the slaughter!?~
@22 = ~But why did you do this?~
@23 = ~Why are you telling me this so openly?~
@24 = ~Will you give this as your written oath?~
@25 = ~Very well. Quint gathered the children and Karlat killed them... But it was I who told Karlat the deed was required, though I knew it was not.~
@26 = ~I am Belial, Prince of Demons, Lord of Fire, Scourge of the Abyssal Depths... Were you ever fool enough to expect another?~
@27 = ~Thus is the nature of demons, Judge. Why is there needless suffering in the world? Why is there injustice and strife and tyranny? It is because of us...~
@28 = ~NP: First, Lathander bound everyone in this castle and submitted to the will of the judge. Second, how are you going to punish the demon? The abyss is my home, and I yearn for the sea of flame in which I once roamed.~ /*For another, how do you intend to punish a demon? The Abyss is home to me and I long to walk once more upon its sea of flames.*/
@29 = ~If it means an end to my accursed bondage in this place, then I will gladly give it... There, take it and make of it what you will.~
@30 = ~NP: The agreement has been fulfilled. I'm out.~ /*This talk is over. Get out.*/
@31 = ~NP: Charwood: Belial's Tale The demon Belial, Lord of Fire, has been summoned back to Jareg Castle to testify in the case of the Jareg brothers. According to the demon, he deceived Karlat who called him, saying that if the sorcerer wants to become a baelnorn, he needs to kill all the village children. Belial takes great pride in the tragic consequences of his cunning, openly boasting about it. He is not afraid of Justice, as the return to the Abyss will be a triumphant outcome for him. These indications must be carefully considered.~ /*The demon Belial, Lord of Fire, has been re-summoned to Castle Jhareg's haunted halls to present further evidence in the case of the brothers Jhareg. The two lords of Charwood stand accused of an unspeakable crime by the Guardian Spirit on the castle's main floor and she would no doubt be interested in seeing the written oath that Belial has so recently provided.
According to the demon's account, he lied to Karlat, his original summoner, claiming the slaughter of the village children was necessary if the sorcerer was to become a baelnorn. Belial appears quite proud of this tragic subterfuge, flaunting it readily. He does not fear Judgment, as any return to the Abyss will be a triumphal homecoming for him. It would be wise to consider this evidence carefully.*/
@32 = ~Foolish mortal, you have forgotten to cast your protection charm! Belial shall rule!~
@33 = ~NP: Charwood: Belial's Tale A large book was found in the tower of Karlat Jareg, one of the lords of Charwood, who was charged by a guardian spirit from the first floor of the castle. Lord of Fire. The role of the demon in all these events is very suspicious and required further investigation, so a second invocation had to be made. Unfortunately, the summons failed and no substantive evidence could be obtained from the Firelord.~ /*A large book has been discovered in the tower of Karlat Jhareg, one of the two lords of Charwood who currently stand accused by the Guardian Spirit on the castle's main floor. Lighting the nearby candelabra revealed instructions regarding the summoning of the demon Belial, Lord of Fire. A demon's influence in these events seemed suspicious and well worth investigating, so a re-summoning was attempted.
Unfortunately, the summoning was squandered and no viable evidence could be obtained from the Lord of Fire.*/
@34 = ~Does Lathander have sudden need of my services, Lady Guardian?~
@35 = ~<PRO_HESHE> may very well find me guilty, m'lady, but punishing me shall be quite another matter. You hold no power over me, Guardian...~
@36 = ~Ha! Your Judge is a fool, Guardian! The court is closed, then, the case resolved. By Lathander's own decree, we are free to go... Even me!~
@37 = ~No! And be trapped in this place forever!? It cannot be!~
@38 = ~Some of my finest work, might I add. Even now, the Dark Lords ride into battle with the name of Belial, Lord of Fire, on their lips!~
@39 = ~A large book has been discovered in the tower of Karlat Jhareg, one of the two lords of Charwood who currently stand accused by the Guardian Spirit on the castle's main floor. Lighting the nearby candelabra revealed instructions regarding the summoning of the demon Belial, Lord of Fire. A demon's influence in these events seems suspicious and well worth investigating, though a re-summoning is no doubt risky business.~
