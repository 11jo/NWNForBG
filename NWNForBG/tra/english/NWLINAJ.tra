@6 = ~NP: Do you have any tips or suggestions for our searches?~ /*Do you have any advice or suggestions you can give me about my mission?*/
@7 = ~As you wish.~
@8 = ~I guess that is understandable. I have been away from my home and friends for a long time now. I would like to get to know you too.

@11 = ~What are your memories of your home like?~
@12 = ~Indeed. I think we could aid each other greatly. I just ask that you don't make fun of me, since this was such a dark blot on my name. Many years ago, a cleric performed a service for the people of Evereska by uncovering a drow plot to destroy the city. Sehanine Moonbow came and presented the priest with a silver goblet.~ /*Many years ago, a cleric performed a service for the people of Evereska by uncovering a drow plot to destroy the city.

@15 = ~I guess I should be glad to share my daunting task with a friend. We are both adventurers. If I trust you with my life, I should trust you with my troubles.

I found it in a small town called Llork, but then... oh <CHARNAME>, I lost it again!~ /*We are both adventurers. If I trust you with my life, I should trust you with my troubles.

@20 = ~If I find it I'll let you know.~
@21 = ~Just don't let your quest get in the way of mine. You work for me, not the other way around.~
@22 = ~Please, <CHARNAME>, I should not have said so much. We will talk more about this later, but not now.~
@23 = ~I always wanted to be an adventurer, <CHARNAME>. I have a natural curiosity about everything, and I wanted to experience the things I read in books. But I am from Evereska, the home of philosophers, mages, scholars and students of the mysteries. Adventurous souls are few, and they are often looked down upon.

@24 = ~Oh? Who is that?~
@25 = ~NP: It's clear. We'll speak another time.~ /*Sure, another time.*/
@26 = ~My... it's been a long time since someone asked me that question. I came to Sehanine Moonbow when I was very young, which is unusual, since my parents were both mages and followers of the god Corellon. It started when I was sent to Gaedolin Sentristi's School for 'Potentials'. You see, both of my parents were deep into the mysteries, and held positions of respect. It was assumed that I would take after my parents in the magical arts.~ /*My... it's been a long time since someone asked me that question.

@28 = ~But you didn't take after them?~

@30 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@31 = ~I don't know where the cult might be hiding, though I have heard rumors that might lead to where they have struck lately. There are strange things afoot in the Neverwinter Wood. I don't know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling tales of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.~ /*I don't know very much, but apparently there was a ranger in town here that was telling tales of animals savagely attacking anyone in or around the woods.*/

@36 = ~It seems like we're doing alright so far, so I'm not sure what to tell you. Maybe it'd be best if we just kept on doing what we're doing.~
@37 = ~(Sigh) You don't start with the easy questions do you? That is a bit of a difficult question to answer, but I will do my best. I had worked in the Temple of the Full Moon in Evereska for about six years before I left my home. I loved the peacefulness of the temple. But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn't usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know why, but I just didn't have any luck.~ /*But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn't usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time.

@39 = ~You'd better not bring any bad luck my way.~
@40 = ~NP: These dirty, mean, low, SCARY, EVIL... um, sorry. I'm shaking just thinking about them. Most of my problems were related to thieves. To be honest, it was because of the thieves that I left my house. Before I left my home, I worked for six years at the Full Moon Temple. I really liked the peaceful atmosphere of the temple. But even there, failures and jokes of fate burdened my life. Usually it was the little things. More often than not, I just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't even know why, I just got unlucky.~ /*But even there, accidents and tricks of fate made life difficult. It wasn't usually anything big, just me in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know why, but I just didn't have any luck.*/
@41 = ~I have good and bad memories of my home in Evereska. I never fit in too well, mostly because of my... accident-prone nature, I guess you could call it. I still remember falling during a childhood game of Tambaliya and all the children dancing around me chanting "Human, human, Linu is a human." (Sniff) Elven children can be so cruel. I put up with that for 60 years.~ /*I have good and bad memories of my home in Evereska. I never fit in too well, mostly because of my... accident-prone nature, I guess you could call it.*/
@42 = ~There were good times too, right?~
@43 = ~(Snicker) That's, um... terrible Linu.~
@44 = ~I'd have beat some sense into them.~
@45 = ~Do elven children really call each other humans, in a bad way?~
@46 = ~Yes. The thief stole it right out of the temple and managed to sneak out of Evereska, no small accomplishment there.~
@47 = ~It wasn't my fault... well, it was... but I... oh, it was terrible.~
@48 = ~As I said, I found the chalice in the merchant town of Llork. The thief, a halfling, tried to sell it to a Zhent merchant, but when the halfling tried to charge him 500 gold, the Zhent claimed the religious artifact as 'tribute to Bane'. The halfling thief protested, but the mayor of the town is a Zhent as well. Next thing the halfling knew, he was arrested for the murder of an old woman who had spit in the face of a Zhent soldier the day before.~ /*As I said, I found the chalice in the merchant town of Llork.

@49 = ~I know. I berate myself all the time, and beg for Sehanine to blast me into oblivion for failing her so!~
@50 = ~How did you lose it?~
@51 = ~The Silver Chalice of Moonbow! Thank you, <CHARNAME> - I can never repay you for this gift of true friendship. There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.~ /*There is something I have that might be of some use to you. This is the Pendant of the Elf. It has the power to enhance some of your abilities with those of the elven ancestors.*/
@52 = ~Thank you, dear <CHARNAME>. But don't let my concerns interfere with your duty to Aribeth. My problem was self-inflicted, curing the plague is more important.~
@53 = ~Oh, dear <CHARNAME>. You are always so focused on one thing. Don't worry so much, I won't let you down.~
@54 = ~Synth La'neral was a handsome, charismatic, intelligent, adventurous archeologist. He was respected within Evereska and other intellectual circles in places like Waterdeep.

@58 = ~All children of gifted wizards in Evereska are sent to special schools as 'potentials', because they are expected to excel in furthering the art of spellcraft. My ability to get into trouble had already started by that age, but my parents had kept it quiet, thinking I would grow out of it.~ /*All children of gifted wizards in Evereska are sent to special schools as 'potentials', because they are expected to excel in furthering the art of spellcraft.*/
@59 = ~Okay, go on.~
@60 = ~Boy, were they wrong.~
@61 = ~I worked in the core of the city for a while, but most of my time was spent in the slums of the Blacklake district. The slums separate the rich from the rest of the city. Bodies of plague victims lay in the streets, unattended by guards or healers. There were to many sick and I couldn't keep up. Not that I helped much, but I tried to help ease their pain as much as I could.~ /*Bodies of plague victims lay in the streets, unattended by guards or healers. There were to many sick and I couldn't keep up. Not that I helped much, but I tried to help ease their pain as much as I could.*/
@62 = ~Yes. I don't remember what his name was, but he was in Port Llast for a while. It is possible that the townsfolk might know where he is. It may be nothing, but I have a feeling it could be important. Having failed to destroy us with their terrible disease, it would hardly shock me to find out that the cult had struck with a plague of vicious animals.~ /*Yes. I don't remember what his name was, but he was in Port Llast for a while. It is possible that the townsfolk might know where he is. It may be nothing, but I have a feeling it could be important.*/
@63 = ~Is there anything else you know about the cult?~
@64 = ~I understand. We must keep our efforts focused on rooting out those responsible for the Neverwinter plague.~
@65 = ~I have read about some ancient ruins, to the far south of here. What I read of the ruins is that they contain traces of ancient cultures, whose knowledge of magic ran deeper than any living today. I think that magic like the words of power would most likely be associated with the ancient times.~ /*I have read about some ancient ruins, to the far south of here.

@66 = ~Magic?~
@67 = ~It's not always bad luck though. Sometimes I can be a little gullible. That's what got me into trouble and sent away from Evereska. I was collecting tithes one day, when a heavily cloaked figure came begging at the temple. He looked like a starving child, so I took him inside the inner sanctum to get him some food and when I came back, he was gone. There was also something else missing, something very precious to the church.~ /*I was collecting tithes one day, when a heavily cloaked figure came begging at the temple.

@74 = ~The other priests were frightfully mad. Only the head priest was willing to concede that it could have happened to someone else. But, of course, it didn't. It happened to the person that broke the head off the golden statue of Corellon. I didn't know what to do, so I stayed up all night, praying to Sehanine to guide my path. The goddess heard my prayer and just before the first ray of light broke the dark, I was granted a vision.~ /*The other priests were frightfully mad.

@159 = ~I think he had waited for a time when I was wrapped up in something I couldn't get out of. It was his way of protecting me. Synth had a friend who was a mage create a pair of journals. We could write to each other and be in contact everyday. I don't know why, but he never wrote to me about his day or his quest. Instead he would write about his thoughts and philosophies on life and the mysteries. I wish he had written more about where he went.~ /*I don't know why, but he never wrote to me about his day or his quest.

@163 = ~The last entry he wrote, he spent several pages telling me how much he loved me, and that no matter what happened to him, I must go on. I knew something was wrong and I begged him to tell me, but he ignored my pleas. The last thing he wrote was that he could hear them coming again. That was it.~ /*I knew something was wrong and I begged him to tell me, but he ignored my pleas. The last thing he wrote was that he could hear them coming again. That was it.*/

@179 = ~As he began to quietly serenade me, I sat bolt upright in bed and opened my mouth to scream. He jumped toward me, to quiet me, but I didn't know it was him, so I brought my foot up and kicked him in the jaw. He stumbled backwards, out onto the balcony. I leapt up to continue my attack, but when I got to the balcony, I saw his face in the moonlight.

@184 = ~Just whisper my name and I'll wake up fine. That's something I've had to train myself to do. Unfortunately it didn't help Synth.~
@185 = ~He had grabbed the edge of the balcony floor, between the rails, and was trying to swing himself toward the lower terrace. I didn't see his fingers though.~
@186 = ~Tell me you didn't.~
@187 = ~You're just one calamity after another, aren't you?~
@188 = ~I stepped right on his right hand, causing it to slip off the edge. He managed to hang on with his left hand though. Fearing he would die, I called on Sehanine for the strength to save him. I felt power flow into my muscles and I reached over the edge, grabbing his hand. I pulled, heard a loud popping noise, and hauled him over the wall, dislocated shoulder and all.~ /*Fearing he would die, I called on Sehanine for the strength to save him.

@189 = ~At least he survived.~
@190 = ~I'm afraid that's true. It wasn't my fault though, I was trying to help him.~
@191 = ~I don't think he was terribly thankful at first. He just lay on the balcony, trying to hold his shoulder and rub his jaw. I was trying to apologize, but he just kept begging me not to touch him. Finally I got frustrated with his protests and I grabbed his shoulder, popped it back into place, then cast a healing spell on him to relieve the pain.~ /*I don't think he was terribly thankful at first.

@194 = ~I never gave him a chance to think about it. I helped him up, kissed him soundly, then led him into my bedchambers and removed any thought of flight from his mind.~
@195 = ~Good for you!~
@196 = ~You mean you... ?~
@197 = ~I may have troubles with certain things, but I am a good healer. You should know that by now.~
@198 = ~We were very close after that night and we married a year later. Those were the happiest years of my life. I just wish they could have lasted.~ /*We were very close after that night and we married a year later. Those were the happiest years of my life.*/
@199 = ~What do you mean? What happened?~
@200 = ~What? Did you kill him finally?~
@201 = ~I'm sure you can fill in the details without my help.~
@202 = ~I... I can't talk about that right now. The memories are too unpleasant.~
@203 = ~That... that is a cruel thing to say. You have a heart like a rock. I have treated you as a friend; a lesson you should well learn.~
@204 = ~I suppose you won't rest until I tell you about the accident that led to my becoming a cleric of Sehanine. I guess I can tell you, though it was a horrifying experience.~

@206 = ~NP: We'll speak another time.~ /*Me talk about different things.*/
@207 = ~<CHARNAME>, you are my truest friend in the world. I know now that we must work together to accomplish all of our quests.

@210 = ~That's all there is to tell, sweet <CHARNAME>. I shall defend your life with my own until the day that Neverwinter is safe again. Someday fate might guide me to the seed.

You are my guide to restoring the volcanic oak, to rebuild my people.~ /*The goddess has led me to be here with you.

@214 = ~It was just over a month into our training when Gaedolin decided to let us examine some of his collection of magical artifacts. He took us into his vault, the part where the lower powered magic items were stored. We played with them for a while, but I was bored.~ /*He took us into his vault, the part where the lower powered magic items were stored. We played with them for a while, but I was bored.*/

@216 = ~You didn't destroy the place, did you?~
@217 = ~You were bored playing with magic items?~
@218 = ~Bored children with magic items? I should say that's trouble.~
@219 = ~That's not funny. I didn't destroy anything... this time.~
@220 = ~Being from a wizard's home, most of us had seen items like these quite a few times. I was hardly going to be impressed by a wand of magic missiles. I noticed that one of the doors had been left open, so I thought I would have a quick peek inside. I didn't mean to touch anything, but two of the other students came in behind me. One of them asked what I was doing.~ /*Being from a wizard's home, most of us had seen items like these quite a few times. I was hardly going to be impressed by a wand of magic missiles.*/
@221 = ~His voice scared me, causing me to jump into the air, but I didn't land on the floor. I didn't see the rope that was hung to keep people away from this one display. The hole I fell into was a doorway into another plane of existence, or at least that's what they told me later. According to Gaedolin, no person, let alone a child, should have survived the experience.~ /*The hole I fell into was a doorway into another plane of existence, or at least that's what they told me later.

@224 = ~All I know is that my body seemed to expand and contract at a horribly fast rate, like a hyperventilating toad. The feeling seemed to last for hours, but was over in seconds.

@236 = ~I sat on the ground, trembling uncontrollably. Arms enveloped my quaking form and a soft voice whispered words into my ear.~
@237 = ~What did the voice say?~
@238 = ~Who was it?~
@239 = ~Is that all this is? Is this just a way to get me into your bed? You swine!~
@240 = ~I was just joking, Linu. Calm yourself and continue your story.~
@241 = ~I really don't care what you think. Let's get going.~

@243 = ~I can only recall images of journeys and safety, of life and death and of times to come. As the voice spoke, I began to feel very tired and I drifted off to sleep.

@247 = ~The voices were suddenly interrupted by the entrance of my master, who angrily asked why I was taken to the temple of Sehanine. A single word from the woman stopped him cold.~
@248 = ~How did she stop him?~
@249 = ~What did she say?~
@250 = ~All she said was his name. He looked at her with a piercing stare, then his eyes opened in surprise and he sank to his knees. I was confused, having no idea who was standing by my bed.

@252 = ~I already figured that out.~
@253 = ~The goddess came over and pulled the curtain back. She smiled and kissed me on the forehead. "My child," she said, "you have exceeded the boundaries of luck."

@257 = ~Such is my life. Bad and good luck in heaping amounts, like a gift of gold that crushes you under its weight.~
@258 = ~I have dedicated my life to the goddess. She gave me that gift, so I gave everything back to her. There is a task that she wishes me to accomplish and that is why she chose to save my life.~
@259 = ~A task?~
@260 = ~I overheard a few of the words she shared with the high priest, before my master came in the room. But that is a task for me and should not be allowed to interfere with your quest.
