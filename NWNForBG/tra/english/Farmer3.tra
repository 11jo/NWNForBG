@0 = ~MT: Don't you have anything else to do?~ /*There is nothing for you here!*/
@1 = ~MT: I swear I saw a ghost the other day, so now I keep a torch and a good club ready all the time. As long as it stays out of my backyard, I don't care.~ /*Mutamin, the owner of this place, is a retired adventurer himself. Quite wealthy, or so I hear.*/
@2 = ~MT: You'd better go to Pete O'Deal's farm, he has, I'll tell you a secret, a marriageable daughter, a great girl.~ /*Just down the road, Pete O'Deel has a farm with a few head of cattle. A pack of wolves has been killing his cattle almost daily.*/
@3 = ~MT: There is no time to chat - you need to sow one more plot. But I will give you one piece of advice: be careful on the roads. Rogues can take more than just gold from you.~ /*And you can just lend me some gold in return. Why, I'll even let you keep such items, and I'll just keep the gold.*/
@4 = ~MT: If you are heading to Charwood, then it is better to turn back, there are a lot of ghosts there. No one has yet returned from the gloomy forest in my lifetime, as if I'm telling you.~ /*If it does explode, that would be incredibly inconvenient, seeing as I would be caught in the same explosion as you.*/
@5 = ~MT: I am a simple farmer. I do not know anything. And there is no need to trample on my crops.~ /*I don't know anything about that. That's how I got it.*/
