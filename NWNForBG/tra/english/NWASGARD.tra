@0 = ~Who... who are you? What do you want? I'm just a poor old blind man. Don't hurt me, please.~
@1 = ~Don't worry, I won't hurt you.~
@2 = ~Who are you old man? What are you doing here?~
@3 = ~I need to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~Follow me, old man. I'll take you to safety.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~Hmmm... your voice. You don't have a Luskan accent. And I guess if you were a Luskan soldier you'd already have chopped my head off. But if you aren't a Luskan soldier, I can only wonder what brings you here.~ /*Hmmm... your voice. You don't have a Luskan accent. And I guess if you were a Luskan soldier you'd already have chopped my head off.*/
@7 = ~My name is Asgard. Asgard the Aged, the children call me. Or sometimes Asgard Eagle-Eyes if they want to be mean. At least, the children used to call me that. No children left here now, thanks to those Luskan butchers. I got as many of them out of the city as I could, but I couldn't save them all.~ /*At least, the children used to call me that. No children left here now, thanks to those Luskan butchers. I got as many of them out of the city as I could, but I couldn't save them all.*/
@8 = ~How did a blind man help the children leave the city?~
@9 = ~Since you don't seem like you're interested in killing me, I'll be happy to answer your questions for you.~
@10 = ~How have you avoided capture by the Luskan army?~
@11 = ~Follow you? That would be a neat trick, considering I'm blind as a stone! Besides, I'm not leaving. A small thing like an invading army isn't enough to make me leave my home.~ /*Besides, I'm not leaving. A small thing like an invading army isn't enough to make me leave my home.*/
@12 = ~Yes, leave an old, blind man in peace. I only wish the Luskan army would do the same for this city.~
@13 = ~You might look at me and see just a blind, helpless old man. But if that's the case you're getting no more use out of your eyes than I do of mine.~
@14 = ~What are you talking about?~
@15 = ~Long ago, before my hair grew white and my eyes grew black, I was a smuggler here in Neverwinter. Back then I wasn't known as Asgard the Aged. Just Asgard, I was... Just Asgard...~
@16 = ~Never heard of you.~
@17 = ~That just proves how good I was. I knew every secret way into or out of the city, and even blind I can still find most of them. That's how I was able to help the children escape when the Luskan army first came. And that's how I've avoided capture by the Luskan soldiers so far. Whenever I heard them lumbering up my front steps to search the building I just slipped away out my back door.~ /*That just proves how good I was. I knew every secret way into or out of the city, and even blind I can still find most of them. That's how I was able to help the children escape when the Luskan army first came.*/
@18 = ~Back door? This place doesn't have a back door.~
@19 = ~NP: Yes, there is. A secret door. Unfortunately, it leads directly to where the Luskan High Command is camped. Actually, it's kind of funny. They've got whole hordes of archers guarding the place to protect their high command, and some old blind smuggler can get in there whenever he wants.~ /*It's kind of funny, really. They built a huge iron gate guarded by a score of archers to protect their high commanders, and an old, blind smuggler's got himself a secret, unguarded way in.*/
@20 = ~Where can I find this back door?~
@21 = ~NP: It's over there in the center of the room. Just open the hatch. It's not that hard to find if you know what you're looking for. You can use it if you want. But please don't tell anyone about it. If Neverwinter survives this war, I want to keep my little secret. You never know when or what might come in handy.~ /*But please, don't go spreading news of it all about. If Neverwinter survives this war, I want to keep my little secret. You never know when it might come in handy.*/
@22 = ~Thanks for the info! I'm going to use it to find Aribeth and Maugrim!~
@23 = ~Well, then. I hope you kill them when you find them. After the slaughter they brought down on this city, they deserve no less. As for me, I think I'll stay here. I doubt a blind man would be much help on your expedition.~ /*Well, then. I hope you kill them when you find them. After the slaughter they brought down on this city, they deserve no less.*/
