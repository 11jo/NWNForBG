@1 = ~The sorcerer has kept you prisoner here?~
@2 = ~Stand back! I'll have no tricks out of you, dryad!~
@3 = ~Calm down. I am here to free you.~
@4 = ~Sadly, yes. This servant wandered the strange city after fleeing the horrid battle... I did not know where to turn and longed so for my oak. Meldanen found me and brought me to this place. He meant to... to hurt me and make a cure for a great sickness. I did only what I could, and charmed him.~ /*Meldanen found me and brought me to this place. He meant to... to hurt me and make a cure for a great sickness. I did only what I could, and charmed him.*/
@5 = ~NP: I won't harm you, and I won't use my charms on you, I swear! With Meldanen, it brought me nothing but grief! Please just let me go!~ /*I mean you no harm, <PRO_RACE> one, and shall not use my glamors to charm you, I swear it! It has brought me no end of grief with Meldanen! Please just let me go!*/
@6 = ~You charmed the sorcerer? Is that how you ended up imprisoned here?~
@7 = ~And how would you reward me if I let you go?~
@8 = ~I ask that you first come to Aribeth and help cure the plague.~
@9 = ~Forget it! I'll just take what is needed... off your corpse!~
@10 = ~Oh! Blessed are you, kind <PRO_RACE> one! I have been lost and so frightened since that terrible battle! I fled into the streets, but everything was so strange here! Meldanen found me and brought me to this place. He meant to... to hurt me and make a cure for a great sickness. I did only what I could, and charmed him.~ /*Meldanen found me and brought me to this place. He meant to... to hurt me and make a cure for a great sickness. I did only what I could, and charmed him.*/
@11 = ~'Twas almost worse, however, to bear his obsession. Please release me, <PRO_RACE> friend! I have been away from my oak far too long!~
@12 = ~How have you survived away from your oak this long?~
@13 = ~Stay back! I'll not be charmed by you!~
@14 = ~A great wizard of the humans came to my grove and said that part of my essence would aid in curing a great sickness amongst his people. He did not know what part of my essence, however, and asked me to travel to this strange place so it could be discovered. I have no wish for so many to perish, so I agreed, and the wizard placed a spell upon me that bid me to live. Oh, but I miss my oak so, <PRO_RACE> friend! Will you not release me?~ /*I have no wish for so many to perish, so I agreed, and the wizard placed a spell upon me that bid me to live. Oh, but I miss my oak so, <PRO_RACE> friend! Will you not release me?*/
@15 = ~Alas, I have nothing with which to reward you. I am so far, so very far away from my oak and I have no wealth. I can only plead that you allow me to leave!~
@16 = ~That's all right. I could use a slave of my own.~
@17 = ~No reward? Then you die.~
@18 = ~You need not worry. All you have to do is take a lock of my hair to your Lady Aribeth. I give it gladly, <PRO_RACE> one. I had hoped I could do more, but I am very weak now. It saddens me to see the sickness in your people... but now that you have my hair I am no longer really needed here. May this servant of the oak be allowed to leave? I miss my tree so...~ /*You need not worry. All you have to do is take a lock of my hair to your Lady Aribeth. I give it gladly, <PRO_RACE> one. I had hoped I could do more, but I am very weak now.*/
@19 = ~Would you be able to find your way home on your own?~
@20 = ~You may get lost in the city. I'll take you to someone who can help.~
@21 = ~No, you can't go anywhere. I could use a good slave.~
@22 = ~NP: Now I know that I need a piece of your hair. Die, creature.~ /*I got what I needed. Now you die, creature.*/
@23 = ~No, no! Great oak defend your servant!!~
@24 = ~NP: No, just not that! I can't take it! The great oak will protect me.~ /*No, no more! I cannot bear it! Great oak preserve me, I must flee!!*/
@25 = ~Yes... yes, I believe I could. I need only reach the nearest tree... the wizard who came to my grove said any tree would return me home.~
@26 = ~Then you are free to go. The way behind me is clear.~
@27 = ~Perhaps you should accompany me. It would be safer that way.~
@28 = ~You are most kind to offer, <PRO_RACE> one, but I need only reach the nearest tree. The wizard who came to my grove said a single tree would return me home. I shall never forget you! If we meet again, I pray that I shall be able to reward you properly! Farewell!~ /*You are most kind to offer, <PRO_RACE> one, but I need only reach the nearest tree.

@31 = ~NP: I beg you, set the unfortunate maid of the oak free! You are kind<RACE> Or have you come to torment me too?~ [NWDRYAD9] /*Oh, please let this servant of the oak be free at last! Are you kind, <PRO_RACE> one, or but another captor come to torment me?*/
