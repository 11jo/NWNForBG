@0 = ~You are here because Neurik sent you? You are here because of the trial?~ [ROLGAN50]
@1 = ~MT: Court? What court?~ /*Where is your husband?*/
@2 = ~Yes, I am to defend you. Tell me what happened.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~I am called a murderer and now I await judgment. Neurik can explain it better. I am unfamiliar with the ways of justice among your kind.~
@5 = ~MT: Griff suggested that I play cards. I did not want to reject this gesture of friendship, I accepted the invitation and the drinks that he readily offered me. I began to feel strange, my mind clouded more than ale usually does. I made stupid bets and lost a few family heirlooms that mean a lot to my tribe - like religious items.~ /*I began to feel strange, my mind was clouded by more than just ale. I gambled foolishly, and lost several personal heirlooms of great religious significance to my tribe.*/
@6 = ~Go on.~
@7 = ~You should never wager something you cannot afford to lose.~
@8 = ~Go if you wish. I must stay here, though my heart aches to return to my tribe. When the trial is over, Uthgar willing, I will be allowed to return to my home.~
@9 = ~MT: I returned to my tribe in disgrace. Wanda, my wife, said that I should go back and talk to Griff, reconcile and beg him to return our artifacts of our tribe in exchange for a promise to pay him even more gold later. But Griff attacked me before I could offer him anything. I killed him to save my life. I had no other choice!~ /*I returned to my tribe in shame. Vanda, my wife, told me to go back and speak to Griff, to humble myself and beg him to return our religious heirlooms in exchange for the promise of much gold later on.*/
@10 = ~I know this, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I was not in my right mind. Something strange had taken hold of my thoughts.~
@11 = ~MT: I fled to this temple, barely avoiding a mob of soldiers who wanted to kill me to avenge Griff. Newrick gave me refuge, but only on the condition that I consent to a trial that would decide my fate.~ /*Neurik gave me sanctuary but only if I vowed to submit to a trial to determine my fate.*/
@12 = ~Can you tell me anything else?~
@13 = ~MT: We Utgardts are different from you. Our customs and traditions may seem strange to you. We are called savages, drunkards and thieves. This is how we appear to the Lords' Alliance, and they call me a murderer just because I defended myself. We Black Lion Tribe are noble people. I am not a pagan savage, not a vicious murderer. I pray to Utgar that you can understand this and help me.~ /*We Uthgardt are different than you. Our ways and customs may seem strange. They call us savages and pagans and drunks and thieves. This is how the Lords' Alliance sees us, and that is why I am called a murderer for defending myself.*/
@14 = ~I'll do what I can.~
@15 = ~It is good to taste the open air once more. Freedom is sweet upon my tongue. I thank Uthgar for the verdict that cleansed the word murderer from my name.~ [ROLGAN51]
@16 = ~MT: I thank you,<LADYLORD> . You are a true friend of the people of Utgardt, and the Black Lion tribe will pronounce your name with reverence.~ [ROLGAN52] /*And I thank you, <PRO_LADYLORD> <CHARNAME>. You are a true friend of the Uthgardt people, and the Black Lion Tribe speaks your name with reverence.*/
@17 = ~MT: Yes,<LADYLORD> . What would you like to know?~ /*Yes, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. What do you wish to know?*/
@18 = ~Tell us what happened that night, Rolgan.~
@19 = ~What was your state of mind that night, Rolgan? Were you thinking clearly?~
@20 = ~Do you think the only reason you are here is because you are an Uthgardt?~
@21 = ~I have no more questions for this witness.~
@22 = ~My wife convinced me to go speak with Griff, to beg him to return the heirlooms to me. But when I approached Griff, he attacked as soon as he saw me. I had no choice but to defend myself.~
@23 = ~No, my mind was hazy with the fog from the many cups I had consumed. It was as if I was in a dream, nothing seemed real. I hardly even realized what was happening until it was too late and Griff was dead.~
@24 = ~The jury may think this is merely an excuse to justify what you have done, Rolgan.~
@25 = ~MT: I think the Lords' Union needs to somehow calm down their own soldiers. And if it means sacrificing someone from Utgardt, they won't hesitate to do just that. My culture and faith are judged here, not my actions.~ /*I believe the Lords' Alliance must appease their own soldiers. If an innocent Uthgardt must be sacrificed for that end, they would not hesitate to do so.*/
@26 = ~That is not my intent. I know I must be responsible for my own actions, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. But that night I was not thinking rationally. When Griff attacked, my instincts took over and I defended myself. I am no murderer, and I hope the court can understand that.~
@27 = ~I am a true Uthgardt warrior of the Black Lion tribe! I have earned the honor and respect of all my people!~
@28 = ~I would be shamed by my actions. I *am* shamed by my actions.~
