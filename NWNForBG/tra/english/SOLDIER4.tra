@0 = ~MT: I ask you to leave immediately! This is a barracks, not a museum for tourists!~ /*I will begin my search for the Waterdhavian creatures at once!*/
@1 = ~Who you follow?~
@2 = ~MT: If these are barracks, then where are the soldiers?~ /*If me find it me let you know.*/
@3 = ~MT: Okay, I'm leaving now.~ /*Fine, I'll go.*/
@4 = ~MT: I'm a mercenary hired by the mayor of this city. His name is Kendrak and he's in the building opposite. Now leave the room.~ /*I've a little gold. I suppose you could take it. Just go now, all right?*/
@5 = ~MT: Since you are a mercenary, can I hire you?~ /*You're a mercenary. That mean you're for hire?*/
@6 = ~MT: Isn't it clear? At their posts, of course. However, some are now in the city hall - this is the building opposite. Now leave the room.~ /*I don't get good luck. I get stuck in a zombie-filled city with a broken wagon and the scorn of my wife.*/
@7 = ~MT: I'm already hired. Leave the room, I won't repeat it a third time.~ /*Me sorry. Me got lost. You say that again?*/
@8 = ~MT: Go your own way. You don't belong here.~ /*Just wait here a while longer.*/
