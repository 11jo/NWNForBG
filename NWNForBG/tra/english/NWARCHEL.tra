@0 = ~Greetings, I am Master Ford, head archeologist of Neverwinter. Lord Nasher mentioned someone might be coming to investigate the Source Stone. <CHARNAME>, isn't it?~ [ARCHEL057]
@1 = ~NP: I must say, the Source Stone is truly an amazing find. Amazing. I have been an archaeologist for almost half a century and have never seen anything like it. I've been trying to get some secrets from Hadralyn, the lizard-like creature that Lord Nasher keeps imprisoned in the dungeon. However, she doesn't seem to trust me.~ /*I tried to pry some of its secrets from Haedraline - the lizard creature Lord Nasher has imprisoned in the dungeons. But she didn't seem to trust me.*/
@2 = ~I need to see the Source Stone.~
@3 = ~I would like to ask you some questions.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~NP: Er... yes. Yes, sure. Why should only I have the right to see him? He doesn't belong to me, after all. Come check it out if you want. However, I doubt that it will bring us much benefit. There is no way to reveal the secrets of this stone. I thought the Words of Power could help us, but so far they haven't done anything.~ /*I doubt it will do you much good, however. There doesn't seem to be any way to unlock the secrets of the stone. I thought the Words of Power might be the key, but they haven't done anything so far.*/
@6 = ~Don't you think it might be dangerous to unlock the secrets of the Source Stone?~
@7 = ~How come nobody noticed this stone down here before?~
@8 = ~NP: Of course, I am happy to share my knowledge with you. It seems to me that my theories regarding the mysteries of the Source Stone are of absolutely no interest to my students. Esmeralda doesn't think we should mess with the Source Stone at all. And Klet has no less ignorance than self-confidence. I gave him some ancient texts to read so he wouldn't bother me.~ /*Esmerelda thinks we shouldn't be tampering with the Source Stone. And Cletus is as ignorant as he is arrogant. I gave him some old texts to read to keep him out of my hair.*/
@9 = ~Who are you again?~
@10 = ~What do you know about the Source Stone?~
@11 = ~Where are the Words of Power?~
@12 = ~NP: You can contact me at any time. I'm always happy to discuss the Source Stone.~ /*Feel free to speak to me again anytime, <CHARNAME>. I'm always eager to discuss the Source Stone.*/
@13 = ~NP: You sound like my assistant Esmeralda. She does not want to touch the stone at all. And I understand very well what I'm risking. And yet... I can't leave this stone alone. During the day it consumes all my thoughts, and at night it haunts my dreams. He calls to me... he *wants* me to reveal his secrets!~ /*And yet... I cannot leave the stone alone. When awake it consumes my thoughts and at night it haunts my dreams. It calls to me... it *wants* me to unravel the mysteries contained within!*/
@14 = ~NP: You feel the call of the ancient evil that lives in this stone. Be careful, otherwise it will swallow you.~ /*You feel the call of the ancient evil that dwells within the stone, Master Ford. Beware lest it consume you.*/
@15 = ~NP: We started searching the dungeons of Nevers Castle only after this lizard-like creature Hadralin told us about the existence of the Source Stone. We easily found the secret door. It was even too easy, considering that no one had ever noticed her before. It's like the Source Stone itself *wanted* to be discovered.~ /*We found the secret door easily enough, then. It was almost too easy, considering nobody ever noticed it before. It's almost like the Source Stone itself *wants* to be found now.*/
@16 = ~NP: I am Master Ford, Neverwinter's chief expert on ancient artefacts and historical treasures. In other words, an archaeologist. When the Source Stone was discovered here in Nevers Castle, Lord Nasher made the wise decision of appointing me to investigate its mysteries. What I have found is simply amazing!~ /*When the Source Stone was discovered here beneath Castle Never, Lord Nasher wisely appointed me to investigate its secrets. What I have uncovered so far has been fascinating!*/
@17 = ~NP: This stone radiates a magical heat that would be enough to heat an entire city even in such a cold climate as ours. At the same time, this heat is so soft that you can literally come up and touch the stone itself. That's all we know for sure. However, I have a few theories based on my own observations and extensive research on ancient manuscripts.~ /*The stone radiates a magical heat strong enough to keep the entire city warm even in this chill climate, yet gentle enough that you can actually go right up and touch the stone itself.*/
@18 = ~Tell me your theories.~
@19 = ~I'm not interested in your theories.~
@20 = ~NP: They are next to the Source Stone. I thought they could help unlock the secrets of the stone, but they don't work. Probably something is missing. The Source Stone is surrounded by four pedestals. I put on them by the Word of Power. But we only have three Words.~ /*They're with the Source Stone. I thought they might be the key to unlocking it's secrets, but they didn't work. Perhaps something is missing.*/
@21 = ~NP: My research shows that beneath this luminous crystalline surface lies an entire extraplanar world, a link between many parallel worlds, a conduit that connects the various planes and universes to each other. And besides, there is something alive inside the Source Stone. Of this I am sure. A powerful life force emanates from it, possibly from the inhabitants of this extraplanar world.~ /*My research indicates that there is an entire extra-planar realm within its gleaming crystalline surface; a nexus of many parallel worlds, a conduit linking alternate planes and universes with each other.*/
@22 = ~Ah, well. Perhaps some other time, then. Is there something else you need?~
@23 = ~I suspect there is a fourth Word that is necessary to unlock the Source Stone. Four pedestals, four Words of Power. Just a theory, of course, but a fairly logical conclusion.~
@24 = ~That lizard creature Haedraline could probably tell you more, if she wanted to. But when I tried to speak to her she refused to answer my questions. I don't think she trusts me.~
@25 = ~Back again, <CHARNAME>? Is there something I can do for you?~ [ARCHEL056]
