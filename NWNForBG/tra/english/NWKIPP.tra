@0 = ~If you're going onto the Peninsula, keep your head up. There's been a prison break and the place is crawling with trouble.~
@1 = ~How did they escape?~
@2 = ~Where's this prison?~
@3 = ~Are any areas still safe?~
@4 = ~Does the militia have a plan of attack?~
@5 = ~Thanks for the warning.~
@6 = ~Rumor is that Captain Alaefin, the Head Gaoler, set them free. Makes no sense to me - he was a good man and ran a tight ship...~
@7 = ~Southwest of here, at the top of the hill. It commands a great view of the harbor... not that the prisoners ever got to see it.~
@8 = ~NP: Sedos Sebil is in charge of the operation. The prisoners gave her a lot of trouble, but she managed to defend the headquarters. It's in the center of the district, northeast of here.~ /*Sedos Sebile is the one in charge of the operation. The prisoners have her pretty much penned-in, but she's managed to secure a headquarters to the southeast.*/
@9 = ~For now everyone's just trying to figure out what's going on. Someone's going to have to go into that prison though, and get to the bottom of it.~
@10 = ~If you want to thank me, go talk to Sedos Sebile at headquarters. We could definitely use your help cleaning up the Head Gaoler's mess...~

@12 = ~Phew, it's been a hell of a day. I'm just glad the prison break's been handled and dealt with.~
@13 = ~Any good stores in the district?~
@14 = ~Where can I find some healing around here?~
@15 = ~NP: Okay, gatekeeper, I'll go.~ /*All right, all right, I'm going.*/
@16 = ~Look, people feel uncomfortable enough just living around that prison, let alone tossing their money around near it. This place is a shopkeeper's nightmare, all right?~
@17 = ~One of those new Helmites was performing his blessings somewhere to the southwest before all hell broke loose. Maybe he's still there now.~
@18 = ~All right, then. Stay out of trouble.~
