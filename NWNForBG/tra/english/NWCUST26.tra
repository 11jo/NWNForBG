@0 = ~This camp is a mess! Uthgardt savages up on the plateau and morons wandering the streets.~
@1 = ~Hey, the camp is safe. No need to wave your weapons about here. Save that for the battle front.~
@2 = ~Looks like you're ready to head out in search of the traitor Aribeth - you're armed and everything!~
@3 = ~Hello there, miss. What's a pretty gal like you doing in this stinkhole of a camp?~
@4 = ~You look like a take charge kind of guy. You here to search for those Words of Power I heard about?~
@5 = ~You must be one of those mercenaries Gend has hired to search for the Words of Power. I wish you luck.~
@6 = ~I'm sorry, I can't talk right now. I've got to get my stuff ready - I'm shipping out to the front tomorrow.~
@7 = ~I know we need all the help we can get, but I don't trust them Uthgardt up on the plateau.~
@8 = ~Nothing like a pretty lady to remind us soldiers what we're fighting for before we ship off to the front.~
@9 = ~Great - another gold grabbing mercenary here to bleed Gend's coffers dry.~
