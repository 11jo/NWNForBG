@0 = ~What manner of slave are you, that does not cast down <HISHER> eyes in my presence! (hiss) I could have you flayed for this!~
@1 = ~Do you not recognize me? I am Morag, First Daughter of the Queen and heir to the throne! (hiss) How dare you approach me?~
@2 = ~I meant no offense, Mistress. I only wanted to ask you some questions.~
@3 = ~I bow to no one! I am no slave!~
@4 = ~Die, Morag!~
@5 = ~I could have your tongue removed for daring to speak to me, slave. (hiss) But your brazen courage amuses me. It is rare for a slave to show such bravery. I shall answer your questions, creature, though if you displease me your life shall be forfeit. (hiss) What is it you wish to know, slave?~ /*I could have your tongue removed for daring to speak to me, slave. (hiss) But your brazen courage amuses me. It is rare for a slave to show such bravery.*/
@6 = ~What is this place?~
@7 = ~How can we understand each other?~
@8 = ~I want to know more about you, Morag.~
@9 = ~Do you know anything about the Words of Power?~
@10 = ~Your mistress should have removed your tongue for such defiance! (hiss) But wait... There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve? Your clothes and appearance are unknown to me. (hiss) You are no slave! Who are you, creature?~ /*There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve?*/
@11 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I have come from the far distant future.~

@13 = ~Guards! Protect me from this creature!~
@14 = ~This is a temple to the glory of the Creator Race! (hiss) The power and might of our people shall be housed within the heart of these walls for all eternity! As a slave you need not understand more than that. (hiss) It is the will of your mistresses that you build this temple, and you will bow down to that will.~ /*As a slave you need not understand more than that. (hiss) It is the will of your mistresses that you build this temple, and you will bow down to that will.*/
@15 = ~Has your mistress taught you nothing? (hiss) The translation amulet I wear gives you an understanding of my words. (hiss) If not for the amulets we would have no use for your kind. It is the only way we can make our servants and slaves bow down to our orders.~ /*(hiss) If not for the amulets we would have no use for your kind. It is the only way we can make our servants and slaves bow down to our orders.*/
@16 = ~I will not discuss my royal person with a mere slave. (hiss) The intrigue and political machinations of court would be lost on a lowly creature like you in any case. Poison slipped into a mother's cup, an assassin's blade twisted in the belly of an elder sister, an ally betrayed by a false rumor, an infant sibling smothered in his sleep... (hiss) What could a slave know of the motivation behind such things?~ /*Poison slipped into a mother's cup, an assassin's blade twisted in the belly of an elder sister, an ally betrayed by a false rumor, an infant sibling smothered in his sleep...

@17 = ~How dare you speak the name of our most sacred relics? (hiss) I could have your entrails torn from your body for profaning the holy Words, slave!

(hiss) I could have your entrails torn from your body for profaning the holy Words, slave!*/
@18 = ~My actions transcend mere life and death! I am of royal blood and I seek the immortality of the throne! (hiss) But your life is void of ambition. You are a slave. Your only concern is to bow to the will of your mistress.~
@19 = ~There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve? Your clothes and appearance are unknown to me. (hiss) You are no slave! Who are you, creature?~ /*There is something strange about you, creature. Where is your collar? (hiss) Why is your forehead not branded with the mark of the house you serve?*/
@20 = ~Of course, the time sink! (hiss) This is not the world you know, creature. The secrets of the Creator Race are not yours for the taking. Guards! Slay this creature! (hiss) It must not escape back to its own time!~ /*Of course, the time sink! (hiss) This is not the world you know, creature. The secrets of the Creator Race are not yours for the taking.*/
@21 = ~You are arrogant, when you should tremble before the terrible power of the Creator Race. (hiss) How can this be? Unless...~
