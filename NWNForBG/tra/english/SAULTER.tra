@0 = ~Please, good <PRO_SIRMAAM>, can you help? We have lost family to the plague, and escaped convicts in the Peninsula district prevent us from even mourning in our own homes.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~What can I do to be of assistance?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~I... I don't know what someone like me could tell you. All I know is that none of us can go home. The guards do nothing... The Peninsula is unimportant with the plague taking a larger toll.~
@5 = ~Bah! I've no interest in you.~
@6 = ~MT: I... I don't know if you can or not. I don't know what's wrong there. I only know that if we try to return to our homes, we will be killed. If there's anything you can do to help... please, I beg you... help us.~ /*I... I don't know if you can or not. I'm not sure what has gone wrong in there. I just know is that if we try to go back to our homes, we'll be killed.*/
@7 = ~Goodbye, I guess. Please, if you have a chance, can you please look into the trouble in the Peninsula? We have no one else to turn to.~
@8 = ~Please... we've nobody left to turn to. The guards won't help... don't just walk away. The Peninsula... our homes... it's all we've got.~
@9 = ~I hate this. Someone should lay down the law.~
@10 = ~Glad that somebody was willing to take those thieves to the woodshed. I gotta thank you. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna get back to work in there.~
