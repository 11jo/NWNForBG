@0 = ~Speak what ye will, friend. I will answer.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I will answer, though I am a newcomer too. Granting blessings in this time of plague has not left much time for exploration.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Have you collected a lot of charitable donations?~
@8 = ~As you will. Would you like a blessing as you go?~
@9 = ~Please. I'm sure it will help.~
@10 = ~No, thanks.~
@11 = ~You keep your useless blessing thing!~
@12 = ~Hmm... I have only just acquainted myself with the city, but I will assist you if I can.~
@13 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@14 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@15 = ~The Wailing pulls at the soul, spiritually tearing a victim apart from within. The blessings I give are small comfort, but comfort nonetheless.~
@16 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@17 = ~I want to ask something else.~ 
@18 = ~No, not really. Of course, I busy myself with concern for the plagued, and do not worry about petty scandal. Don't waste your time following conjecture. You should be more concerned about your spiritual well-being.~ 
@19 = ~I have... acquired some measure of gold from the generous. What business do you have asking me about it?~
@20 = ~You give me gold or I'll kill you and claim you were stealing it!~
@21 = ~I was merely curious. Let's go back to some other questions.~
@22 = ~No, I have nothing. Someone else has already bilked me of anything I might have had, so you may as well just ask your questions and leave.~
@23 = ~There are several districts dividing the city. The division has apparently slowed the plague, but it divides people as well. I believe the different regions are the Beggar's Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, and the City Core.~ 
@24 = ~Talk about the City Core.~
@25 = ~Talk about the Beggar's Nest.~
@26 = ~Talk about the Docks district.~
@27 = ~Talk about the Blacklake district.~
@28 = ~Talk about the Peninsula.~
@29 = ~I know little of these things. I need only my blessings. Still, I believe there are a few establishments that have what you want.~
@30 = ~The blessings of we Helmites upon you. May it deliver you beyond the plague.~
@31 = ~Most are foolish sorcery, and none have proven effective. We Helmites under Desther are certain that only our blessings will deliver Neverwinter. People are reluctant at first, but the more the plague strikes at them, the more they abandon such things and seek what we offer.~ 
@32 = ~Don't you want the other cure attempts to work?~
@33 = ~Everyone seeks the end of the plague. We under Desther merely believe that our methods will bring the swiftest resolution. In the end, I think people will look back and realize the importance of the role we played, even if they cannot see it now.~ 
@34 = ~As you will. Good luck to you.~
@35 = ~W-what? I am a Helmite in service to Desther! Do you know what you risk by threatening me?!~
@36 = ~I serve Aribeth. She will believe me, not you! Do you want this to get ugly?!~
@37 = ~You are right. I'm sorry. Let us forget this.~
@38 = ~Ah, the spiritual and governmental center. We Helmites have established a small temple here, with Desther as our guide. We are not far from Castle Never, and serve as advisors in all the major institutions. Not all heed our words, but they will in time. There are many shops around the outer District edge as well, though I haven't seen what they hold. I haven't had the time.~ 
@39 = ~Is your temple accesible? I may need clerical services.~
@40 = ~Ah, normally we of the faithful would not object to showing you around, but I fear that our temple is currently closed to the public. You see... ah... Although we treat the sick without hesitation, we can't risk contaminating our blessing pools. We must keep the temple secure.~ 
@41 = ~How long has the temple been closed?~
@42 = ~Well, I accompanied Desther from Helm's Hold shortly after the plague began. He wisely decided to close it soon after we arrived. It is a shame, but necessary. Most of the Helmites that were here previously fell to the plague. All that remain now are we that arrived with Desther.~ 
@43 = ~Can I ask you about Helm's Hold?~
@44 = ~Oh, I am not an authority on the place. I mean, I am a Helmite, of course, but my time in the Hold was limited. Besides, it is days away and hardly worth considering. There is so much here that deserves our attention. Do you require anything else?~ 
@45 = ~The Beggar's Nest? Our blessings are a comfort, but have been unable to lessen the impact of the Wailing in the district. It was thought the plague could be contained there, but even as we try to calm people, the Wailing follows soon after.~ 
@46 = ~Now I fear there is an unforseen threat of undead in the District. Leave it to the Helmites, my friend. Do not endanger yourself there.~
@47 = ~Shouldn't all help be welcome?~
@48 = ~I have heard that the undead that were roaming the area are calmed now. Not that people should endanger themselves facing such things...~
@49 = ~Certainly, but in the proper perspective. The plague will fall not to brute force, but to the growth of hope within the people. The blessings will accomplish this. Other actions can certainly follow, but care must be taken not to do more harm than good. We Helmites will do what is necessary. Our blessings will deliver the city. You will see.~ 
@50 = ~The Docks are a haven for lawlessness, even in this otherwise dark time. Thankfully my brethren have been mostly left to do their good work.~
@51 = ~There has also been much hoarding of gold. Muggings are rampant. I hope it does not harm the spirit of the people further. I would avoid the Docks, friend. Let we Helmites administer our blessings and calm the situation in our gentle way.~ 
@52 = ~I hear, however, that the area is quite calm now. I hope no one was foolishly put at risk by rash action.~
@53 = ~Blacklake is the home of the nobility, a group that I am sorry to say has not borne the weight of these times in a distinguished manner.~
@54 = ~It is possible they are even hoarding resources meant for the poorer Districts. Hopefully no one inflames the situation.~
@55 = ~They hoarded resources away from the poorer of Neverwinter's citizens. Someone has, however, put a stop to it. I'm not sure I approve, as the potential for loss of life was high, but I suppose these things must be done.~ 
@56 = ~The Peninsula is where the prison is located. Try as we might, we Helmites have not been allowed much access within. Hopefully my brethren in the area have continued their blessings and the spirit of that has found a way within to some degree. Especially now, as I have heard that contact with the great fortress has been sporadic. The proper authorities will need time to sort things out.~ 
@57 = ~The Peninsula is where the prison is located. Try as we might, we Helmites have not been allowed much access within. Perhaps we could have prevented the events that befell the place. The loss of so many is a great tragedy. I hope no further rash action is taken. The gentle blessings of we Helmites should be allowed to take precedence. Spirits must be healed.~
@58 = ~I have seen a number of characters enter the Moonstone Mask in the central west. I gather they cater to the stealthy. Not that I truly know anything of the place. I merely mention it as a courtesy. Better you avoid it, I'm sure. I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southeast, but I would avoid it.~ 
@59 = ~Are you a servant of nature? There is a Druid Tree in the City Core, in the southwest of the district, though I am unfamiliar with them. I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southeast, but I would avoid it.~ 
@60 = ~Our Helmite Temple is closed while we continue our blessings. The Temple of Tyr in the City Core upper square west will assist you. I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southeast, but I would avoid it.~ 
@61 = ~If you know of arcane magic, the Cloak Tower may assist you. It is just outside Castle Never. I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southeast, but I would avoid it.~
@62 = ~If you are a master of weapons, the Shining Knight Arms and Armor in the southeast City Core seem to be well-stocked. I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southeast, but I would avoid it.~
@63 = ~You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to the Shining Knight Arms and Armor, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Thieves are welcome in the Moonstone Mask. I have also heard of a mercenary enclave that hires out henchmen. It is the Trade of Blades in the southeast, but I would avoid it.~ 
@64 = ~Wait! No... no I don't wish to make a scene. I have... important work that must not be interrupted. Fine, you may have your gold... but... Rest assured, <CHARNAME>, that you damn yourself with this act. You anger powers you do not understand. Go, commit your petty evils. I have important work to do!~ 
@65 = ~You are foolish beyond measure. Ask what questions you have and get out of my sight.~
@66 = ~You are not welcome in my sight. In fact, be thankful you yet live. You should be dead, but I have important work to do that must not be interrupted by petty vengeance.~
@67 = ~What would you make of my time? Speak quickly, for I have much to do.~
