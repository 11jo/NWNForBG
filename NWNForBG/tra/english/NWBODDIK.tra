@0 = ~Hello there, my good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. You don't have the look of one of those Neverwinter soldiers about you, neither do you show any evidence of having contracted the plague. But you have a certain bearing about you that distinguishes you from the ordinary citizen. Based on my observations I'd venture the hypothesis that you are an adventurer, correct?~ [NWBODD51] /*But you have a certain bearing about you that distinguishes you from the ordinary citizen. Based on my observations I'd venture the hypothesis that you are an adventurer, correct?*/
@1 = ~You're right, I am an adventurer. My name is <CHARNAME>. Who are you?~
@2 = ~NP: Now I don't have time to talk. Goodbye.~ /*I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.*/
@3 = ~I am Boddyknock Glinckle, a gnome sorcerer from the island of Lantan who has only recently arrived here in Neverwinter.~
@4 = ~Lantan? Isn't that the place where all those crazy inventions come from?~
@5 = ~A sorcerer? I thought Lantan looked down on magic.~
@6 = ~What are you doing in Neverwinter?~
@7 = ~Then there's no logical reason to continue this conversation, is there? But if you find yourself in need of a good sorcerer come speak to me again.~
@8 = ~My homeland does have a reputation for producing marvelous machines and outlandish contraptions not otherwise known in Faerun. We Lantanese are a people guided by the analytical principles of science: observation, reason and logic. But don't allow yourself to be misled by rumors and hearsay. We aren't all kooky inventors as some would have you believe. I myself am a sorcerer, for example.~ /*We Lantanese are a people guided by the analytical principles of science: observation, reason and logic. But don't allow yourself to be misled by rumors and hearsay.*/
@9 = ~I'm looking for a good mercenary to help me in my mission.~
@10 = ~As a practitioner of arcane magic yourself you must surely have encountered the suspicion and fear with which most common folk regard our art. My homeland is not so different.~
@11 = ~The Lantanese people do not disparage magic, though many do not understand it. However, in my land we rely on the arcane far less than the other peoples of Faerun. We prefer to seek a scientific solution to a problem rather than a magical one. Often through observation and experimentation a problem can be solved without resorting to mage-craft.~ /*We prefer to seek a scientific solution to a problem rather than a magical one. Often through observation and experimentation a problem can be solved without resorting to mage-craft.*/
@12 = ~Of course, sometimes a little touch of the arcane is a good thing. When the situation is appropriate I do not hesitate to use my powers, <CHARNAME>. I may be from Lantan, but I am first and foremost a sorcerer.~
@13 = ~Your mission? And what mission would that be, exactly?~
@14 = ~NP: I work for Aribeth. I've been tasked with finding the missing creatures that will serve as ingredients for a cure for the plague.~ /*I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that are ingredients for a plague cure.*/
@15 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@16 = ~I left my home some time ago to experience the broader world. It is not uncommon for the people of my island to undertake such a journey. I was exploring the northern Sword Coast when I heard rumblings of a previously unknown plague breaking out in Neverwinter. In the name of scientific discovery I came to investigate and catalog the new illness.~ /*I was exploring the northern Sword Coast when I heard rumblings of a previously unknown plague breaking out in Neverwinter. In the name of scientific discovery I came to investigate and catalog the new illness.*/
@17 = ~A confidential mission from Lady Aribeth? Given the circumstances it is not difficult for me to surmise that your mission is somehow connected to finding a cure for the plague. Given my own scientific interest in the plague I would be glad to accompany you in your mission, <CHARNAME>.~ /*A confidential mission from Lady Aribeth? Given the circumstances it is not difficult for me to surmise that your mission is somehow connected to finding a cure for the plague.*/
@18 = ~Yes, I suppose extracting a cure from certain reagents could be a possible method of countering the rapid spread of this epidemic. Given my own scientific interest in the plague I would be glad to accompany you in your mission, <CHARNAME>.~ /*Yes, I suppose extracting a cure from certain reagents could be a possible method of countering the rapid spread of this epidemic.*/
@19 = ~Fortunately I arrived before the city was quarantined. I decided to begin my investigations of the Wailing Death in the Beggar's Nest.~
@20 = ~Why the Beggar's Nest?~
@21 = ~From the accounts I gathered, it was generally agreed that the Beggar's Nest was where the outbreak began. I thought the best way to learn about the plague was to trace it back to its source. And when I learned the clerics were unable to combat the plague I thought that I could apply the scientific principles of Lantan to discover a more mundane cure.~ /*From the accounts I gathered, it was generally agreed that the Beggar's Nest was where the outbreak began. I thought the best way to learn about the plague was to trace it back to its source.*/
@22 = ~Unfortunately I had to end my investigations into the Beggar's Nest mere days after they began. Far too short a time to conduct a proper study of the situation.~
@23 = ~Why did you stop your investigations?~
@24 = ~All evidence seems to indicate you are a capable <PRO_MANWOMAN> who isn't afraid of a little adventure and exploration. I'll join up with you for 200 gold pieces.~ /*All evidence seems to indicate you are a capable <PRO_MANWOMAN> who isn't afraid of a little adventure and exploration.*/
@25 = ~I could use a good sorcerer. Here's your 250 gold. Welcome aboard, Boddyknock.~
@26 = ~How about 150 and the promise you'll experience wonders you've never seen before?~
@27 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@28 = ~Goodbye.~
@29 = ~It is difficult to conduct a serious scientific analysis when you are constantly beseiged by zombies. Much as I wanted to continue my research, I was not about to throw my life away to do it. However, the zombie infestation struck me as more than mere coincidence. I suspect there may be more than a casual relationship between the animated corpses in the district and the outbreak of the plague itself.~ /*It is difficult to conduct a serious scientific analysis when you are constantly beseiged by zombies. Much as I wanted to continue my research, I was not about to throw my life away to do it.*/
@30 = ~While the zombies continue to wander the district I cannot test my theory, but I suspect information that could lead to a cure can be found within the Beggar's Nest.~
@31 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some hired help to assist me on my mission.~
@32 = ~I'll be going now. Goodbye.~
@33 = ~NP: Every expedition needs a leader. Since you are paying, of course, it makes sense that you should be in charge. I will use my spells and skills to help you to the best of my ability.~ /*Every expedition needs a leader. Since you're paying it's only logical that you should be the one in charge.*/
@34 = ~NP: There was something said about a new experience. Okay, I agree with your proposal. 600 gold, and deal. I will use my spells and skills to help you to the best of my ability.~ /*There is something to be said for new experiences. Okay, I agree to your terms. 200 gold it is.*/
@35 = ~You're not the only one looking to hire me. It wouldn't be logical for me to cut my rate with demand exceeding supply. My offer stands at 250.~
@36 = ~If you can't afford a henchmen, why are you speaking with me? That doesn't make sense, does it? Come on back if you come up with the gold to hire me.~
@37 = ~NP: Are you here again? This makes me conclude that you need my help. How can I be of service to you?~ [NWBODD52] /*You are back, <CHARNAME>. That would lead me to conclude that you require some assistance from me. How can I be of service to you?*/
@38 = ~Who are you again?~
@39 = ~I want to ask you some questions about Neverwinter.~
@40 = ~My knowledge of the city is somewhat limited, as I have not been here very long. My arrival coincided precisely with the closing of the gates and quarantine of the city. I came in the name of scientific curiosity, to catalog and study this newly discovered plague that had broken out in the North. I concluded that the most logical place to begin my investigations of the Wailing Death was in the Beggar's Nest.~ /*My knowledge of the city is somewhat limited, as I have not been here very long. My arrival coincided precisely with the closing of the gates and quarantine of the city.*/
@41 = ~Good to see you again, <CHARNAME>, though in actual fact I cannot say I am really surprised. When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be one of those recruited.~ [NWBODD53] /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would be one of those recruited.*/
@42 = ~What are you doing here, Boddyknock?~
@43 = ~You again? Are you following me? I've never been stalked by a gnome before.~
@44 = ~NP: I was going to continue my exploration of the North. But then I heard that Aribeth was recruiting mercenaries to find the cult that was causing the plague. You can get the cure for the plague and punish those behind it<CHARNAME> , but the process by which the Howling Death spread has not yet been determined.~ /*You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.*/
@45 = ~I am *not* stalking you, <CHARNAME>! I have a vested, scientific interest in investigating the Wailing Death and the events that transpired in Neverwinter. You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.~ /*You may have discovered a cure for the plague and flushed out those behind it, <CHARNAME>, but the process by which the Wailing Death was spawned has not yet been determined.*/
@46 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. If you find yourself in need of a sorcerer you know where to find me... until someone else hires my services.~
@47 = ~Given my scientific interest in this plague, and my desire to ensure it is never again unleashed upon Faerun, it was only logical that I answer Aribeth's call for aid.~
@48 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@49 = ~NP: How much will it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@50 = ~When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists. Our instructions were simply to make ourselves available to whomever requires our assistance. So, in that spirit, is there anything I can do for you?~ /*When Aribeth recruited the mercenaries we were all paid in advance for our services - well paid. Lord Nasher is sparing no expense in tracking down these cultists.*/
@51 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@52 = ~I have heard people claiming the cult has a base in the plains to the south, others insist there is undeniable evidence of the cult in the forests to the east, still others swear the cult is hiding in the city of Luskan to the north. Obviously such rumors and hearsay are of little value. I prefer to put my faith in hard, empirical evidence - evidence I can observe with my own two eyes. As yet, I have found no evidence I consider reliable.~ /*Obviously such rumors and hearsay are of little value. I prefer to put my faith in hard, empirical evidence - evidence I can observe with my own two eyes. As yet, I have found no evidence I consider reliable.*/
@53 = ~But you must have an opinion of where to start looking.~
@54 = ~I don't think you understand. Without the proper data to analyze my evaluation of the situation would result in a hypothesis with an unacceptable margin of error. Naturally I have formed some preliminary theories, but if I were to venture any opinion on this matter it would be nothing more than a complete and utter guess.~ /*Naturally I have formed some preliminary theories, but if I were to venture any opinion on this matter it would be nothing more than a complete and utter guess.*/
@55 = ~So guess, Boddyknock. Sometimes you've just got to play a hunch.~
@56 = ~A... a hunch? You are a strange <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <CHARNAME>. But I suppose if I were forced to make a... shudder...guess I would say we should start our search in the Neverwinter Wood, to the south east of Port Llast. Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.~ /*Roots, herbs and other flora grow in abundance in the forest, many of which can be used to heal a variety of illnesses. It is only logical to assume such plants can also be used to bring sickness and death.*/
@57 = ~Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group. The Neverwinter Wood seems to be the only place that provided the seclusion and the materials that would have been necessary for the cult to bring about the Wailing Death. At least, that's my best guess.~ /*Plus the woods are shunned by most civilized people - they believe they are haunted - making it a perfect place for a secret hideout for a large group.*/
@58 = ~You seem to have some solid reasons... for a guess.~
@59 = ~So are you going to investigate the woods?~
@60 = ~I could use a sorcerer by my side, Boddyknock.~
@61 = ~As I said, I had a preliminary hypothesis. However, I would not be at all surprised to find my theory about the Neverwinter Wood to be wrong.~
@62 = ~I am an accomplished sorcerer, <CHARNAME>, but I also have a realistic understanding of my own limitations. Surviving the wilds of this region alone would be a challenge that surpasses my capabilities. Besides, Aribeth has hired us so that we may serve and assist others who are more suited for heroism and great deeds.~ /*I am an accomplished sorcerer, <CHARNAME>, but I also have a realistic understanding of my own limitations. Surviving the wilds of this region alone would be a challenge that surpasses my capabilities.*/
@63 = ~You are a well known hero, <CHARNAME>. If I were to accompany you I am certain my skills would be of some use.~
@64 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@65 = ~NP: In that case, I'll be glad to join your cause,<CHARNAME> . It's an honor to serve a hero like you. I will follow you and do my best in obedience to the order you have given.~ /*Then I will be glad to join your cause, <CHARNAME>. It is an honor to serve with a hero such as you.*/
@66 = ~Well met, <CHARNAME>. It is I, Boddyknock Glinckle from the island of Lantan. I trust you remember me from our last meeting. When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.~ [NWBODD55] /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.*/
@67 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@68 = ~NP: When Aribeth called in the mercenaries, we were all paid up front for our services - well paid. You managed to get a cure for the plague, but the process by which the Howling Death spreads has not yet been determined. I long to solve this mystery, if only such horrors can be told to the whole world. But the matter will be brought to an end only when we discover this cult.~ /*I am eager to solve that mystery, if only so such a horror can never be unleashed upon the world yet again. But that can only be accomplished if we first locate the cult.*/
@69 = ~Greetings, good <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Forgive me for being so bold, but you are the one known as <CHARNAME>, aren't you?~ [NWBODD54]
@70 = ~Yes, I am <CHARNAME>. How did you know?~
@71 = ~No, I think you have me confused with someone else.~
@72 = ~My hypothesis was based upon your manner of dress and physical appearance combined with the descriptions I have heard from those praising the <PRO_MANWOMAN> responsible for saving Neverwinter from the Wailing Death.~
@73 = ~NP: Well, this is not only my merit. Aribeth and the other city guards did no less.~ /*Well, I wasn't acting alone. Aribeth and the other city guard did as much as I.*/
@74 = ~Everybody recognizes me now. I guess that's the price I pay for being a living legend.~
@75 = ~Ah, forgive me then. I will have to go back and reevaluate the data I was basing my assumption on.~
@76 = ~Your modesty is admirable, but the facts cannot be denied. Others may have been involved, but everyone is in agreement that you played a particularly crucial role.~
@77 = ~Now I understand why they praise your abilities, and not your modesty.~
@78 = ~I am Boddyknock Glinckle, a gnome sorcerer from the island of Lantan. I must confess that I am not surprised to find you here, <CHARNAME>. When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.~ /*When I heard Aribeth was recruiting people to aid in the search for the cult behind the Wailing Death it was a simple logical leap to assume you would joining us.*/
@79 = ~NP: I came to Neverwinter to study the plague - its causes and effects - in order to avoid a similar catastrophe in the future. You have managed to obtain a cure for the plague, but the process by which the Howling Death spreads has not yet been determined. I long to solve this mystery, if only such horrors can be told to the whole world. But the matter will be brought to an end only when we discover this cult.~ /*I am eager to solve that mystery, if only so such a horror can never be unleashed upon the world yet again.
