@1    = ~(Remain silent and kill the boy with a single blow.)~
@2    = ~Hold. I was told to kill someone in this chamber, but I won't kill a child. You should get out of here, kid.~
@3    = ~(After a few seconds, the child's lifeless body hits the ground. You completed the genie's task.)~
@4    = ~(You don't hear any response. Just after you finished your sentence, circles of magical energy surround the child... moments later, he disappears.)~
