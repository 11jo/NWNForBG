@0 = ~Greetings. Are you in need of a blessing? I would not travel the docks without it, lest you tempt the fates.~
@1 = ~What can you tell me about the Seedy Tavern?~
@2 = ~Has there been any sign of a break in the plague?~
@3 = ~What good do your blessings do?~
@4 = ~I will have a blessing.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~NP: This is a nest of corruption. I will not believe a single word of a regular in these places. They play with their lies and false hopes. Luckily they're secluded and only let in those who are in uniform or have anything to do with their damned money.~ /*It is a den of corruption. I would not trust the word of any who frequent there. Lies and false hopes are their playground.*/
@7 = ~NP: The Howling Death continues to take lives, but Dester has declared that we brothers will not rest while the city is in crisis. If the inhabitants of Neverwinter have enough fortitude, the city will live. People need to believe and hope, that's why we continue to distribute blessings.~ /*If the spirit is willing, Neverwinter will survive. People must believe and have hope, and so our blessings will continue.*/
@8 = ~NP: If this pestilence primarily affects the soul, as Dester suspects, that's where the cure should begin. Our blessings are priceless. Even as the Howling Death takes the body, the mind knows there is still hope.~ /*The worth of the blessings is immeasurable. Even as the Wailing takes the body, the mind knows there is hope.*/
@9 = ~But the body still dies. How does that give hope?~
@10 = ~Very good. Let your mind be at ease and know that tomorrow will bring a cure.~
@11 = ~Another time, then. I will be here, as will all of the devout under Desther and Helm.~
@12 = ~NP: Well... it's hard to explain. Even in death, people must understand that... that everything happens for a purpose. I think your faith is strong. You understand how important faith is, and what a help it will be the moment when our blessings overcome the pestilence.~ /*You seem strong in your faith. You understand how important belief is, and how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.*/
@13 = ~NP: Well... it's hard to explain. Even in death, people must understand that... that everything happens for a purpose. I don't know if you'll understand, but try to imagine what a boost to faith it will be when our blessings overcome the pestilence.~ /*I can't expect you to understand, but just imagine how reaffirming it will be when our blessings beat the plague.*/
