@0 = ~What's this? Am I finally to be rescued, or are you another of the wizard's servants?~
@1 = ~Are you a prisoner here?~
@2 = ~Stand back! I'll have no tricks out of you!~
@3 = ~I'm certainly no servant of the wizard, no.~
@4 = ~I am. My name is Samuel... an inspector for the city guard, until that mad wizard took me prisoner.~
@5 = ~You're Samuel? Captain Thurin sent me to look for you.~
@6 = ~How do I know you're actually a prisoner, that this isn't some ruse?~
@7 = ~I'd appreciate some information, first.~
@8 = ~What reward would I get for letting you go?~
@9 = ~Would you be able to find your way out on your own?~
@10 = ~I'm not here to rescue you. Get out of my way.~
@11 = ~I am unarmed and no threat to you, I'm sure. My name is Samuel... an inspector from the city guard... and a prisoner of the wizard, unfortunately.~
@12 = ~That's a relief. My name is Samuel... an inspector for the city guard. I was beginning to think no one would ever free me.~
@13 = ~He did? It's good to know he didn't abandon me... I was almost afraid that, well... nevermind. Thank you for coming to release me.~
@14 = ~I've no reason to lie to you. I've no weapons... I'm completely at your mercy, in fact. If you would release me, I'm sure my captain would even reward you.~
@15 = ~MT: I do not trust you. Die!~ /*I don't trust you. Time to die!*/
@16 = ~Of course. I'll tell you whatever I know, though it probably isn't much.~
@17 = ~Just how did you end up prisoner here?~
@18 = ~What do you know about this place?~
@19 = ~All right. I'm done with you now.~
@20 = ~I've no money of my own... but my captain might reward you. Otherwise all I can offer you is some information about this place.~
@21 = ~Yes, I could use some information.~
@22 = ~You're of no use to me. Get lost.~
@23 = ~Yes... yes, I believe I could. I'd try to, at least.~
@24 = ~Then go. The way behind me is clear.~
@25 = ~Perhaps you should accompany me. It would be safer that way.~
@26 = ~You mean... I can just go? Just like that?~
@27 = ~Don't know. What in it for me?~
@28 = ~I never said that. Killing you would be more fun! Ha ha ha!!~
@29 = ~MT: *sigh* Actually, I was just wandering around the mansion, trying to sort out the rumors that Meldanen was up to something even weirder than usual. I couldn't find anything, but I think I was right. Meldanen captured me and shouted that I was trying to steal something from him. I have no idea what he was talking about ... but he was convinced that I was up to something bad, and he was not going to let me go.~ /**Sigh* I was just poking around the estate, actually, looking into some rumors I'd heard of Meldanen acting even more strangely than usual.*/
@30 = ~But why would he keep you prisoner? A member of city guard?~
@31 = ~MT: Very little. I was kept in captivity, and Meldanen refused to explain anything. I think he lives downstairs, in the underground floor.~ /*You can learn a lot in a small dark room. Don't let anyone tell you different.*/
@32 = ~MT: Thank you,<SIRMAAM> . I have no doubt that I can get out of here. I just wish I could get my revenge on that damn wizard! When you leave this place, look for Captain Turin. I'm sure he'll want to thank you for finding me. See you!~ /*Once you leave this place, seek out Captain Thurin. I'm sure he will want to thank you for finding me. Fare you well!*/
@33 = ~Samuel, a militia soldier previously reported as 'missing in action,' was recently freed from his captivity within Meldanen's estate in the Blacklake District. Grateful for his rescue, he will be returning to file a report with his commanding officer, Thurin, at the Board Laid Bare tavern. Those responsible for his rescue are encouraged to speak with Thurin regarding their reward.~
@34 = ~MT: It is not necessary,<SIRMAAM> although I appreciate your suggestion. You would only be delayed because of me, there is no doubt. When you leave this place, look for Captain Turin. I'm sure he'll want to thank you for finding me. See you!~ /*Once you leave this place, seek out Captain Thurin. I'm sure he will want to thank you for finding me. Fare you well!*/
@35 = ~Ahhhh!! Help me, someone!~
@36 = ~I don't know. Meldanen wouldn't ordinarily do this... lots of other things, perhaps, but not take a guard hostage. I don't know what he's up to.~
@37 = ~MT: Blackshire: Saving Samuel Guardian Turin of Blackshire has offered a reward for the return of one of his men. The missing soldier named Samuel was a close friend of Turin, and his disappearance after another check made Turin seriously worried.~ /*Thurin, a militia officer in the Blacklake District, has offered a reward for the safe return of one of his men. The lost soldier, Samuel, was a close friend of Thurin's and his failure to report back following a recent inspection assignment has caused the officer no small amount of worry.*/
