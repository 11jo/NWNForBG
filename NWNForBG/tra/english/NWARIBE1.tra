@0 = ~You're certainly welcome. I am Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, paladin in the service of Tyr and the right hand of Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter. I have been waiting for you.~ [NWARI051] 
@1 = ~I came as quickly as I could, Lady Aribeth.~
@2 = ~You were waiting for me? Why?~
@3 = ~I'm here now. Say what you have to say.~
@4 = ~Neverwinter needs you to survive the Howling Death. The attack on the Academy doused the one faint spark of hope this city had. I need you to help recover that which we have lost, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI054]
@5 = ~It will be an honor to serve you, Lady Aribeth!~
@6 = ~I serve no master but myself!~
@7 = ~I'll help you... for a price.~
@8 = ~I have recovered one of the reagents for the cure.~
@9 = ~I knew I could count on you, <CHARNAME>. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this, it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.~ [NWARI055]
@10 = ~You will answer only to me, <CHARNAME>, and I will give you free reign in your tasks.~ [NWARI120]
@11 = ~I promise your reward for this task will be well worth your efforts. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this, it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.~ [NWARI121]
@12 = ~Well done, <CHARNAME>! I knew you wouldn't let me down!~ [NWARI125]
@13 = ~Explain about the Yuan-Ti in the Beggar's Nest.~
@14 = ~Explain about the Intellect Devourer in the prison.~
@15 = ~Explain about the Dryad in the Blacklake district.~
@16 = ~Explain about the Cockatrice in the Docks district.~
@17 = ~Our divine healers can do nothing to help those afflicted by the Wailing Death, and even our most powerful magic cannot raise those who succumb to the illness.~ [NWARI057]
@18 = ~I heard of the trouble in the Beggar's Nest. This malevolent thing was behind it? As if the plague was not enough. <CHARNAME>, where others have found only failure you have discovered shining success. Neverwinter is in your debt. Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.~ [NWARI126] 
@19 = ~That was the reason we lost contact with those in the prison? As if the plague was not enough. <CHARNAME>, where others have found only failure you have discovered shining success. Neverwinter is in your debt. Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.~ [NWARI127]
@20 = ~It is shameful the way such a gentle creature is mishandled. The plague does enough harm without us adding to it. <CHARNAME>, where others have found only failure you have discovered shining success. Neverwinter is in your debt. Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.~ [NWARI128] 
@21 = ~That old scoundrel? I suppose I cannot expect such men to give up their ways, even in times like this. <CHARNAME>, where others have found only failure you have discovered shining success. Neverwinter is in your debt. Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.~ [NWARI129] 
@22 = ~But a short time ago we had word that Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, the famous archmage of Waterdeep, had discovered a potential cure, one that might be concocted from the essence of four rare and magical creatures.~ [NWARI058]
@23 = ~I have heard such rumors before.~
@24 = ~What became of these creatures?~
@25 = ~Time's wasting. Get to the point, Aribeth.~
@26 = ~You have earned a place of honor among those who sought to aid Neverwinter in these dark times. You will stand with us as the ritual to create the cure is performed. Are you ready to go to the ritual chamber? We must leave as soon as possible.~ [NWARI135] 
@27 = ~Yes - let's go at once!~
@28 = ~No - I need to take care of a couple things.~
@29 = ~Under great secrecy the four creatures were gathered in Waterdeep then sent here to Neverwinter, as strange a menagerie as any has ever set eyes on: a cockatrice, an intellect devourer, a yuan-ti and a dryad.~ [NWARI059]
@30 = ~Then we shall waste no more time - Neverwinter has suffered long enough!~ [NWARI137]

@32 = ~You have earned the right to stand with those who sought to aid Neverwinter in this dark time. I will spare a few minutes for you to get ready. But you must hurry, <CHARNAME> - Neverwinter has suffered long enough. Return and speak to me when you are ready to go on.~ [NWARI138] 
@33 = ~I ordered them sent to the Academy, Neverwinter's renowned training institution for adventurers of every ilk. I once studied there myself and I thought the instructors and students were loyal to Lord Nasher. And then the Academy was attacked.~ [NWARI060] 
@34 = ~Go ahead.~
@35 = ~So you think someone within the Academy betrayed you.~
@36 = ~The attack took us by surprise. After this massacre at the Academy, only a handful of people remained alive, including you. Fenthick and Desther arrived with reinforcements, but during the confusion of battle the Waterdhavian creatures disappeared into the streets of Neverwinter - and our hopes of a cure vanished with them.~ [NWARI062] 
@37 = ~How may I serve you in this, Lady Aribeth?~
@38 = ~Let me guess, you want me to get those creatures back.~
@39 = ~What you want me do now, Aribeth?~
@40 = ~The Academy may have been betrayed from within. Or perhaps I simply put too much faith in the instructors, students and staff to keep this news secret, as Desther claims.~ [NWARI061]
@41 = ~Your task in this is twofold, <CHARNAME>. First, find the Waterdhavian creatures and bring them back to me at any cost. We need to harvest components from these creatures if we are to concoct a cure for the Wailing Death. This is your most important duty.~ [NWARI064]
@42 = ~Second, we must discover who was behind the attack on the Academy. Any evidence you uncover in this matter should be brought to Fenthick. He is the one assigned the task of unmasking our hidden enemy.~ [NWARI066]
@43 = ~I will do as you command, Lady Aribeth.~
@44 = ~I'll do it, but the rewards better be worthwhile!~
@45 = ~Why did you choose me for this?~
@46 = ~Shouldn't the city watch be helping in this?~
@47 = ~How do we even know the creatures are still alive?~
@48 = ~I ask for your discretion in this matter, <CHARNAME>. News of the attack and strange creatures roaming the city will only add to the panic and chaos already in the streets. There is little else I can tell you about this mission, <CHARNAME>. Whenever you need provisions come speak to me again and I can sell them to you through the store here at Tyr's temple.~ [NWARI073] 
@49 = ~Whatever rewards you seek - fame, fortune, glory - you shall have in abundance. Provided you are successful in this task.~ [NWARI072]
@50 = ~Your skill and courage are evident, and I know that you are not with those who want to destroy Neverwinter. The city watch can do little to help in this search; their numbers are barely enough to keep order in the streets of Neverwinter. Others, like Fenthick or myself, have duties that require we stay here.~ [NWARI070] 
@51 = ~The city watch can do little to help in this search; their numbers are barely enough to keep order in the streets of Neverwinter. Others, like Fenthick or myself, have duties that require we stay here. You proved yourself during the attack on the Academy, <CHARNAME>. Your bravery and skill are obvious, and I know you are not in league with those who seek to destroy Neverwinter.~ [NWARI071] 
@52 = ~By all accounts the creatures escaped the battle at the Academy unharmed, and there are many reports of strange beasts pouring in from every district of the city. You must recover the Waterdhavian creatures if we are to survive the Wailing Death. The fate of Neverwinter rests on your shoulders now.~ [NWARI068] 
@53 = ~Take this gold so you can buy the necessary supplies for your mission. Remember to stock up on healing potions before you go. They will be critical to your survival.~ [NWARI160]
@54 = ~I will begin my search for the Waterdhavian creatures at once!~
@55 = ~I need to ask you some questions.~
@56 = ~It would be nice to know a little more about the Lady I'm working for.~
@57 = ~Tell me about Fenthick.~
@58 = ~What do you think of Desther?~
@59 = ~Goodbye.~
@60 = ~You might want to seek someone to accompany you in your mission. There are a number of mercenaries for hire at the Trade of Blades, located in the City Core. A good place to begin your search for the missing creatures might be the Peninsula District. There have been several eyewitness accounts of strange beasts in the area. Farewell, <CHARNAME>. May Tyr guide your steps.~ [NWARI076]

@62 = ~I will do my best to answer what questions I may, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI079]
@63 = ~What can you tell me about the attack on the Academy?~
@64 = ~I want to know more about the Wailing Death.~
@65 = ~I want more information on the Waterdhavian creatures and this cure.~
@66 = ~Where can I get some supplies?~
@67 = ~I am not one to boast of my accomplishments, <CHARNAME>. Suffice to say that I am a Paladin of Tyr and I am honored Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the Wailing Death. Is there anything else, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI112] 
@68 = ~It is no secret that Fenthick and I are lovers. Our feelings for each other are only matched by our devotion to Tyr and our loyalty to Neverwinter. Although Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the plague, I could not do this without Fenthick's help. His faith and conviction are a comfort to me in times of darkness. Is there anything else, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI113] 
@69 = ~I think the Helmite is arrogant, sanctimonious, self-righteous and holier-than-thou! Forgive me for being so blunt, but Desther and I do not see eye to eye. Desther challenges my every decision on general principle, or so it would seem. He is constantly accusing me of abandoning my faith and not trusting enough in the power of the divine.~ [NWARI116] 
@70 = ~Why do you put up with him?~
@71 = ~Maybe he has a point.~
@72 = ~It was a slaughter, as you well know. Only a handful of the hundreds training and teaching at the Academy survived. As yet we have not discovered the identity of those behind the attack, but the enemy knew the Waterdhavian creatures were there. How they came by that knowledge is a troubling prospect. Take any information concerning who may be behind the attack straight to Fenthick. He is the one I have placed in charge of unmasking our hidden enemy.~ [NWARI080] 
@73 = ~I want to ask you about something else.~
@74 = ~The first victims were reported several months ago, and within days it had spread to all corners of the city. It was not the first plague Neverwinter has suffered, but it is by far the worst. Unlike other sicknesses, the Wailing Death seems to resist all efforts to cure it, including the divine magic of the priests. Perhaps that is what makes it so terrible.~ [NWARI092] 
@75 = ~The room next door is full of plague victims. Aren't you scared of being infected?~
@76 = ~Did the quarantine do anything to help?~
@77 = ~It was Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, the archmage of Waterdeep, who discovered the potential cure. However, we have not even had a chance to test it. The creatures were taken from us too quickly. If Blackstaff is right, the cure requires feathers from a cockatrice, the brain of an intellect devourer, blood from a yuan-ti and a lock of hair freshly plucked from a dryad's head.~ [NWARI099] 
@78 = ~I have no equipment to spare - all we have was given to the city watch to help them maintain order. Perhaps I could sell you some things from the temple armory... Yes, I will arrange to sell you whatever I can. When you next come back, ask me for temple services. If I don't have something, the city core has all manner of shops to supply you with whatever you might need.~ [NWARI110] 
@79 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. May Tyr guide your steps.~ [NWARI078]
@80 = ~Sometimes I think Desther and his Helmites do more to hinder my efforts than help them. But Fenthick assures me they bring hope to the city, and hope is something the people desperately need. Is there anything else, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI119] 
@81 = ~My faith in the power of Tyr is strong, yet I understand sometimes the Gods rely on mortal means to accomplish their ends. Mere blessings and prayers are not enough to end this plague, despite what the Helmites believe.~ [NWARI118]
@82 = ~The plague does not seem to spread through contact with the infected. Healers tend to the sick without becoming ill, and some who lock themselves alone indoors contract the illness. We have quarantined the city, but that is mostly to help the watch maintain order. It has done little to halt the spread, though some districts remain unaffected.~ [NWARI094] 
@83 = ~We have quarantined the city, but that is mostly to help maintain order. It has done little to halt the spread of the disease - though some districts remain largely unaffected. The plague does not seem to spread through contact with the infected. Healers tend to the sick without becoming ill, and some who lock themselves alone indoors contract the illness.~ [NWARI097] 
@84 = ~Is there more you would know? Any information about the creatures I can provide to help you locate them will be freely given, of course.~ [NWARI101]
@85 = ~Tell me about the cockatrice.~
@86 = ~Tell me about the yuan-ti.~
@87 = ~Tell me about the intellect devourer.~
@88 = ~Tell me about the dryad.~
@89 = ~You gonna kill monsters for make cure?~
@90 = ~Me not need nothing else 'bout Waterdeep monsters.~
@91 = ~Perhaps that is what is so terrible about this affliction. There is no rhyme or reason to it, seemingly no way to guard against it and, until we have all the Waterdhavian creatures, no way to cure it. Is there something else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI096] 
@92 = ~A cockatrice resembles a hybrid of chicken, lizard, and bat. They are repulsive animals that can petrify opponents. You must be extremely cautious when dealing with this beast.~ [NWARI102]
@93 = ~The yuan-ti are a race of beings whose bloodlines are a mixture of human and snake. They can be any combination of snake and human characteristics. They are highly intelligent and many of the creatures practice magic. It is rumored that some even have the ability to alter their shape.~ [NWARI103] 
@94 = ~The intellect devourer is a truly horrible entity, resembling a large fleshy brain with legs. It can dominate the minds of its victims so that it may devour their very thoughts.~ [NWARI104]
@95 = ~She is like most of her kind: a beautiful, elusive forest sprite whose charms transcend mere physical appearance. Out of charity, she came willingly to help us when she learned of our need. However, the city is strange to her and unsettling. When the attack came I suspect she fled in panicked terror, and now is lost among the unfamiliar streets and buildings of Neverwinter.~ [NWARI106] 
@96 = ~A single drop of blood, a single scale, a lock of hair - all these can be collected with no harm to the creatures. Only the monstrously evil intellect devourer needs be slain to collect the reagent. Is there more you would know? Any information about the creatures I can provide to help you locate them will be freely given, of course.~ [NWARI109]
@97 = ~Is there something else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ [NWARI083]
@98 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. Do you have news of the missing Waterdhavian creatures? Or is there something else you need?~ [NWARI123]
@99 = ~I need to talk to you.~
@100 = ~I found a note you might be interested in.~
@101 = ~I require temple services.~
@102 = ~I am injured. Can you heal my wounds?~
@103 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I will do my best to help with whatever you need to know.~ [NWARI124]
@104 = ~Let me see... hmmm... You were right to bring this note to our attention. Take it to Fenthick - he is the one in charge of unmasking the enemy behind all this. He will find your note most interesting, I am sure. What can I do for you?~ [ARIBE142] 
@105 = ~Aribeth looks you over, then raises her hands in praise of the Even-Handed, Tyr. You begin to feel better.~
@106 = ~Welcome back, <CHARNAME>. You have done a great thing in recovering the first of the reagents for us. It is but one small step toward our ultimate goal, but it gives me hope. And I know with your help Neverwinter shall yet be saved!~ [NWARI144] 
@107 = ~One of the bards here in Castle Never is composing a song to honor your adventures during the recovery of the second reagent, <CHARNAME>. I believe I heard Lord Nasher himself humming the tune in the halls. People are beginning to take notice of you, <CHARNAME>.~ [NWARI147] 
@108 = ~You are a welcome sight, as always, <CHARNAME>. Is this visit in regards to the fourth Waterdhavian creature? We are all eagerly awaiting its recovery. As soon as we have the fourth component we can begin the ritual to create the cure.~ [NWARI150] 
@109 = ~I have the last of the reagents from the Waterdhavian creatures.~
@110 = ~Truly the heart of a hero beats within your chest, <CHARNAME>! Of all who have sought the creatures you have proven yourself above everyone else!~ [NWARI152]
@111 = ~We have all four reagents now. Quickly, <CHARNAME>, time grows short. You have earned a place of honor among those who sought to aid Neverwinter in these dark times. You will stand with us as the ritual to create the cure is performed. Are you ready to go to the ritual chamber? We must leave as soon as possible.~ [NWARI155]
@112 = ~I'll be right back.~
@113 = ~I am sorry, but I cannot discuss Neverwinter's business with you. Let <CHARNAME> come to me. I will only talk to them.~
