@0 = ~Hello, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. You best be careful treadin' the road 'round these parts. A dangerous place, these days. Listen to old Gerrol.~ [GERRO053]
@1 = ~You're Gerrol? Your son mentioned you.~
@2 = ~What do you do around here?~
@3 = ~What's so dangerous about this area?~
@4 = ~Could you give me some directions?~
@5 = ~I'll be on my way.~
@6 = ~He did, did he? He's a fine lad, he is. I expect, then, that you're some manner of adventurer that he thought could help us, aye?~
@7 = ~What kind of help do you need?~
@8 = ~He seemed to think so, yes.~
@9 = ~Not so fast, old man.~
@10 = ~NP: For the most part, I cultivate the land. Although, to be honest, it has become dangerous to do this here lately. It wasnt always like that. Lately it seems like the whole north is under siege. And all we ordinary people can do is help each other in any way we can.~ /*It wasn't always this way, of course. In recent days it seems like the entire north is under siege. All us common folk can try to do is help each other as much as we can.*/
@11 = ~NP: In the local hills, who just does not live ... bugbears, goblins, other creatures. Usually they dont bother much. But when Luskan stopped patrolling here, thats when they took courage. They have been attacking anyone who tries to pass through this area for several weeks now. Even the farms were attacked... thats when they took my wife.~ /*The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don't trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, mind you, they've become plenty brave.*/
@12 = ~I suppose so. What are you looking for?~
@13 = ~Where is the nearest inn?~
@14 = ~Can you tell me the way to Luskan?~
@15 = ~I'm told there are caves in this area.~
@16 = ~Let us speak of something else.~
@17 = ~NP: Yes, be careful if you go to the hills<SIRMAAM> . Good luck.~ /*Aye, do be careful if you go into the hills, then, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I wish you well.*/
@18 = ~Well, now, that's a bit of a tale. I'm surprised the boy didn't fill you in.~
@19 = ~It's a dangerous thing to ask of anyone, but it might be worth your while, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. Let me fill you in, in case the boy didn't.~
@20 = ~I didn't mean to imply that you'd agreed to anything, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I'm just pleased that you've come. Let me explain what's been happening, here.~
@21 = ~I figure it's all that Dergiab's doing. Damn ogre will get what's coming to him one way or another, I swear it!~
@22 = ~What's this about your wife?~
@23 = ~Who is this Dergiab?~
@24 = ~Why would Luskan stop patrolling?~
@25 = ~Why don't you just leave?~
@26 = ~NP: Her name is Leah. She was stolen from the farm one evening while the boy and I were walking around the hills. There was nothing we could do about it. These creatures have never kidnapped people before... I have no idea why they would do that. Dergiab is definitely behind this.~ /*Leah is her name. She was taken from the farm one evening when the boy and I were out scouting the hills. Nothing we could have done about it.*/
@27 = ~NP: Dergiab is an ogre mage... he is quite cunning, he decided that he was destined to lead other monsters. How he got it into his head I dont know, but as far as I know hes building an army for himself. What he was going to do with her, even scary to think. I have sent a message to my old friend Aarin Gend, but have not yet received a response from him. He seemed to have more important things to do now, given the circumstances.~ /*I went and sent a warning off to my old friend Aarin Gend, but I haven't heard back from him yet. I s'pose he's got more important things on his plate right now, all things considered.*/
@28 = ~You know Aarin Gend?~
@29 = ~NP: Did this news reach you? Ever since the plague began in Neverwinter, Luskan has kept the gates locked. No one is let in, no one is let out. I never particularly liked their soldiers ... sometimes behaved like the last bandits. But ever since they stopped patrolling the area, we realized that they were the lesser evil.~ /*I never liked their soldiers much... like bandits, sometimes, the way they act. Since they stopped patrolling, however, it makes you realize what worse things they kept in check.*/
@30 = ~NP: Id love to move to the city until things get quieter. But I cant leave without my wife Leah... or until I know exactly whats wrong with her. And I will make Dergiab pay for the encroachment on my family and land. Thats why I sent the boy to Port Llast to find adventurers... one of them could handle it.~ /*And failing that, I'll make sure Dergiab pays for crossing me an' mine. That's why I sent the boy to Port Llast to find adventurers... one of them folk should be able to do something.*/
@31 = ~Perhaps I could help.~
@32 = ~I can only pray that she's all right, yet. I'll get her back, somehow... and then that ogre will pay for all the grief he's caused me.~
@33 = ~Maybe you could, at that. I can reward you, if that's what you're keen for. I'll warn you, though... you wouldn't be the first adventurer to head into the hills.~
@34 = ~There have been other adventurers?~
@35 = ~What kind of reward are we talking?~
@36 = ~I have some questions.~
@37 = ~NP: Ill take care of it.~ /*Me go and get it.*/
@38 = ~I have other things to do.~
@39 = ~NP: Oh yeah. Old friend, thats what I said. You dont think Ive been a farmer all my life and dug in the ground, do you? Ha! Someday we will all settle down. If I were younger, I would have gone into the caves myself and rescued Leah. If only I could. And now Ill have to wait for a young adventurer to do it for me.~ /*If I were in my younger days, I'd go into those caves and find Leah for myself. I wish I could. As it stands, I'll have to wait for some younger adventurer to take up the task for me.*/
@40 = ~If Luskan was keeping order, Dergiab never would've gotten it in his head to make his move... and my wife would still be here.~
@41 = ~NP: Well, the nearest inn is probably the Union Arms in Port Llast. Its not that long to go there. I cant think of anything else, except, perhaps, the Green Gryphon tavern, next to Luskan, its in the north, behind the hills. If you really had a hard time, then stay with me at the farm, though I have not much to offer you,<SIRMAAM> .~ /*Other than that, the only inn I can think of would be the Green Griffon Inn outside of Luskan, to the north past the hills.*/
@42 = ~NP: Its a little further north<SIRMAAM> . You just keep to the road, thats where youll get, Im telling you right. Im telling you right now, youre wasting your time. Luskan is closed and sealed... theyll just send you to the Green Gryphon to wait, thats all. However, its your business.~ /*I can tell you right now that you're wasting your time. Luskan is shut up tight... they'll just send you to wait at the Green Griffon Inn, is all. It's up to you, though.*/
@43 = ~NP: Yes. These places are full of caves, and in the caves of different creatures. The nearest entrance is in the hills to the southeast of here. There are also two caves to the south. If you cant fight seriously yet, dont go into those hills. There are many dangerous creatures there.~ /*Aye. Plenty of caves in these parts, and full of creatures of all sorts. Nearest entrance is in the hills just to the north.*/
@44 = ~NP: How else can old Gerrol help you,<SIRMAAM> ?~ /*Something else old Gerrol can do for you, then, <PRO_GIRLBOY>?*/
@45 = ~Aye, a few have passed this way and headed into the hills to check out the creatures for themselves. None have returned, I'm afraid to say.~
@46 = ~NP: To be honest, I dont have much left since Ive been looking for adventure. But Id be happy to give whats left for news of my wife... or better, for her to return home safe and sound. I would pay gold for Dergiabs head, just to make sure he doesnt hurt anyone else. I know its not much... but Dergiab is rich himself, and I think there is something to profit from there.~ /*To be honest, I haven't much left from my adventuring days. I'd be happy to offer what gold I have, though, to have some proof of what happened to my wife... or, better yet, to have her returned.*/
@47 = ~NP: Yes? Ill tell you all I can<SIRMAAM> .~ /*Aye? I'll answer whatever I can, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
@48 = ~Tell me of this Dergiab.~
@49 = ~Where do I find these caves?~
@50 = ~Do you know anything about a cult in the region?~
@51 = ~Do you think your wife is still alive?~
@52 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@53 = ~I'd be grateful for it. Find my wife or bring me proof of what's happened to her... and bring me Dergiab's head, if you can. Either would be a great service.~

@55 = ~NP: As you wish. It is very dangerous. If you happen to find my wife... or her remains... I just want to know. And in case you suddenly stumble upon Dergiab. I will pay for his head in gold. But I think you have your own reasons for going into the caves<SIRMAAM> .~ /*Same goes if you encounter that Dergiab. I'd pay gold for his head. But I'm sure you've your own matters to attend to, <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
@56 = ~NP: Well, its an ogre mage... hes smarter than his bloodthirsty cousins, and much more powerful. He can become invisible and has many spells. Dergiab has been the leader of many monsters there for a long time. Before, he had never been able to muster the courage to dare to do anything significant... I dont know what it was all of a sudden.~ /*Dergiab's led a lot of the other creatures for quite some time, now. Never been brave enough to really do anything drastic, however... I'm not sure why he would start now.*/
@57 = ~NP: There are several entrances scattered in the hills. But at the bottom they all connect like a labyrinth... dont get lost. Theres one entrance directly southeast of here. Just keep in mind that most of Dergiabs servants will see you before you see them.~ /*There's a few of them spread out in the hills. They all connect together underground in a large warren, however... be sure you don't get lost.*/
@58 = ~NP: Cult? That is, in connection with Dergiab and his creatures? Hmm. Yes, perhaps I don’t know ... although this could explain Dergiab’s increased ambitions. To be honest, I always thought that Dergiab for all these monsters is something like a god. I would be surprised if he formed an alliance with someone else. Although, who knows.~ /*To be honest, I always thought Dergiab fashioned himself as a bit of a god amongst them other monsters. I'd be surprised if he allied with anyone else. You never know, however.*/
@59 = ~I... I certainly hope so, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. It all depends on what Dergiab wants with his prisoners. I've braced myself for the worst, to be honest.~
@60 = ~NP: Well, well... As I said, I will give you a reasonable reward for your help. I suggested this to all other adventurers as well.~ /*Fair enough. Like I said, I'll give you what reward I can, if you help me out. It's the same offer I've made to any other adventurer that's come by.*/
@61 = ~Well, hello to you. Were you the one I told about them monsters bothering us around here - the ones who took my wife, Leah? Do you bring word?~ [GERRO055]
@62 = ~The monster's leader, Dergiab, is dead. I have his head.~
@63 = ~I have Leah's ring right here. She's dead.~
@64 = ~I see Leah made it back safely.~
@65 = ~I would like some directions.~
@66 = ~NP: So far there is no news.~ /*No. No regrets.*/
@67 = ~I've no time for your errands.~
@68 = ~That is a relief, then, to be sure. We'll have none of his terrorizing anyone else in these parts. Thank you, <PRO_GIRLBOY>... I hope this bit of gold will do as a reward.~
@69 = ~I think killing Dergiab is worth a bit larger reward, no?~
@70 = ~I might have to rough you up and see what else you got in there.~
@71 = ~NP: I dont need a reward. Happy to help.~ /*No reward is necessary. I was glad to do it.*/
@72 = ~It will do.~
@73 = ~NP: A. I... I thought so. Well, its good that now I know for sure ... although it will be difficult for me to tell the boy. Thank you,<SIRMAAM> for your words, they put my mind at ease. I hope this little gold will cover your expenses.~ /*Ah. I... I had thought as much. I suppose it is good to know, at least, though it will be difficult to tell the boy.*/
@74 = ~I think peace of mind is worth a bit more, no?~
@75 = ~I think you can cough up a bit more. Wouldn't want to get rough.~
@76 = ~NP: I cant take money for bad news.~ /*Me not take gold for sad news.*/
@77 = ~That she did. She has returned safe and sound, which is more than I even thought possible. Thank you, <PRO_GIRLBOY>... I shall be forever grateful. I hope this bit of gold will do as a reward?~
@78 = ~I think your wife's safety is worth more than that, no?~
@79 = ~What is it you want me to do again?~
@80 = ~NP: Ill tell you everything I know. What are you looking for?~ /*Tell me what you've heard about Desther.*/
@81 = ~Well, come and see me when you have something to tell me. Be careful! This area is dangerous.~
@82 = ~NP: As you wish. I only asked. If you find out something please let me know.~ /*As you wish, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I was only asking. If you do discover something, please do tell me.*/
@83 = ~I imagine you got plenty from Dergiab, himself, no? I would love to give you more... I just can't spare it.~
@84 = ~NP: Okay, I agree.~ /*Okay, me go now.*/
@85 = ~And here I thought things would be safer with the monsters gone. Sigh... fair enough. It may be a bit greedy of you, but it's not like you didn't earn it.~

@87 = ~It is the least I could do.~
@88 = ~I have little enough left to give you, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. My wealth from my adventuring days is long gone.~
@89 = ~NP: Hmm. I dont remember that the search for adventure was to intimidate old people. But so be it ... here. This is all I can afford.~ /*Hmph. I don't remember adventuring being about bullying the common man. But have it your way... here. It is all I can afford.*/

@91 = ~NP: You... you<MALEFEMALE> real, thats what<SIRMAAM> . Thank you.~ /*You... you are a good <PRO_MANWOMAN>, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. I appreciate it.*/
@92 = ~Aye, perhaps you are right. Here, <PRO_GIRLBOY>... let me give you a little more, then. It is all I have.~

@94 = ~NP: I already told you about this, huh,<SIRMAAM> ? Okay, if I repeat, it wont hurt. The hills in this area are full of different creatures... bugbears, goblins, and so on. They usually dont bother us much. But since Luskan stopped patrolling this area, they have become very bold. They have been attacking anyone who tries to pass through this area for several weeks now. Even the farms were attacked... thats when they took my wife Leah.~ /*The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don't trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, they've become plenty brave.*/
@95 = ~All of this is likely the doing of the leader of them monsters, Dergiab. No one will be safe until he's dead. You bring me word of my wife or his head... I'll reward you for either.~
@96 = ~NP: I... I hope so. It all depends on what Dergiab wants from his captives. Although, to be honest, Im ready for the worst.~ /*I... I certainly hope so, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. It all depends on what Dergiab wants with his prisoners. I've braced myself for the worst, to be honest.*/
@97 = ~Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things seem a lot safer around here, but I do miss Leah dearly.~ [GERRO050]
@98 = ~NP: But Leah is back.~ /*I see Leah made it back safely.*/
@99 = ~Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things are just about to right with Leah's return to the farm. To think, I thought her dead for sure.~ [GERRO051]
@100 = ~I'll be forever grateful for what you've done for the area, too. It's safe once more. You and yours are always welcome at our humble farm.~
@101 = ~Things are just about right... but not quite. The area is still unsafe so long as Dergiab is still about.~
@102 = ~Hello. It's been mighty sad around here since you've confirmed the worst. My wife is dead. How go things with the monsters that killed her?~ [GERRO054]
