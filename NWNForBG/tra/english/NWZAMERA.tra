@0 = ~*Sigh* I wish we didn't have to come here so often, but since the plague, Billiam hasn't been able to take the boys hunting. Not that I mind... so much blood...~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Excuse me, I must be leaving.~
@3 = ~Oh, please no. I'm not in any mood to talk. It's bad enough I'm even here, but Billiam, he insists the children come.~
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~Who is Billiam? Why does he insist these children come here?~
@6 = ~What do you know of this place?~
@7 = ~Fare you well in this difficult time.~
@8 = ~My name is Lady Zemeria. I am just a citizen of the Blacklake. You'll forgive me if I don't feel like going into more detail? The troubles of the day weigh heavily on my mind.~
@9 = ~Billiam is my husband. He's not adjusting well to the plague. I imagine he feels helpless, and doesn't want the children to feel the same way. He means well, but I question his methods. I don't much care for this place.~ /*Billiam is my husband. He's not adjusting well to the plague. I imagine he feels helpless, and doesn't want the children to feel the same way.*/
@10 = ~If you don't like this place, why do you permit it to continue?~
@11 = ~I know we are here all too often. All hours of the day, it seems. Billiam looks at the animals and thinks of old conquests. I suppose we all have our retreats in hard times. I don't care for the conditions the beasts are kept in, but I have no say in that. Montgomery Weatherson directs the place.~ /*I know we are here all too often. All hours of the day, it seems. Billiam looks at the animals and thinks of old conquests. I suppose we all have our retreats in hard times.*/
@12 = ~Are you acquainted with him?~
@13 = ~No, and I don't really care to. I am tolerant of my Billiam's rough edges, but I see no reason to go looking for others with a similar bent.~
@14 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@15 = ~I'm not sure who you think I am, but I don't have that kind of influence. Many people support the zoo. Many would oppose closing it down. The druid Nyatar had begun talks to make changes, but now that the plague has everyone's attention I guess the animals don't seem that important.~ /*The druid Nyatar had begun talks to make changes, but now that the plague has everyone's attention I guess the animals don't seem that important.*/
@16 = ~I will see this place shut down!~
@17 = ~Will you, now? I won't be particularly sad to see it go. I won't get involved, however. I have enough to worry about, as it is.~
