@0 = ~I am returned to preserve the heart of this place. The demon who suppressed me is banished, and I am free.~
@1 = ~You have allowed the will of Helm to return, yet your nature is tainted by evil. We shall be cautious allies. I offer this assistance: An enchanted ring, an expertly crafted bow, or the strength of Helm to aid you.~ 
@2 = ~I want the magic item.~
@3 = ~I will take the weapon.~
@4 = ~Grant the power of Helm to aid me.~
@5 = ~I don't want anything from you.~ 
@6 = ~You have done as your conscience commanded, and have allowed the will of Helm to return. Your motives are pure. To you I grant something extra: A enchanted ring, an expertly crafted bow, the aid of Helm, or my insight of what comes.~ 
@7 = ~Grant me your insight.~
@8 = ~Your nature is indeterminate. Are you aiding the balance, or merely acting on a whim? I am your cautious ally. I offer this assistance: An enchanted ring, an expertly crafted bow, or the strength of Helm to aid you.~
@9 = ~Accept the gifts of Helm. Use them to guard and in the fulfillment of duty. Few are rewarded in this manner. I must go elsewhere, and fortify against the coming darkness. Go forth, and do what must be done.~ 
@10 = ~It is your choice to refuse the gifts I offer. I would have chosen otherwise, but this fight is not yet mine. I must go elsewhere, and fortify against the coming darkness. Go forth, and do what must be done.~ 
@11 = ~You seek guidance from the divine. That shows a presence of mind I find lacking in many. Ask and I shall answer.~
@12 = ~Where is my enemy?~
@13 = ~Who is Desther's master?~
@14 = ~Why was Neverwinter attacked?~
@15 = ~How do I bring peace to the world?~
@16 = ~A broad question. Desther is near, and easily found. Those behind him are shrouded, unknowable in their strangeness. I see layers of evil, seeded with hate, but the foundation is unknown. I can't see the beginning, but I fear what may come.~ 
@17 = ~Maybe you answer more questions?~
@18 = ~Fear, anger, desire. He is a slave to each of these. The master that commanded him is no longer his master. Desther is abandoned, his usefulness at an end. Now he defies fate. The power he tampers with is strange. It is ancient, and I cannot see the hand that moves it.~ 
@19 = ~The plague became an attack only after being unleashed. Desther did not start it, but he did spread it and delayed the cure. The Wailing attacked the spirit, rotting the body around the soul. The essense of the victim fell away, along with the hope of others. That fabric did not disappear. Someone or something has benefitted from what was lost. The plague has fed its master.~ 
@20 = ~I've seen many a road paved with such dreams. Unfortuantely, not many travelers end up where they intended. That said, I imagine destroying whatever threatens Neverwinter will bring a great deal more peace than exists currently. In the global sense, bringing peace means either appeasing the needs of - or, more likely, destroying - everyone.~ 
@21 = ~I cannot. Such sights are tiring. I hope this has proved valuable. There is little else that I can do. But such is your purity that you will receive a further boon. Accept this not lightly, for you have recieved a true blessing. I must go elsewhere, and fortify against the coming darkness. Go forth, and do what must be done.~ 
@22 = ~I have no true answer as to why. I cannot see. That worries me. It worries me.~
@23 = ~If I thought you were capable of this, the fight ahead of you would be altogether different and, likely, against me.~
