@0 = ~Oh, thank you for unraveling me from that cocoon! I thought I was dead for sure.~
@1 = ~I am glad I was able to find you down here. Who are you?~
@2 = ~NP: Its too dangerous for me here. Choose on your own.~ /*Come here or I'll feed you your own intestines as sausage*/
@3 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@4 = ~My name is Orlane. I am a druid who was sent by my leader Aawill to find out what is wrong with the Spirit of the Wood.~
@5 = ~I have met Aawill. My name is <CHARNAME> and I was sent to rescue you.~
@6 = ~NP: I am from the team<CHARNAME> . Aaville sent us to look for you.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. Aawill sent me to find you.*/
@7 = ~NP: Thats exactly what Im doing. What can you tell me about the current situation?~ /*No, but I'm working on it. What can you tell me about the situation?*/
@8 = ~No. Some of the other druids have gone missing too. Do you know where they might be?~
@9 = ~So you're one of the druids I was looking for. Glad I found you.~
@10 = ~I will in a moment, but for now I just need to clear my head of the spider's poison. Could you please sit with me until I'm up to leaving? It shouldn't take too long.~
@11 = ~Please don't be long. I can't stand the touch of these spider webs.~
@12 = ~Thank the balance for Aawill. He is a strong leader.~
@13 = ~So how did you get captured?~
@14 = ~What were you doing down here?~
@15 = ~Well, it is obvious that something is severely wrong with the Spirit of the Wood. It seems to have gone crazy. Usually the Spirit enters and exits the Wood through a pool in the north part of the forest, but from what I could gather, the Spirit hasn't been seen for a while.~ /*Well, it is obvious that something is severely wrong with the Spirit of the Wood. It seems to have gone crazy.*/
@16 = ~Tell me more about this pool.~
@17 = ~You mean there's a cave under the pool?~
@18 = ~I haven't a clue. We separated, so that we could discover as much as we could, then we were supposed to meet up back in the grove. As you know, I never made it. I guess the others didn't either. I wonder if they found out more than I did?~ /*As you know, I never made it. I guess the others didn't either. I wonder if they found out more than I did?*/
@19 = ~Tell me what you've learned about the Spirit of the Wood.~
@20 = ~So how did you get down here?~
@21 = ~I hope you are feeling better now. You should get going.~
@22 = ~I am glad you found me too. That must mean that Aawill sent you. Thank the balance for Aawill. He is a strong leader.~ /*I am glad you found me too. That must mean that Aawill sent you.*/
@23 = ~I was sent into the Wood to find out why the creatures were attacking everyone. I tried talking to a deer in one clearing, but the poor thing's mind was so confused that it attacked me.~
@24 = ~You were attacked by a deer? I've never heard of such a thing.~
@25 = ~Ha! You got your butt kicked by a deer?~
@26 = ~The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.~
@27 = ~Why didn't you go into it?~
@28 = ~What do you mean another realm?~
@29 = ~No, it's a kind of portal. The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.~ /*The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.*/
@30 = ~I should be fine now. Again, I can't thank you enough for your assistance. Good luck.~
@31 = ~It came right at me and I tried to dodge, but it caught me in the side with a hoof. It reared up to strike me again, but then it suddenly turned and ran off.~
@32 = ~I got up to try and follow, but then I heard a soft chittering sound behind me. I turned around, but before I even saw what was happening, something soft with long hairy legs and mandibles leapt on top of me.~
@33 = ~The spiders attacked you on the surface?~
@34 = ~Surprised twice? You were really alert for danger, weren't you?~
@35 = ~It's not funny. I would have been ready for an attack if it had been a wolf or a bear, but nobody expects to be attacked by a deer.~
@36 = ~I don't know much about the pool, except a few legends. I do know that no living creature can get through the portal and into the other realm. According to an old druid I once met, the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so it can go through the portal at will, but we can't.~ /*According to an old druid I once met, the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so it can go through the portal at will, but we can't.*/
@37 = ~So now what am I supposed to do?~
@38 = ~It's another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.~
@39 = ~I didn't even know what it was at first. I felt the thing bite me and suddenly the entire world started to spin. Next thing I knew I was in here, all wrapped up. I was just waiting to feel another bite when you came along and set me free. Again, thank you so very much. Now I need to find my companion druids and see if we can figure out what to do about the Spirit of the Wood.~ /*I was just waiting to feel another bite when you came along and set me free. Again, thank you so very much. Now I need to find my companion druids and see if we can figure out what to do about the Spirit of the Wood.*/
@40 = ~I had to kill the Spirit of the Wood, so the problem is resolved.~
@41 = ~NP: I managed to heal the Spirit of the Forest. Now you can safely return to the grove.~ /*I have cured the Spirit of the Wood. You may return to the other druids in peace.*/
@42 = ~NP: Do you know what happened to the other druids sent out to find you?~ /*Do you know what happened to the other druids who were searching for answers?*/
@43 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@44 = ~I was a little distracted at the moment. You get kicked by a deer and see how you feel.~
@45 = ~I don't know. Maybe if you find the other druids that were searching, they could help you. Otherwise you might want to talk to a nymph. Maybe they haven't gone crazy like the animals.~
@46 = ~You did what? Why would... how could... you idiot! Without the Spirit, the Wood will never truly recover.~
@47 = ~I did what I had to do!~
@48 = ~NP: Be careful with accusations. No one knows that you managed to stay alive...~ /*Watch your insults. Nobody else knows I found you... if you take my meaning.*/
@49 = ~Praise be! What a marvelous thing. Surely your name will be sung on the wind for such a heroic deed. I shall be sure that others hear of your deed, good <LADYLORD>. Now if you will excuse me, I should be off.~ /*I shall be sure that others hear of your deed, good <LADYLORD>. Now if you will excuse me, I should be off.*/
@50 = ~I'm sure you think you did, but there had to be another path. Probably a harder path, but nothing worth doing is ever easy.~
@51 = ~You weren't there, so why don't you keep your judgments to yourself.~
@52 = ~I am terribly sorry for the damage I have done, but you don't know what it was like.~
@53 = ~I... I'm sorry. You did free me, so I guess I should be grateful. I just don't think you realize how much damage has been done.~
@54 = ~Time to get moving. You can make it out on your own?~
@55 = ~I... I guess I wasn't at that. I... I'm sorry. You did free me, so I guess I should be grateful. I just don't think you realize how much damage has been done.~ /*I... I'm sorry. You did free me, so I guess I should be grateful. I just don't think you realize how much damage has been done.*/
@56 = ~You came back. Can I leave yet?~
@57 = ~Why don't you tell me your story?~
@58 = ~NP: Can you get out of here on your own?~ /*Can you get away from here safely on your own?*/
@59 = ~I love nature, but not spiders. Not anymore. Thanks again for the rescue.~
