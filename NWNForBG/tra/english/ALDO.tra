@0 = ~Youuuuuu just watch yourself. If you're dead, so help me I'll make you deader!~
@1 = ~Easy, I'm not your enemy.~
@2 = ~Well that's just rude. Don't make many friends, do you?~
@3 = ~Watch who you threaten, fool!~
@4 = ~MT: Хмм! Мертвые не отвечают, значит, наверное, с вами все нормально. Но нельзя быть слишком осторожным, правда? Вы случайно не видели долговязого парня по имени Гектор, а? Послали его за запчастями для повозки, и, бес его побери, он просто пропал.~ /*You ain't seen a tall-folk named Hector, have ya? Sent him out for wagon parts and damned if he ain't just disappeared.*/
@5 = ~He's got to be dead. There's no way he'd survive.~
@6 = ~I saw him, but I didn't bring him with me.~
@7 = ~Hector? Yeah, he's here. A little out of sight though.~
@8 = ~I have no idea who that is and I don't care!~
@9 = ~Hey! What are you doing with Hector? Tall-folk idiot was supposed to get us some wagon parts!~
@10 = ~Dang it dang it DANG IT! Fool was supposed to bring wagon parts! Dead you say? Well, that tears it. Nothing more for it. I'm going to have to... leave the old girl.~
@11 = ~Tough break. Goodbye and good luck.~
@12 = ~Your wagon is shot. You'd better make a run for it.~
@13 = ~I could escort you to the Shining Serpent. It's supposedly safe.~
@14 = ~There may be a Helmite blessing sanctuary somewhere. I could lead you.~
@15 = ~I'll protect my wagon 'til the end, but it'd all be easier if he would just get back here with my parts! I've got wheels to fix!~
@16 = ~I'll tell him if I see him. Good luck.~
@17 = ~Shouldn't you go look for him?~
@18 = ~He's probably not coming back.~
@19 = ~Not my problem. Good luck. You'll need it.~
@20 = ~Probably hiding because he DIDN'T GET MY PARTS, THE IDIOT!! Okay, okay, calm down. I just have to figure out what to do.~
@21 = ~MT: Я приведу его, если увижу.~ /*I'll find him if I can.*/
@22 = ~No need to get all huffy. If you see him, just tell him to get those wagon parts back here quick.~
@23 = ~Yeah, thanks ever so much for your help. Off to the races I go, I guess. Is that something moving over there? Come on you undead freaks! Just try it!~
@24 = ~Looks like I don't have much choice now. Well, time to head off running, I think. No shuffling zombie can catch a halfling at full run, I say!~
@25 = ~That tavern doesn't have enough ale to make me forget abandoning what's mine. Thanks for all you've done, but I'm taking my chances on my own. Thanks anyway.~
@26 = ~Helmites, eh? No thanks. I don't believe a word of what those pious pie-faces are selling. I'm off on my own. Thanks, though.~
@27 = ~MT: Мне не везет. У меня сломалась повозка в городе, который кишит зомби. К тому же приходится терпеть насмешки жены. Но в любом случае спасибо.~ /*I don't get good luck. I get stuck in a zombie-filled city with a broken wagon and the scorn of my wife.*/
@28 = ~MT: Гнездо Нищих: Альдо и Гектор

В центре Гнезда Нищих находится семья Альдо, которая охраняет свою сломанную повозку. Они не могут уехать, пока не вернется Гектор. Гектор ищет в Гнезде инструменты и детали, чтобы починить повозку.~ /*A family is guarding a broken-down wagon in the center of the Beggar's Nest. They will not leave until Hector has returned. Hector is out searching the Beggar's Nest looking for parts for the wagon.*/
@29 = ~I gotta wait for him to come back. I ain't leaving the wagon until there's no other hope. Plain and simple.~
@30 = ~Don't know that. Maybe the parts are too big for him, but I ain't leaving my stuff until I have to, zombies or not!~
@31 = ~All right all right, relax, you lummox. Let's just figure out what we do now. Time to abandon ship, I'll wager. No parts means no wagon. Ah well.~
@32 = ~Thanks for bringing Hector here, friend. I think we'll find our own way out now. No sense staying... sure is a fine wagon, though. I'll miss you girl.~
@33 = ~MT: Гнездо Нищих: Альдо и Гектор

Поскольку в квартале не удалось найти деталей, необходимых для починки повозки, семье полурослика Альдо нет смысла больше оставаться возле нее. Они бросили повозку, чтобы уйти из квартала.~ /*Parts to fix the wagon could not be found, so there was no more reason for Aldo's halfling family to stay with it. They have abandoned it to try and escape the district.*/
@34 = ~More live ones! Imagine that! Now, if it was just that fool Hector and my PARTS!!~
@35 = ~You ain't seen a tall-folk named Hector, have ya? Sent him out for wagon parts and damned if he ain't just disappeared.~
@36 = ~We've got to get to safety!~
@37 = ~Don't start, woman! I'm doing my best over here!~
