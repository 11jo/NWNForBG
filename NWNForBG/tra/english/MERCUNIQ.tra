@1 = ~Could you answer a few questions for me?~
@2 = ~NP: Get out of my way, soldier boy.~ /*Out of my way, money-grubber.*/
@3 = ~NP: All right, I'm gonna go now.~ /*"It's all right. I understand."*/
@4 = ~I suppose I could.~
@5 = ~You're a mercenary. That mean you're for hire?~

@7 = ~I need some directions.~
@8 = ~I'm looking for some people.~
@9 = ~Watch your mouth, citizen.~
@10 = ~Stay out of trouble, citizen.~
@11 = ~NP: Not me, I've had my fill of monsters. Mayor Kendrak pays for my room and board, and I guard Port Llast from drunken sailors and the monsters that hang around. That's entertainment enough for me. You can talk to the other mercenaries at City Hall. It's the building behind me.~ /*Not me, I've had my fill of monsters. Mayor Kendrack pays my room and board and I guard Port Llast from drunken sailors and whatever monsters wander by. That's enough excitement for me.*/

@21 = ~NP: Do you know where I can find a priest?~ /*Know where I can find a priest?*/
@22 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@23 = ~When I left, the High Captains were fighting tooth and nail against each other, vying for the Arcane Brotherhood's attention. I doubt it's any different now, either.~
@24 = ~NP: Thank you, that's all I wanted to know.~ /*That's all I need to know.*/
@25 = ~NP: Some of us stay at the Herb of the Union, downtown. The ale there is bad, but the sheets are clean.~ /*A few of us maintain quarters at the Alliance Arms - south of the northern gate into town. The ale's not great but the sheets are clean.*/
@26 = ~NP: You can try to find simple things at the Cracked Anvil, it's east of the barracks, down the road. They have all the items you need there. I've been told that Halial hides something special under the counter as well. There's also a visiting alchemist selling potions in a tent near the town hall.~ /*For regular items, try the Cracked Anvil, east of the barracks, along the road. It stocks all of the basic items you'll need. Haljal has some special stuff set aside for his fellow dwarves, too, I hear.*/
@27 = ~Well, there is Charwood to the south. Never been there myself, though. They're a quiet folk, from all acounts, and don't stray far from home.~

@30 = ~NP: Mayor Kendrak, of course. He hired me. You can always find the mayor at city hall on the west side of town. Ugh. I don't need to explain, that's where you and I are standing.~ /*There is also a chance that powerful artifacts could be found alongside Halueth Never's remains, though I would not rest my hopes upon it.*/
