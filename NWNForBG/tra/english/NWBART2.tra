@0 = ~Greetings. Got a particular need this fine day?~
@1 = ~I've got a pass for the Gauntlet.~
@2 = ~Anything interesting in this tavern?~
@3 = ~Let's see what you have for sale.~
@4 = ~NP: Goodbye, I think I'll be going now.~ /*Goodbye, and good luck.*/
@5 = ~Shh. Don't say it so loud. Here's a key. Go on down when you want. It's the door in the center of the south wall. There are stairs leading down to the basement.~
@6 = ~What is the Gauntlet, specifically?~
@7 = ~Goodbye.~
@8 = ~NP: You already have the key. Go to the Glove if you want. The door is in the southwest corner of the tavern. There's a staircase leading to the basement.~ /*You've already got a key. Go on down to the Gauntlet, if you want. It's the door in the center of the south wall. There are stairs down to the basement.*/
@9 = ~Nothing that needs to be said out in the open. Nope, nothing at all.~
@10 = ~Come on, what harm is there in telling me?~
@11 = ~I don't want to resort to force, but I will if you don't tell me.~
@12 = ~Another time, friend.~
@13 = ~NP: This is a competition for those who believe that the most important thing is to be able to defend yourself against someone who wants to harm you. If you win, you get a title and congratulations. Lose, you get shaken down, and you're back in the fight. It's all to see if you're fit for battle.~ /*You win, you get a rank and a few cheers. You lose, you get dusted off and try again. It's about knowing your worth in a fight.*/
@14 = ~Why is this a big secret?~
@15 = ~Look, if you really want in on what happens here, you'll have to get a pass from a mercenary in the Trade of Blades. Then we'll talk.~
@16 = ~The Trade of Blades? What's that?~
@17 = ~No, I don't think so. It's nothing that concerns you.~
@18 = ~Hmm, maybe you'd fit right in, but it doesn't matter. Not unless you get a pass from a mercenary in the Trade of Blades. Then we'll talk.~
@19 = ~NP: Look, it's not exactly safe to go into the arena to have a relationship. We've had accidents. A couple people have lost limbs. The city guards think it's a very violent sport, but it's not. There's honor in combat, but they don't understand that. The guards only see what they want to see. If you want to try it, that's your right. Just don't talk about it and don't complain if you lose. People don't like that.~ /*The city guards think it's a bloodsport, but it's not. It's about honor in battle, but they don't understand. The guards just see what they want to.*/
@20 = ~If you don't know, I doubt you'll be back. It's the mercenary guild in the northwest of the City Core. That's all I'm saying.~
@21 = ~Well met, Boss. What can I do for you?~
@22 = ~Give me the earnings for the week.~
@23 = ~What do I have to do now that I own the bar?~

@43 = ~NP: The last owner, Claudus, had arranged things so that he didn't have to do anything. He was always busy doing something. All you have to do is come in once a week and make a profit. You won't make a fortune, but it's better than nothing. And besides, I wouldn't advise you to seek adventure. You seem to love it. It's dangerous to me, but lucrative, to be sure.~ /*Besides, I can tell you'd rather be out adventuring and such. You look like the type. It sounds dangerous to me, but I bet there's good coin in it.*/
@44 = ~NP: Have a nice day.~ /*Fare good.*/
