@0 = ~Good morrow to you, citizen. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they're replacing the ones we've lost, are they?~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Hmm, the more information you have, the less risk you'll pose to the rest of us on duty. I'll help if I can.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Stay alive out there, recruit.~
@8 = ~Well, you can't keep the peace without knowing where to keep it, can you? Sorry, it's an old guard joke my buddy used to tell before... nevermind.~
@9 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@10 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@11 = ~I know what I'm told. Aribeth and her lot handle all the delicate stuff. We common guards keep the peace where we can and maintain the quarantine at all costs.~
@12 = ~You sound like you don't particularly like Aribeth.~
@13 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@14 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@15 = ~All I hear is how bad things are getting, how many more men we've lost. It's like a war, except you can't make the Wailing surrender. With us gone, the different districts each hold their intrigues, I'm sure. All I know is that we're fighting a losing battle, even here in the Core...~
@16 = ~The city's always had Districts, but with the quarantine we've been ordered to lock things down. As a result, each District has ended up handling things differently. Which do you have questions about? There's the Beggar's Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, and the City Core? You need to know them all.~ 
@17 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@18 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@19 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@20 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@21 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula.~
@22 = ~There are several merchants in the City Core, but some are raising prices like there's no tomorrow. Of course, they might be right...~
@23 = ~She handles city security on a big scale, reporting to Lord Nasher. She brings in people like you for special missions, leaving us for little things like, oh, restraining plague-maddened rioters. Pardon me if I don't think she's more important than the dozens of us who have already been put to the torch thanks to the Wailing's touch!~ 
@24 = ~Not a thing. I was briefed on the Waterdhavian creatures, but nothing since. My life's on the line to keep the streets clear of rioters and looters. I do know that those damned Helmites keep getting in our way, though. I swear, their blessings better do HALF of what they say.~ 
@25 = ~What were you told about the Waterdhavian creatues?~
@26 = ~That the caravan bringing them was attacked when it entered the city. Nobody knows what happened to them after that - scattered to the wind, I guess. They didnt tell me the details. They just told me to keep an eye out for them to show up somewhere.~ 
@27 = ~The heart of the city is the business district around Castle Never. We managed to protect that from the plague, but not completely ... The rule of law is maintained here, and in the most strict way. It never hurts, especially now that the plague is ravaging the city. Of course, with most of what remains of the militia here, the other Districts are suffering. Hopefully that's where you can help.~ 
@28 = ~The Beggar's Nest is hurting bad. There's a lot of poverty - I've already lost three of my men to violence there and another eight to Wailing.~
@29 = ~The plague first appeared there. The first few cases were ignored as a "problem with the poor" but now there's something else ... People are barricading wherever they can, and there are even rumors of undead walking the streets. I'm afraid there's not much the guards can do to help.~ 
@30 = ~You're not saying everything.~
@31 = ~Look, the guards are hired to keep the peace and maintain the quarantine. We're hunters of the living, not the dead. We're scared, all right? You should be too! You want to throw yourself at whatever is in there, you go ahead. Good on you. Nobody cared about the Beggar's Nest before and it's not vital we save it now. Just remember that I've lost better men than you in there.~ 
@32 = ~Things are looking up, though. Somebody restored a semblance of order - Destroyed a whole infestation of undead. It sure makes our job a lot easier. Maybe you had something to do with that? If so, thanks. It's been pretty quiet in there ever since.~ 
@33 = ~The Docks are a nightmare to patrol even at the best of times. There's dirty gold there. Not a lot of respect for the city guards.~
@34 = ~The Wailing's brought out the worst in them. There's a panic for gold for some reason. Not sure why. The rich die too. There's not much we can do. Muggers and bands of thugs have the run of the place now. I guess they won the war...~ 
@35 = ~Things went a little nuts for a while, but it's settling down. Maybe you had a hand in that. Good for you if you did. Anyway, not much happening in there now, though I'm still losing men to the Wailing. We'll keep an eye on it though.~ 
@36 = ~Blacklake? Bunch of spoiled nobles. I don't think they've had a good word for the guards in the history of the city. And there's those rumors...~
@37 = ~People are saying the nobles stumbled on a cure and they won't share it with the rest of us. Probably not true, but it would be just like them. I even heard something about them openly threatening some of my guards. If they don't fall in line, the whole place is going to hell.~ 
@38 = ~In fact, I think they were talking revolt for a while, but somebody put a stop to it. Was that you? My thanks go out to you if it was.~
@39 = ~The Peninsula holds the prison. There's a good number of staff that live in the area, as well as people on their way out. Captain Alaefin runs the place and I hope he's doing okay because he's one of the best the city has to offer... There's been word of a prison riot, though. Tyr only knows we've never been able to instill fear in the inmates but maybe the Wailing finally has...~ 
@40 = ~The Peninsula holds the prison. There's a good number of staff that live in the area, as well as people on their way out. I'm not sure what all happened in there, but it seems to have calmed down now. Hell of a price to pay, though. Captain Alaefin was a good man and my thanks go out to whoever put him out of his misery. The riots have finally calmed down, though.~ 
@41 = ~Make sure I don't catch you around the Moonstone Mask. It's in the west near the Peninsula exit. You kind of look the type... They cater to the shady and the flamboyant. I suppose they do stock the odd thing that can't be had elsewhere... not legally, anyway. And if you want someone to back you up, check the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest. Good people there.~ 
@42 = ~You need nature-related supplies, don't you? You look the type. You should visit the Druid Tree in the Heart of the City, its in the southwest of the district, next to the gate. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Trade of Blades, to the southeast. Good people there.~ 
@43 = ~You look... I don't know, devout, I guess. You might want to check out the Temple of Tyr? Its in the Heart of the City, to the west, next to Castle Never. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Trade of Blades, to the southeast. Good people there.~
@44 = ~You are a spellcaster, right? The Cloak Tower is located in the east of the district. And if you want someone to back you up, check the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest. Good people there.~ 
@45 = ~You good with a weapon? Shining Knight Arms and Armor has the best gear - I shop there myself. Its south of the main square. And if you want someone to back you up, check the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest. Good people there.~ 
@46 = ~You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to Shining Knight Arms and Armor, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Thieves are welcome in the Moonstone Mask. And if you want someone to back you up, check the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest. Good people there.~ 
@47 = ~Can I help you? I cannot be away from my duty for long. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they're replacing the ones we've lost...~
@48 = ~You have my attention. Wait, you're one of the patchwork recruits, aren't you? Ahh, you're no substitute for experience.~
