@0 = ~Here I am... the fool. My stay here... with the dead... has taught me more in a few hours than... than I deserve.~ [NWFEN241]
@1 = ~He's a traitor. Desther. I helped him, and then followed hoping his deception was a mistake. I thought he would... He will return! Won't he?~ [NWFEN242]
@2 = ~What you do, Fenthick?~
@3 = ~Don't play games! You are in league with him!~
@4 = ~Where Desther go?~
@5 = ~NP: He'll come back! He couldn't lie to me! How could he lie?! All this time?! When people had doubts. I had to chase away their fears. A blessing is a gift, I tell you. THIS MAN CARES, I TELL YOU!!! I had to kill them... I killed them all by believing in him....~ /*He'll be back! He couldn't lie! How could he lie?! All this time?! When people had their doubts... I calmed their fears...*/
@6 = ~NP: No... yes. I don't know! He's coming back! To help people! The people. It was my duty to bring them comfort. when they doubted. A blessing is a gift, I tell you. THIS MAN CARES, I TELL YOU!!! I had to kill them... I killed them all by believing in him.....~ /*The blessing is a gift, I said. THIS MAN CARES, I SAID! I killed them... I killed them all by believing in him...*/
@7 = ~NP: Unless-- Unless I help him and he comes back. If he comes back, it's not for nothing. I should have helped him. He deceived us. Betrayed us. But if I help him and he comes back to Neverwinter, then I can help them...~ /*Unless... unless I help him and he comes back... if he comes back then I was right... I helped them...*/
@8 = ~Do you know who he is working for?~
@9 = ~Why didn't he want us to have the cure?~
@10 = ~Where is he now?~
@11 = ~I must find Desther. What do you intend to do?~
@12 = ~NP: I don't know. He's not a Helmite. The true inhabitants of Helm's Castle are dead. murdered. All to hide his true identity when he comes to Neverwinter. He says he is one of the Men of the Eye, a cult that worships the Ancients, but there is little to understand from his speech. It's like he's a different person. It's like he's being forced to be.~ /*He says he is one of the "People of the Eye," a cult following the "Old Ones," but I can't tell anything else from his ranting. It's like he's a different person... he has to be.*/
@13 = ~What are these Old Ones?~
@14 = ~Has he shed any light on the purpose of the "People of the Eye?"~
@15 = ~The plague... he gloated that he was sent to Neverwinter to spread it! His masters wanted it to last as long as possible! They wanted us all to die...~
@16 = ~Desther spread the plague? How?~
@17 = ~But what initially caused the plague? What started it?~
@18 = ~NP: Somewhere inside. is trying to raise the undead to defend his sanctuary. He has few followers left and hardly any new ones. He says he's no longer needed. He talks like a madman. Bloodthirsty. Heretical. I don't know that kind of Dester. How could he keep this from me...~ /*Somewhere inside... trying to raise undead to fortify this place. He has few followers left, and no more are coming. He claims he is being cast aside.*/
@19 = ~NP: Я... I don't know. I can't go back. Not now. You-- You can find him. Find Dester. Make him recant. Make him say he didn't betray us. Make him say I didn't let people die because of him.~ /*I... I don't know. I can't go back... not yet. You... you can find him. Find Desther. Make him recant. Make him say he didn't betray us.*/
@20 = ~A court decide that stuff. Or maybe a mob.~
@21 = ~Aribeth is waiting for you. Waiting for an explanation.~
@22 = ~Why shouldn't I kill you right now?!~
@23 = ~NP: He didn't say... He's fanatical... rabid. It's as if he wants his curses to override those words of Helm's servant that he made me believe... Whoever these Ancients are, they have abandoned him. He cries out that he deserves protection, but it doesn't come. Whatever his destiny was, it is over.~ /*Whatever these Old Ones are, they have abandoned him. He screams that he deserves protection, but none is coming. Whatever his purpose was, it is over now.*/
@24 = ~He rants about everything, but I can't make sense of it. They are fanatics... insane... they must be. Why else would all this have happened?~
@25 = ~NP: It's... These blessings... THESE BLESSINGS. contagious. vile. Every blessing given by him or his Helmites was contagious.... He could poison the harbors as well... The entire water supply... But the blessings gave false hope, so that people despaired much more when they did catch the plague.~ /*He could have poisoned the harbors... the whole water supply... but the blessings raised false hopes, so people would be even more desperate when they finally did get the plague.*/
@26 = ~NP: I don't know... Dester wasn't sent to Neverwinter until after the epidemic started. Whoever his masters were, I don't think they were able to prepare in time. Dester says all he had to do was prolong it... Keep us from being cured. There's something about the way it kills people... They wanted it to last as long as possible.~ /*Desther just says he was supposed to prolong it... to stop our cures. There's something about the way it kills people... something they wanted to last as long as possible.*/
@27 = ~I suppose it will come to that. I will wait for that judgment. I swear it. I will wait here. There's nothing else I can do...~
@28 = ~NP: No, I can't go. Я... I can't. I can't look into the eyes of my beloved. my Aribet. Leave me alone. I'll stay here, waiting for the guards. I swear. But I can't look at her. I can't.~ /*Leave me... I'll wait for the guards... I swear it... but I can't see her... I can't.*/
@29 = ~NP: Я... I don't know. There's nothing I can do, except, uh. except try to help. If he recants, it'll be all right. Leave me alone. I'll stay here and wait for the guards. I swear to you. There's nothing more I can do.~ /*I... I don't know. There's nothing I could do except... except try to help. If he recants, everything will be fine...*/
@30 = ~Such cruelty... carefully designed to destroy our wills... and I trusted him. Made other people trust him... their deaths are on my hands too...~
@31 = ~All those people... and I let him do it. I made people trust him.~
@32 = ~I followed Desther to help him... so he could prove that he was worth trusting. I followed... to save my conscience...~ [NWFEN269]
