@0 = ~Hey, thanks for springing me from that cell. I guess I owe you one. So, what can I do for you?~
@1 = ~Is there a reward for rescuing you?~
@2 = ~Who are you and what are you doing here?~
@3 = ~I've decided I'm just going to kill you.~
@4 = ~I'll be going now.~
@5 = ~NP: You didnt manage to think it through, did you? I am a prisoner here. Do you see the cage? Do you really think the fire giants would let their prisoner keep his gold? My name is Vogar. The fire giants caught me trying to sneak in here about a month ago. I thought they would kill me, but I managed to convince King Skrogg that I would make a bad stew but a good advisor.~ /*My name is Wogar. The fire giants caught me trying to sneak in here about a month ago. I thought they were going to kill me, but I managed to convince King Skrogg that I'd make a better advisor than a stew.*/
@6 = ~My name is Wogar. The fire giants caught me trying to sneak in here about a month ago. I thought they were going to kill me, but I managed to convince King Skrogg that I'd make a better advisor than a stew.~
@7 = ~What? But... Help! Intruders in the compound! They're trying to kill me!~
@8 = ~Off you go then. Good luck. Hope you get rid of Skrogg. It couldn't happen to a nicer guy. As for me, I'm out of here.~
@9 = ~I was just looking for a few gems or maybe some gold, and instead I end up a prisoner forced to use my brilliant mind to help out a Giant King too stupid to rule his own people!~
@10 = ~Why would the King want a half-orc for an advisor?~
@11 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@12 = ~NP: Lets get rid of these stupid stereotypes! I can bet that Im no dumber than you. At least Im smarter than any of the giants in this damned place! You know, not all half-orcs are born idiots. Do you think the king would have spared my life if I gave him bad advice? But all this time I was collecting information to run.~ /*Hey, don't lay your stereotypes on me! I'm as smart as you, I'd wager. I'm a damn sight smarter than any of the giants in this place, at any rate!*/
@13 = ~Information?~
@14 = ~Sure, I've picked up a ton of information since I got here. I can tell you about Klauth, and I can tell you about the dragon experiments going on in the basement.~
@15 = ~Tell me about Klauth.~
@16 = ~Tell me about the dragon experiments.~
@17 = ~NP: Klauth is an ancient red dragon who has made his lair under the fire giants settlement. King Skrogg and all his giants serve Klauth. It looks like they worship him, almost like a god. But Klauth is old even for a dragon, and his days are numbered. Thats why the giants collect dragon eggs: he uses them for his wild experiments in the basement.~ /*Klauth is an ancient red dragon who's made his lair here beneath the giant complex. King Skrogg and all his giants serve Klauth. It's almost like they worship him as some kind of god or something.*/
@18 = ~Klauth has some Yuan-Ti sorcerers working for him. Those damn shapeshifters have been using magic to grow an egg into a full grown dragon in the space in a few months instead of the centuries it normally takes.~
@19 = ~I'm not sure why they're doing this, but I know the adult dragons tend to disappear after reaching maturity. I bet it has something to do with Klauth trying to recapture his youth. He's pretty old, even for one of his kind.~
