@0 = ~Get away from my tree! You must die!~
@1 = ~No, please let me live! I give up.~
@2 = ~The rage... it burns me up... makes me want to kill you. I am trying to control it, but please be quick. What do you want?~
@3 = ~What is causing the rage?~
@4 = ~Why did you attack me?~
@5 = ~I don't know. The rage just fills my mind. It makes everyone seem like an enemy. I don't know you or who you are except that something makes me hate you.~
@6 = ~What could affect your mind in such a strong manner?~
@7 = ~It seems to be affecting the whole forest.~
@8 = ~I guess you had better flee now. Goodbye.~
@9 = ~I think I had better kill you before you try to kill me.~
@10 = ~MT: Do you really need to talk to me? I must run soon, otherwise I will be forced to attack you again. The only being I know of that has the power to do this is the Spirit of the Forest. But he had never done harm before. I don't know where it all came from. No!<He/She> spares my life. I shouldn't do this. Sorry,<LADYLORD> .~ /*Must you keep talking to me? I must flee soon, or else I will be forced to attack you. The only being I know of who has that kind of power is the Spirit of the Wood.*/
@11 = ~Do you know what I might do to stop it?~
@12 = ~Stay calm and keep control. I don't want to have to hurt you anymore.~
@13 = ~MT: No. I won't run away! I'll knock you off your feet and kill you... oh no. Yes. I will run away. You need to get away from my tree. If you are near, I will lose my head and attack you again. Goodbye and good luck to you.~ /*No. I will not flee! I will strike you down and kill... oh no. Yes. I will flee. You must get away from my tree. If you remain close I will lose control and attack you again.*/
@14 = ~Not without a fight, tree-killer!~
@15 = ~I don't know. I can't think. The Spirit hasn't been here in a while. It doesn't travel by here now. I don't know why. Maybe if you could find someone whose mind isn't affected by the Spirit's power.~
@16 = ~Who wouldn't be affected?~
@17 = ~Stay calm! There are demonic talons pressing into my mind and burning it away into nothing, and you want me to stay calm! I am doing my best.~
@18 = ~How should I know? I never go far from my tree! You are the ones free to roam around! You should know these things. You're so stupid I should... uh, nevermind. Maybe the druids could help, or the nymphs, or even the witch.~
@19 = ~Tell me about the druids.~
@20 = ~Why would the nymphs not be affected?~
@21 = ~MT: Tell me about the witch.~ /*Tell me about yourself.*/
@22 = ~There were some druids wandering around here a while back. I don't know where they went because I was hiding so I wouldn't have to attack them. They were dangerous. They wanted to hurt my tree! No, no. That is the hate speaking.~
@23 = ~I didn't say they wouldn't, did I? I just said they might not. How should I know? Um, sorry. I don't mean to keep yelling at you like that.~
@24 = ~MT: Setara - Forest Witch. She comes here sometimes. She's bad and wants to eat me! No, wait, she's nice and helps me. Oh, how I wish I could think coherently. It is so hard. But if you want to deal with Setara, be careful. She has difficulty communicating with people. It's because of her face, of course.~ /*Setara is the Witch of the Wood. She comes here sometimes. She is bad and wants to eat me! No wait, she is good and she helps me. Oh, I wish I could think clearly. This is so hard.*/
@25 = ~What do you mean 'because of her face?'~
@26 = ~I think your madness is getting worse.~
@27 = ~MT: She was once beautiful, but now she is ugly. I don't know what happened, she doesn't like to talk about it. I just know she thinks people always judge her by her looks. She won't talk to you because you are evil! You want to kill us all and burn our trees so she won't talk to you and I won't tell you how to talk to her! Get out of here!~ /*She used to be beautiful, but now she is ugly. I don't know what happened, since she doesn't like to talk about it. I just know that she thinks that people are always judging her by her looks. She won't talk to you because you're evil!*/
@28 = ~I'm not going to hurt you, now stop yelling at me.~
@29 = ~You can trust me dear. Why don't you tell me what you know?~
@30 = ~You tell me, or I'll chop your tree into kindling!~
@31 = ~MT: No, it's not like that now. Now my thoughts are clear. She was once beautiful, but now she is ugly. I don't know what happened, she doesn't like to talk about it. I just know she thinks people always judge her by her looks. She won't talk to you because you are evil! You want to kill us all and burn our trees so she won't talk to you and I won't tell you how to talk to her! Get out of here!~ /*She used to be beautiful, but now she is ugly. I don't know what happened, since she doesn't like to talk about it. I just know that she thinks that people are always judging her by her looks. She won't talk to you because you're evil!*/
@32 = ~MT: Oh,<LADYLORD> , I'm sorry. I just can't hold it in for long. I'll tell you what to do, but then leave. The Witch of Setara will give anything to regain her beauty. Once a nymph told me that they have something there, it makes people consider them beautiful. I don't know anything else, but you could probably get Setara interested in it.~ /*The witch Setara would give anything to have her looks restored. One day one of the nymphs told me that she had something that made people think they were beautiful. I don't know anymore than that, but you might be able to trick Setara with that.*/
@33 = ~Now please, let me go and you should leave, before I am overcome.~
@34 = ~MT: Oh, it's true. I'm sorry for yelling at you, it's just stronger than me. I'll tell you what can be done, but then you'll have to run. The Witch of Setara will give anything to regain her beauty. Once a nymph told me that they have something there, it makes people consider them beautiful. I don't know anything else, but you could probably get Setara interested in it.~ /*The witch Setara would give anything to have her looks restored. One day one of the nymphs told me that she had something that made people think they were beautiful. I don't know anymore than that, but you might be able to trick Setara with that.*/
@35 = ~No! You are just going to kill me and my tree. Stay away from me you horrible <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@36 = ~MT: Okay, okay, I'm sorry. Please don't touch my tree. I'll tell you what you can do. The Witch of Setara will give anything to regain her beauty. Once a nymph told me that they have something there, it makes people consider them beautiful. I don't know anything else, but you could probably get Setara interested in it.~ /*The witch Setara would give anything to have her looks restored. One day one of the nymphs told me that she had something that made people think they were beautiful. I don't know anymore than that, but you might be able to trick Setara with that.*/
@37 = ~The forest has returned to its natural state.~
