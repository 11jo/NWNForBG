@0 = ~Pardon me, but I have a lot of things to do.~
@1 = ~Good afternoon, this is Master Wanev's house and he's not here right now. I don't recognize you... May I ask who you are?~
@2 = ~No, you may not.~
@3 = ~Yes, please. We're criminals, the worst kind, so if you don't keep quiet, we'll have to kill you.~
@4 = ~We're here on behalf of Wanev, he asked us to bring him something.~
@5 = ~Oh, okay.~
@6 = ~P-please don't touch me, I'm just a lowly servant, I won't cause you any trouble.~
@7 = ~Uh, I don't remember my master... Oh, well, I'm sorry to bother you.~
@8 = ~I think you'll be a better master than the last one!~
