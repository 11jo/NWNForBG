@0 = ~MT: Welcome to the temple of Tyr - tell me, do you want Tyr's help, or perhaps Lady Luck herself sent you to us in these dark days? Don't you need something<BROTHERSISTER> ? I will help as far as I can.~ /*Welcome to the Tyrran Temple - tell me, are you here for Tyr's services, or perhaps the Lady Luck herself has guided you to us during these dark days?*/
@1 = ~Who are you? My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@2 = ~Perhaps you need some assistance?~
@3 = ~What services does Tyr provide?~
@4 = ~I'd like to make a purchase from the temple.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~MT: Then go, and may Fortune bless your every step.~ /*On your way, then, citizen.*/
@7 = ~Oh, pardon my manners, good <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME>. I am Neurik, the priest in charge of this Tyrran temple for good Port Llast.~
@8 = ~MT: Well,<BROTHERSISTER> , I will immediately enlighten you about all that Tyr can give you. Let me go into details. If you need healing scrolls or potions of any kind, then this is undoubtedly the best defense against all adversity ... If you need anything that can be useful to a representative of a loyal order, let me immediately assure you,<BROTHERSISTER> : You are in the right place.~ /*If you need anything that could be of use to one of the devoted order, well let me say right now, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>: you are in the right place.*/
@9 = ~Well... I'm hesitant to suggest the task because of the danger involved, but it's very important. You can be certain that I'll compensate you for the risk, should that matter to you.~
@10 = ~Tell me what you would have me do.~
@11 = ~Let's talk about something different.~
@12 = ~Have you a need, then, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>? I shall help however I am able.~
@13 = ~Of course, of course - do not let me keep you waiting. Tyr will wash his luck over you this day!~
@14 = ~MT: Let me tell you how it all began. Not so long ago, a vile creature settled near the city. In the beginning, few of us were aware of her presence. Indeed, for many years, Port Llast had seen little of such trouble. Gradually, however, we all learned. Several of our citizens have disappeared without a trace... and each time on a full moon night. Wolf tracks were found, howls were constantly heard ... we decided that the city was under siege. However, the trouble was not in a pack of wolves ... she came from a creature much stronger and more cunning: a werewolf. The famous hunter, Sir Caratis, went after him, having been ordered to kill this 'Black Wolf', as we called him.~ /*The trouble was from no pack of wolves, however... it came from a creature much more powerful and cunning: a werewolf. The famous hunter, Sir Karathis, was sent for with orders to slay this "Black Wolf" as we came to call it.*/
@15 = ~MT: Caratis took with him four youths from Port Llast to help him accomplish this feat, but, unfortunately, the Black Wolf knows no pity. He defeated the knight and attacked the boys... and only young Ender was able to return to us untouched. According to Ender, the other three boys were injured but managed to escape. I'm afraid this means the werewolf's curse was passed on to them. If the youths are not found and cured, or... or killed... we will face an even greater danger than the Black Wolf alone.~ /*According to Ander, the three other boys were wounded but had managed to flee. I fear that this means the curse of the werewolf will have been passed onto them. If the boys are not found and cured or... or killed... we could very well be facing even more danger than from the Black Wolf alone.*/
@16 = ~I have silver charms here which may yet drive the curse from their blood. You must subdue the beasts first, however, and convince them to use the charms... if you can. And then the Black Wolf, himself, must be dealt with. As I said... a terrible but vital task.~
@17 = ~I will do this for you.~
@18 = ~MT: Port Llast: The Werewolf Hunter Priest Newrick of Tyr, head of the temple at Port Llast, speaks of a terrible tragedy that has befallen several youths in the city. Sir Caratis Ironheart, an itinerant werewolf hunter, has hired four guys to help him capture the vicious lycanthrope known as the Black Wolf. However, this was a trap, as Sir Caratis was a Black Wolf himself. Its claws pierced the flesh of Bran, Urth, and Geth, turning them into werewolves. And only the youngest, Ender, managed to escape. Newrick believes that if these three youths are found quickly enough, they can be cured with amulets. Now Ender spends all his time in the Union Arms Tavern. Newrick recommends talking to this guy to find out where his friends might be hiding right now.~ /*Neurik, a priest of Tyr who presides of Port Llast's temple, warns of a terrible tragedy that has befallen some of the town's young men. Sir Karathis Ironheart, a travelling werewolf hunter, enlisted the help of four boys to hunt a foul lycanthrope known only as the Black Wolf. It was a trap, however, and Sir Karathis was himself the Black Wolf. His claws raked the flesh of Bran, Urth, and Geth, infecting them with his dread disease, leaving only the youngest boy, Ander, to escape. Neurik believes that, if found soon enough, the three young men may still be curable by a charm he has concocted. Ander currently spends his days at the Alliance Arms Inn, trying to spread news amongst adventurers of the tragedy that befell his friends. Neurik recommends speaking with the boy to gain an understanding of where those friends may now be hiding.*/
@19 = ~MT: I will think. Let me ask you something else.~ /*Let me ask about something else.*/
@20 = ~MT: You have no idea what a relief it is for me to hear that. Here, take the silver amulets. I hope with their help you can heal all three boys and Sir Caratis, if he is still alive. Each of the boys had a ring. If they are healed, they will willingly give them up. Bring them to me, and then I will understand that their condition has improved.~ /*You don't know how relieved I am here to hear that. Here, take the silver charms. Hopefully they can be used to cure all three boys and Sir Karathis, should he still live.*/
@21 = ~I have some more questions about this job.~
@22 = ~I'm certain of it. What I've told you would be much for anyone to absorb. What would you wish to know, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>?~
@23 = ~Where will I find these afflicted boys?~
@24 = ~Who is this Ander you mention?~
@25 = ~Where can I get the weapons to fight werewolves?~
@26 = ~The four of them - Bran, Geth, Urth, and Sir Karathis - are scattered about, and usually only to be found at night. Finding them will be difficult.~
@27 = ~Can you tell me anything about Bran?~
@28 = ~What do you know of Geth?~
@29 = ~Where might I find Urth?~
@30 = ~Do you know where Sir Karathis is?~
@31 = ~Let me ask about something else.~
@32 = ~MT: Of course, I will answer all your questions.~ /*I have questions I want answered.*/
@33 = ~MT: Ender is a young man who went out of his way to help others. They are so naive and trusting at this age... If you want to talk to him, you can find him at the Union Arms Hotel. However, keep in mind that he may still not have recovered from his experiences.~ /*If you care to speak with him, you'll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. Mind, however, that he's probably still shaken up from his experiences.*/
@34 = ~MT: I hope that such bloodshed will come only as a last resort. They are just innocent youths who are cursed. There is a merchant here who came to town hearing about our trouble... his name is Elchelor. You will find him at the Union Arms Hotel. He can provide you with silver-tipped arrows and other things. But please only use them if you have no other choice.~ /*I hope that it will come to such bloodletting only as a last resort. These are innocent lads under a curse. There is a peddler who came to town after hearing of our plight... his name is Alhelor.*/
@35 = ~MT: I heard he was last seen in the Charwood area, but exactly where I can't say. Please don't give up on your search for this. I'm sure luck will be on your side. Is there anything else you want to ask about boys? I feel so helpless... If only I had a better idea of where they could have gone...~ /*I've heard that he was last spotted in the Charwood area, though where, specifically, I could not say. Please don't let that dissuade you from looking. I'm sure luck will be on your side.*/
@36 = ~I know for fact that Geth traveled to the Neverwinter Wood. You know, he enjoyed being around people. I'd look for campgrounds or villages within the woods. He's sure to be close by.~
@37 = ~Urth, I'm afraid, could be anywhere. His family has been so very fearful for him and his whereabouts. To be unable to do something for their pain....~
@38 = ~Could I speak with his family?~
@39 = ~Yes, of course, the Eisenfeldts. Their farm is on the south end of Port Llast. Perhaps something they say will assist your search.~
@40 = ~Sir Karathis is a brave knight. Faced with his own corruption, I'm sure he would flee to the ends of the world. Perhaps if you can save the children, they will know where he might be.~
@41 = ~MT: Luck showed a miracle, and here you are again. With our brave boys slain by the Black Wolf, all we can do is hope desperately for your kindness. Do you have news for me<BROTHERSISTER> ? Or do you need something else?~ /*It's a miracle of luck to have you returned to us. After losing brave Sir Karathis to the Black Wolf, we can't help but be overly concerned with your welfare.*/
@42 = ~Alhelor is dead. I have his tooth, here.~
@43 = ~What exactly am I to do, again?~
@44 = ~I know the true identity of the Black Wolf, Neurik. It is Alhelor.~
@45 = ~I've not yet found Karathis or the Black Wolf.~
@46 = ~We must speak of the werewolves.~
@47 = ~Remind me what you needed help with...~
@48 = ~I have silver charms here which may yet drive the curse from their blood. You must subdue the beasts first, however, and convince them to use the charms... if you can. And then the Black Wolf, himself, must be dealt with. As I said... a terrible but vital task.~
@49 = ~It has been a dark day for Port Llast, but you have reminded us that the sun rises yet again. For the champion of Port Llast, here is a token of our gratitude.~
@50 = ~Thank you for this. Farewell.~
@51 = ~MT: Port Llast: Werewolf hunter Newrick, a priest of Tyr from a temple in Port Llast, spoke of a tragedy that befell several young residents of the city. Sir Caratis Ironheart, an itinerant werewolf hunter, has asked four boys to help him hunt down a dreaded lycanthrope. In the caves east of the Green Gryphon Inn, he was ambushed and infected himself. This drove him crazy, he attacked the boys, fortunately, he did not manage to kill them on the spot. Sir Caratis told us the name of the black wolf: Elchelor, the trader who sells werewolf remedies at the Union Arms Inn. Elchelor learned the latest rumors and fled the tavern. However, he was found at his home and killed on the spot. Newrick gratefully accepted Elchelor's tooth as proof that this tragic story had a happy ending.~ /*It appears that Sir Karathis Ironheart was not the Black Wolf after all. He entered the caves east of the Green Griffon Inn and was ambushed and infected himself. Maddened with the bloodlust of his unexpected transformation, he lashed out at the boys who had joined him in the hunt but luckily was able to refrain from killing them outright. Worse yet, Sir Karathis has given him a familiar name: Alhelor, the merchant who sold anti-lycanthropic supplies at Ander's side in Port Llast's Alliance Arms Inn. Luckily Ander was discovered safe and sound, though Alhelor had caught wind of the recent news and fled the inn. He was tracked down to his home, however, and finally killed. Neurik, the town priest, grateful accepted Alhelor's tooth as evidence that the tragedy has finally been put to rest.*/
@52 = ~Port Llast can thank me better than this, aye?~
@53 = ~Port Llast is indebted to you <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME> - our brave champion. Travel safely, and know that our thoughts are with you on this journey of yours.~
@54 = ~Oh? Ah... of course, of course. Here, I had some gold bundled aside, but it would be better spent going into your pockets. Forgive us for withholding this paltry sum.~
@55 = ~The people of Port Llast can only give so much. To ask more of them would be... please, be content with what you have.~
@56 = ~MT: Put an end to all this... this curse that haunts us in the form of the Black Wolf. I do not know why this creature chose to live among us under the guise of Elchelor, but his atrocities must be stopped. How many have died, how many lives have been broken because of him? Get, Bran, Urt... not to mention the valiant knight, Sir Caratis. I won't let this continue... find Elchelor and put an end to his existence, I beg you!~ /*How many have died, or had their lives destroyed because of him? Geth, Bran, Urth... as well as the noble knight, Sir Karathis. I will permit this to go no further... find Alhelor and end his life, I beg you!*/
@57 = ~I will do as you ask.~
@58 = ~Will there be a reward for this task, too?~
@59 = ~I cannot accept this job now.~
@60 = ~MT: Are you kidding me? Elchelor? But he - in that case, I... can hardly bring myself to say it. But it must be... destroyed. The curse of the Black Wolf must be ended so that it never again touches the innocent. I hate to ask you this, but will you find Elchelor to do what needs to be done? I ask you to,<BROTHERSISTER> ...do this and bring me his tooth, so that I know once and for all that the danger is over.~ /*I wish I need not ask it of you, but would you seek out Alhelor and do what must be done? Please, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>... do this and bring me his tooth so that I will know once and for all that the danger is over.*/
@61 = ~I know I can trust you. Your efforts have been... far beyond anything we could have hoped for. End it quickly, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. Let Tyr guide your hand in the name of justice.~
@62 = ~MT: Port Llast: The Werewolf Hunter It turns out that Sir Caratis is not the Black Wolf at all. In the caves east of the Green Gryphon Inn, he was ambushed and infected himself. This drove him crazy, he attacked the boys, but, fortunately, he did not manage to kill them on the spot. Newrick, the priest of Tyr from Port Llast, was saddened by this news. Even if Sir Caratis is innocent, the terrible Black Wolf still roams free. Moreover, from the diary of Sir Caratis, we learned his name: this is Elchelor, a merchant who sells werewolf remedies with Ender in the Union Arms tavern. The boy's life is in great danger, so Newrick gave the order to immediately find and destroy Elchelor. He would like to see Elchelor's tooth, which will serve as proof of his death.~ /*It appears that Sir Karathis Ironheart is not the Black Wolf after all. He entered the caves east of the Green Griffon Inn and was ambushed and infected himself. Maddened with the bloodlust of his unexpected transformation, he lashed out at the boys who had joined him in the hunt but luckily was able to refrain from killing them outright. Neurik, the Tyrist priest back in Port Llast was chagrined to learn that, even with the situation of Sir Karathis addressed, the dreaded Black Wolf remains on the loose. Worse yet, Sir Karathis has given him a familiar name: Alhelor, the merchant selling anti-lycanthropic supplies at Ander's side in Port Llast's Alliance Arms Inn. The boy's life is in great danger and Neurik has given the order to find and destroy Alhelor at once.*/
@63 = ~It goes without saying that I would reward you for the task... but only if you return with a tooth of the beast. I must be sure that the deed is done.~
@64 = ~I wish you would say otherwise, though it is wrong for me to do so... should you change your mind I'll be here, and so will your reward. I hope you'll reconsider.~
@65 = ~MT: I have no fear for your success in this test. Time may not be on our side, but luck is with us. I know it. In that case, do you need anything<BROTHERSISTER> ? I will help as far as I can.~ /*I have no fear that you will do well in this endeavour. Time might not be on our side, but luck is. I know it.*/
@66 = ~A grim topic, though I find I can think of little else. Have you been successful?~
@67 = ~I've some questions about the boys you wish cured.~
@68 = ~I've had some success in finding the boys, actually.~
@69 = ~"I want to ask something else."~
@70 = ~MT: Certainly,<BROTHERSISTER> I will answer all your questions.~ /*Want questions answered now.*/
@71 = ~I've heard that he was last spotted in the Charwood area, though where, specifically, I could not say. Please don't let that dissuade you from looking. I'm sure luck will be on your side.~
@72 = ~Truly! I had little doubt that you would do well. Oh, Port Llast is lucky indeed to have you in its midst.~
@73 = ~I found all three of them. Here are their rings.~
@74 = ~I found Urth. Here is his ring.~
@75 = ~I found Bran. Here is his ring.~
@76 = ~I found Geth. Here is his ring.~
@77 = ~MT: What a wonderful fortune to visit Port Llast! What a wonderful hero came to our aid! You managed to survive and bring our children out of the door of death! Now all the boys have returned to us. What a relief to see that peace, at least in part, has finally returned to the city. Your heroism helped us a lot,<BROTHERSISTER> . Please accept my thanks.~ /*All the boys have now been accounted for. It is a relief to see that some measure of peace has been restored at last. Your heroism has served us well, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. Take this reward, and my thanks.*/
@78 = ~If only all of this were over with. Sir Karathis remains at large... as does the Black Wolf, himself. The task yet remains to track them both, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>. You will, of course, be rewarded once again when that is done, I assure you.~
@79 = ~MT: I understand. It's a pity that not all the boys managed to be kept alive, isn't it? Although this loss is regrettable, our request was granted, and you are not to be blamed. We are all grateful to you.~ /*I see. The curse has taken the life of the young lad, has it? Sad though the loss might be, you have done what was asked of you and cannot be faulted. We are all grateful.*/
@80 = ~MT: They say that saving a single life is a sign of good luck for all of us. Port-Llast will always love young Urth, both as a reminder and out of respect for your feat. We need to find the other boys.~ /*It's said that if but one life can be spared, then we have all been touched with luck. Port Llast will give its love to young Urth, both in remembrance, and to honor your deeds.*/
@81 = ~MT: Any day marked by death must be sad for everyone, as sad as it is for Urth. Port Llast will always remember young Urth. We need to find the other boys.~ /*Any day that is touched with death must be a sad one, as it is for Urth. Truly, however. we are blessed to have witnessed two lives kept from that same death by your able hands.*/

@90 = ~I can only hope that your appearance here suggests that you have heard our pleading, and that you intend to end Alhelor where we could not. Tell me, is my hope proven true?~
@91 = ~<PRO_BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME> - how... how do things progress? Is Alhelor - the Black Wolf - dead? I don't think a single soul within Port Llast has stopped to take breath.~
@92 = ~Port Llast is seeing its mysteries resolved - the werewolf forms of Urth, Bran, and Geth are no longer. But still - there's no news on Karathis or the Black Wolf. Is there anything you know, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>?~
@93 = ~Welcome back, my <PRO_BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME>. It's my pleasure, as always, to welcome you to Tyr's temple, now that things are as they belong in Port Llast.~

Neurik, the Tyrist priest back in Port Llast will be chagrined to learn that, even with the situation of Sir Karathis addressed, the dreaded Black Wolf remains on the loose. Worse yet, Sir Karathis has given him a familiar name: Alhelor, the merchant selling anti-lycanthropic supplies at Ander's side in Port Llast's Alliance Arms Inn. The boy's life is in great danger and it is imperative that this news be reported to Neurik at once.~
