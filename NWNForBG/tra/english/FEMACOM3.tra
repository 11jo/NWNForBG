@0 = ~Why are you here in my home? Please leave.~
@1 = ~I am in service to Aribeth and the city guard.~
@2 = ~I just need to ask a few questions.~
@3 = ~MT: Я иду, куда хочу.~ /*I'm looking for work.*/
@4 = ~I will leave.~
@5 = ~That doesn't mean you can invade my home... does it? I'll answer your questions, but I would like you to leave afterward.~
@6 = ~I need infomation about Neverwinter.~
@7 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@8 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@9 = ~Goodbye.~
@10 = ~You can't just barge into peoples' homes and question them! What right do you have to do that?~
@11 = ~And I am supposed to accept this? What do you want from me? Why bother with my little home?~
@12 = ~Homes have people, and people have gold!~
@13 = ~Thank you. If times were better I might welcome... visitors, but not now.~
@14 = ~I'm not sure what you are asking about. It's a big city.~
@15 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@16 = ~What do you know about the leaders of Neverwinter?~
@17 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@18 = ~Please, don't speak of it in my home. I've been lucky enough to avoid it and I don't wish to tempt the fates.~
@19 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@20 = ~Not really. All I hear of is the plague and the death. It's almost too much. I don't want to know if there's anything else going on.~
@21 = ~Farewell. Please leave my home as you found it.~
@22 = ~Not me. I've already been threatened and stolen from. I've nothing left to give, so say what you've come to say and get out!~
@23 = ~This is about gold? The air is thick with plague, people are dying in the streets, and you want gold? Tell me you are not so repugnant as this!~
@24 = ~Shut up! Hand over your gold or I'll kill you!~
@25 = ~I am sorry. I am actually a guard in service to Aribeth.~
@26 = ~MT: Ну, я живу в Сердце города и почти не выбираюсь оттуда. Есть четыре других района, но мне незачем ходить туда. Это Гнездо Нищих, район порта, полуостров и Черное озеро. О них я могу немного рассказать.~ /*Well, I live in the City Core, so I don't get around much. There's four other districts, but I don't have much cause to visit them.*/
@27 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@28 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@29 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@30 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@31 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula district.~
@32 = ~Oh, I don't know much about that sort of thing. Lord Nasher keeps the city peaceful and that's good enough for me. He's a good man.~
@33 = ~How has Lord Nasher dealt with the plague?~
@34 = ~MT: Хорошо, я поговорю с вами. Надеюсь, это не займет много времени?~ /*I'll answer one of your questions... if it doesn't take long.*/
@35 = ~The Helmites claim their blessings are a cure. I don't know. Everyday I see a few less of my neighbors around.~
@36 = ~MT: Ну, его сейчас почти не видно. Замок Невер заперт, чтобы туда не проникла чума. Уверен, он делает все, что в его силах. Наверное, за него теперь леди Арибет. Хорошая женщина. Держит народ под контролем.~ /*Well, we don't see much of him now. Castle Never is locked up so he doesn't get the plague. I'm sure he's doing all he can.*/
@37 = ~How has Lady Aribeth dealt with the plague?~
@38 = ~MT: О, она не знает усталости. Она все организует и... заботится об умерших. Должно быть, эта работа ужасно ее угнетает. Стражников не хватает, знаете ли. Хельмиты подменяют их, наверное, но я не знаю точно, чем они занимаются.~ /*Oh, she is tireless. She's been organizing and... taking care of the dead. It must be a terribly straining job for her.*/
@39 = ~Don't! Please! I just want to live through the plague... I just want to live... take my gold... take whatever... just get out.~
@40 = ~Why? That's where you are now. Couldn't you just walk around? Did you have to break into my home to learn that?~
@41 = ~Oh, the poorest of the districts. They got the worst of the plague, and I even heard there were undead rising up all over. Can you imagine?~
@42 = ~I hear it's a busy place, but I guess it's pretty rough. Lots of transients come in on the ships. Pirates too.~
@43 = ~I wish I could tell you about the Blacklake. I wouldn't be able to get the time of day from the people that live there. Stuffy nobles.~
@44 = ~I wouldn't know anything about the Peninsula district. Good people stay away from it. That's where the prison is.~
@45 = ~It's the poorest district. I don't give it much thought, really. Makes me feel bad, especially with it hit so hard by the Wailing.~
@46 = ~I guess one of the new militia recruits got rid of them all, but still... zombies! I can't imagine...~
@47 = ~MT: Похоже, там теперь повсюду воры, и еще начался какой-то бунт среди Кровавых Моряков.~ /*I sense there is tension between your people and the Lords' Alliance.*/
@48 = ~Normally I wouldn't know anything about the Docks, but everyone is talking about how one of the new militia recruits went toe to toe with old Vengaul Bloodsail!~
@49 = ~I'm not even looking in the direction of the Blacklake anymore. I heard one of them stuffy nobles was hoarding food away from us that need it!~
@50 = ~MT: Я даже и не смотрю в сторону Черного Озера. Говорят, кто-то из этих жадных богатеев копит запасы продовольствия и скрывает их от нас, от тех, кто в них нуждается! Думается мне, кто-то положил этому конец, но это их не извиняет. Ненавижу этих надутых сквалыг!~ /*I'm not even looking in the direction of the Blacklake anymore. I heard one of them stuffy nobles was hoarding food away from us that need it!*/
@51 = ~I heard some strange things about the Peninsula district and the prison there. I heard it had to be cleaned out by the militia because the Head Gaoler went insane!~
@52 = ~MT: Поговаривают, странные вещи творились на полуострове и в тамошней тюрьме. Говорят даже, городская стража ее вычистила, потому что главный надзиратель с ума сошел! Думаю, там сейчас стало поспокойнее, но я даже и знать не хочу, в чем дело у них было. У меня своих забот полон рот.~ /*I heard some strange things about the Peninsula district and the prison there. I heard it had to be cleaned out by the militia because the Head Gaoler went insane!*/
@53 = ~Yes? Is there something else you need? I had hoped my previous answers were enough and you'd leave.~
@54 = ~What are we coming to? Threatened in my own home! Thief! Bandit! Get out of here!~
