@0 = ~Hello there. All of nature's creatures are welcome to this grove. How can I help you?~ [AAVIL054]
@1 = ~Can I ask who you are?~
@2 = ~What is this place?~
@3 = ~What exactly is it you do here?~
@4 = ~I am the Archdruid Aawill and you are <CHARNAME>.~
@5 = ~How do you know that?~
@6 = ~Nope. That's not my name.~
@7 = ~NP: I am Archdruid Aavil, and you are an associate of <CHARNAME>.~ /*I am the Archdruid Aawill and you are <CHARNAME>.*/
@8 = ~NP: Uh-uh. I'm not familiar with that name.~ /*Nope. That's not my name.*/
@9 = ~This is a druid grove. Here, those who truly revere nature gather to discuss, to contemplate, to learn, and even to challenge nature. Usually there are more of us here, but several of our members have gone missing.~
@10 = ~What kinds of things do you discuss and learn about?~
@11 = ~What do you mean 'challenge' nature?~
@12 = ~What you mean some missing?~
@13 = ~Yes, well... nature bores me. Goodbye.~
@14 = ~NP: The wind took your name from your lips and passed it to the trees, and they whispered it to me. Now, what can I do for you?~ /*The wind stole your name from your lips and carried it to the trees, who whispered it to me.*/
@15 = ~NP: Nature doesn't lie to its allies. So, what can I do for you?~ /*Nature doesn't lie to her allies.*/
@16 = ~NP: The wind took that name from your lips and passed it to the trees, and they whispered it to me. Now, what can I do for you?~ /*The wind stole your name from your lips and carried it to the trees, who whispered it to me.*/
@17 = ~NP: There are many different philosophical teachings about nature that we usually argue about, but right now the talk is mostly about the missing druids. It's a long story, but I sense that you <MALEFEMALE> are of the fidgety breed, so I'll try to keep it brief.~ /*There are many different philosophies about nature, which we spend time arguing, but right now the topic has mainly centered on the missing druids.*/
@18 = ~Thank you.~
@19 = ~NP: I don't care.~ /*I don't care.*/
@20 = ~Nature is always competitive. We try ourselves in contests against one another, but only druids are allowed to participate in these rites.~
@21 = ~What did you mean when you said some of you went missing?~
@22 = ~I am sad to hear that. If you would like to know how you could help restore the natural order, please return and speak to me again.~
@23 = ~It is a long story, but I sense that you are a <PRO_MANWOMAN> of action, so I shall try to be brief.~
@24 = ~NP: Until recently, this forest had been a relatively peaceful place. The forest nymphs protected the animals, and everything followed the natural order. But now there is a terrible discord. The animals have become overly aggressive, attacking anyone they see, including those who have always been on friendly terms with nature.~ /*But now something has gone terribly wrong. The creatures have become overly aggressive, attacking anyone they lay eyes on, including those who are considered friends of nature.*/
@25 = ~You mean rangers and druids are being attacked?~
@26 = ~I guess they finally get to see what everyone experiences in the wild.~
@27 = ~NP: We can't even seem to talk to the animals anymore. From the way they think, they've all gone mad. They want nothing more than to destroy. I think there's something wrong with the Spirit of the Forest.~ /*We can't even seem to communicate with the animals. It is like their minds have been driven mad. They simply want to destroy.*/
@28 = ~What is wrong with the Spirit?~
@29 = ~What is the Spirit of the Wood?~
@30 = ~Yes, nature has her ferocious side, but she has a tender side too. It is that side which seems to have disappeared.~
@31 = ~NP: The Spirit of the Forest can call those who live in the forest to its defense. Now it attacks even those who would defend it themselves. I don't know what's wrong with the Spirit, but apparently it's causing the animals to pounce on anything that comes along. I need someone to figure out what's going on, though Spirit will undoubtedly try to kill him.~ /*I do not know what is wrong with the Spirit, but it is obvious that it is using the creatures to strike out at anything foreign. I need someone to find out what is wrong, even though the Spirit will surely try to kill that person.*/
@32 = ~I think I can handle that.~
@33 = ~What's in it for me if I decide to do this?~
@34 = ~NP: Maybe later, for now I have too much to do.~ /*I think I'm a little busy right now.*/
@35 = ~NP: The spirit of the Forest is a difficult concept to explain. Forest is not just a group of trees, it is a living being. The Spirit is the center of the Forest's protective power. It has a mind. of sorts. although it doesn't really reason like you or me. It cares for the creatures that live here, maintaining the natural cycles that include life and death.~ /*It has a mind... of sorts... though it really doesn't think like either of us. It cares for the creatures that live here, maintaining the circle of existence that includes life and death.*/
@36 = ~So what is wrong with it then?~
@37 = ~I don't understand that at all.~
@38 = ~NP: Okay, let me try to explain it to you like this. Your body is alive and your brain controls it. The forest is like the body, and the spirit is like the brain. So, if you want to nail a mosquito, your brain tells your hand what to do. If Spirit wants to stop a greedy logger, he can tell the bear to attack him. Do you understand?~ /*So, if you want to swat a mosquito, your mind tells your hand what to do. If the Spirit wants to stop a greedy woodcutter, it might tell a bear to go attack him. Understand?*/
@39 = ~No. I still don't understand.~
@40 = ~The wood is alive and it's acting in a way it never has before!~
@41 = ~Oh, okay.~
@42 = ~This is not a responsibility to be taken on lightly. I dare not send someone who is only partially committed to the task.~
@43 = ~I swear I shall do my best to save the Wood.~
@44 = ~Yeah, yeah, enough with the speeches. I said I would take the job.~
@45 = ~Maybe you should find someone else. I'm rather busy.~
@46 = ~That is unfortunate, but nature always finds a way to balance herself. I am sure someone of tougher mettle will come along soon.~
@47 = ~NP: I can see that you lack respect and awareness of the importance of this task. Perhaps if you give it some thought, I can trust you with this responsibility. Please come back when you understand.~ /*I find your attitude lacking and unappreciative of the importance of this mission. Perhaps if you can gain an appropriate perspective, I could charge you with this trust.*/
@48 = ~NP: In that case, I thank you for your help. There are two tasks that need to be accomplished. The first is to find out what's going on with the Spirit of the Forest. The second is to find the missing druids. Since they were on the same mission as you, they may have information that can help you with the first.~ /*The second is to find the missing druids. As the druids were on the same mission as you, it is possible that they might be able to provide you with information you need to complete your primary task.*/
@49 = ~If you can help me save the Spirit, I can pay you 500 gp. For each of the druids you rescue, I will give you 300 gp. Is there anything else I can help you with?~
@50 = ~What are the names of the missing druids?~
@51 = ~Where were the druids last seen?~
@52 = ~NP: I understand. Goodbye.~ /*I must leave. Farewell.*/
@53 = ~I see that you do indeed have proper instincts for this job. The missing druids include Orlane, Bree and Terari.~
@54 = ~They entered the deep woods and that is the last anyone has seen of them. Nothing more is known about their location.~
@55 = ~NP: Silvanus be with you, my child. You may enter the forest, I will remove the protective runes on the bridge.~ /*Silvanus goes with you my child.*/

@57 = ~Ah, a fellow child of nature. Be welcome here. How may I be of service?~ [AAVIL053]
@58 = ~You have returned. What can I help you with?~ [AAVIL052]
@59 = ~Tell me what you need assistance with again.~
@60 = ~I would like to help you.~
@61 = ~NP: Isn't this one of your druids? He introduced himself as Orlaine.~ /*Is this one of your druids?*/
@62 = ~NP: I found a woman named Bree who claims to be a druid.~ /*I met a half-orc named Glendir, who claims to be your brother.*/
@63 = ~NP: Is Terari not what you're looking for?~ /*What were you looking for, then?*/
@64 = ~NP: I found all the druids. They're back?~ /*He's probably not coming back.*/
@65 = ~Nothing. Goodbye.~
@66 = ~Something is wrong with the Spirit of the Wood. Also, some druids are missing. I need help with both problems.~
@67 = ~Goodbye.~
@68 = ~NP: Steady Orleans is back. How wonderful to have him back in our circle. Here's your 1,000 gold pieces.~ /*Steadfast Orlane has returned. It is good to have him back in the circle. Here is your 300 gold, <CHARNAME>.*/
@69 = ~NP: We are happy to welcome back our dear Bree. Here's your 1,000 gold pieces.~ /*We were overjoyed to welcome back dear Bree. Here is your 300 gold, <CHARNAME>.*/
@70 = ~NP: The Grove welcomes the return of my dear friend Terari. Here is your 1,000 gold pieces.~ /*My dear friend Terari's return was welcomed by the grove. Here is your 300 gold, <CHARNAME>.*/
@71 = ~NP: How wonderful! The Grove welcomes back its brethren, Orlaine, Terari, and our dear Bree. Here's your 3,000 gold pieces.~ /*My dear friend Terari's return was welcomed by the grove. Here is your 300 gold, <CHARNAME>.*/
@72 = ~I see you are back. Have you had any luck?~ [AAVIL055]
@73 = ~What are the names of the druids?~
@74 = ~I have cured the Spirit of the Wood.~
@75 = ~The Spirit of the Wood is dead.~
@76 = ~No. Goodbye.~
@77 = ~NP: These druids are Orlaine, a halfling; Bree, a human; and Terari, an elf. I hope you find them quickly. Silvanus be with you.~ /*The druids are Orlane, a halfling; Bree, a human; and Terari, an elf. I hope you find them soon.*/
@78 = ~NP: Beautiful work, <CHARNAME>. Now that the Spirit of the Forest has been healed, we can restore our unity with nature and its creatures without fear of sacrifice. Here is the 5,000 gold I promised earlier.~ /*You have done very well, <PRO_GIRLBOY>. With the Spirit of the Wood cured, we can return to our union with nature and her creatures without fear of destruction.*/
@79 = ~I am happy to have been of service. Thank you for your generosity.~
@80 = ~NP: I almost died to save your precious Spirit! I think that's worth more than 5,000 gold pieces.~ /*I had to die to save your precious Spirit! I think such a sacrifice should be worth a little more than 500 gold.*/
@81 = ~NP: You give me more gold or I'll set fire to your precious forest!~ /*You will give me more than 500 gold pieces or maybe I'll set fire to your precious forest!*/
@82 = ~NP: Restoring balance in nature is reward enough. Better to give that money to the poor.~ /*Restoring the balance of nature is reward enough for me. Give the 500 gold pieces to the poor instead.*/
@83 = ~Alas, that is a great loss to all of nature. The forest will never be the same again. Was it truly necessary for all to come to this?~
@84 = ~I am sorry for nature's loss, but there were no other choices open to me.~
@85 = ~Hey, you win some, you lose some. Either way I still expect to get paid.~
@86 = ~Good luck to you my child. May the blessings of Silvanus go with you.~

@88 = ~I suppose you did give your all to the task. I guess I could give you an extra 100 gold.~
@89 = ~There are more rewards in serving nature than just gold. I have paid you what we agreed upon. Be content with what you are given and nature will reward you with a happier Spirit.~
@90 = ~I suppose that nature has both its gentle creatures and its savage beasts. Although I hardly fear your threats, I will give you an extra 100 gold, since this quest has obviously unbalanced you.~
@91 = ~NP: May the glory of Sylvanus shine upon your blessed heart. Nature will never forget your generous soul.~ /*May the glory of Silvanus shine on your blessed heart <PRO_LADYLORD>. Nature will surely remember your generous spirit.*/
@92 = ~Even that is hard to accept. There will be great suffering in the forest without the protection of the Spirit. I can only give you 250 gold, as the rest shall have to go toward helping the forest survive.~
@93 = ~NP: I understand. Please accept my apologies and my thanks for this gold.~ /*I understand. Please accept my apology and my gratitude for what you could give.*/
@94 = ~NP: Saving the forest is more important than the reward. Keep all the gold.~ /*Saving the forest is more important than a reward. Take all of the gold and do what you can.*/
@95 = ~No! We had a deal and you had better stick with it or else!~
@96 = ~With such a callous attitude, I can see I should never have allowed you to enter the forest. I will still pay you, but only 300 gold, as the rest shall go toward helping the forest survive.~
@97 = ~You obviously did what you thought you had to. I hope you do better in future endeavors.~

@99 = ~I thank you for your concern and generosity. Somehow nature will find a balance and continue on.~
@100 = ~Or else what? Will you challenge the might of the entire circle of druids and all the forces of nature we can bring to bear? I think not. Now take your blood money and leave this place.~
@101 = ~Nature thanks you for all you have done. Go with her blessing and mine.~ [AAVIL051]
@102 = ~The forest will never be the same.~ [AAVIL050]
