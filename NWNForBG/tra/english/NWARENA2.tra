@0 = ~What? Why would I talk to you? You've got no medals. Feh!~
@1 = ~At least tell me about the fighters.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~NP: A newcomer wants to know about the fighters? Ha! Why? To get a rank, you must first defeat the mighty Hrask - only then will you be appreciated! Hrask has a fire axe, you know? It'll burn your hair off. Even the shortest hair!~ /*A newcomer wants to know about the fighters? HA! Like it matters! You'd have to beat the mighty Hrusk and his pet before you're even ranked!*/
@4 = ~What about the others?~
@5 = ~That's right, goodbye. As if I've got time for no-medals like you. Beat it.~
@6 = ~Go away. I'm done talking to your worthless butt.~
@7 = ~Hey there! You are doing pretty good! You got a good medal on you!~
@8 = ~What do you know about the fighters?~
@9 = ~You watch a lot of the fights. Are they fair?~
@10 = ~NP: Fasshi should be fought in the second round. He's a little guy, but he's a little guy! He's a terrific guy. You can't cut him or stab him. He's always so focused. But he does get bruised a lot. I've noticed that. He's vulnerable, too.~ /*You just can't cut him or poke him. He's so focussed. He bruises though. I noticed that. He's not invulnerable.*/
@11 = ~What about the Third Round?~
@12 = ~NP: Of course. I mean, everyone has their own special skill, but you can learn about all that before the battle. Ask around. Except Clodus. He's nothing special, but he's impossible to defeat. He's so strong.~ /*Oh, sure. I mean, each guy has a specialty and a pet, but that's all known before a fight begins, if you ask around.*/
@13 = ~Sure. See you. Good luck! You're great!~
@14 = ~NP: Agar should be fought for a medal in the third round. He's strong, he's got pretty good armor, well, like everyone else, and something else not good. He's got a poison weapon. People complained at first, but then they got used to it. Still, he's strong, he's appreciated here.~ /*Agar is the Third Round Medal fight. He's real tough. He's got a pet, like everyone else, and he's got something nasty too.*/
@15 = ~What about Claudus?~
@16 = ~Don't worry about that. You won't get to him. The others are plenty tough, but Claudus is just plain scary.~
@17 = ~NP: It's you! It's <CHARNAME>! I love you! I mean, I love the way you fight! You defeated Fashi! And Agar himself! I can't believe I'm talking to you. I mean, maybe you're used to being the medal-less rookie, but now! Just think about it!~ /*I can't believe I'm talking to you. I mean, sure, maybe you used to be a no-medals, but look at you now! WOW!*/
@18 = ~What do you know about Claudus?~
@19 = ~Go away, kid, you bother me.~
@20 = ~Thank you. Farewell.~
@21 = ~NP: Claudus? He, the great one, he's invincible! How... I don't know who is! It's like he's invincible! Some people complain that he's so strong, but they're no match for him. It's fair, isn't it? He fights with regular enchanted weapons without any stuff like fire or poison. He seems to be a super fighter by nature!~ /*Claudus? He's just great! It's like... I don't know! It's like he's almost invulnerable! Some people complain that he's so good, but they just can't compete.*/
@22 = ~NP: Hmm. When she gets her medals, she starts to turn her nose up. But the way she fights. It's amazing!~ /*Me do what Kurth want... but he still no let her go.*/
@23 = ~NP: Thank you! She says thank you! Me! Everybody hear?! Crazy!~ /*Thanks! <PRO_HESHE> said thanks! To me! Everyone see that?! Damn right!*/
@24 = ~NP: Unbelievable! <CHARNAME> the best! The best! That was great!~ /*I can't believe it!  is just the best! The BEST! That was great!*/
