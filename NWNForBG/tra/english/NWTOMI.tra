@0 = ~Why, hullo there! You have the smell of a prospective employer about you, m'<LADYLORD>. Not that it's easy to smell anything with all the burning corpses in this city, mind you. Never seen this many flies outside of a Calimshite alehouse.~ [NWTOM051]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~That's a horrible thing to say!~
@3 = ~Aren't you frightened of the plague?~
@4 = ~I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Me? Why, I'm none other than the renowned rogue, Tomi Undergallows! "Grin" to my friends, "Tomi Grin" to the lasses, and "that damned halfling" to anyone in a position of respectable authority. I can forgive you for not having heard of me, however. I hail most recently from Calimport... and that's a long way for even my reputation to travel. I give it another week, personally.~ /*Me? Why, I'm none other than the renowned rogue, Tomi Undergallows! "Grin" to my friends, "Tomi Grin" to the lasses, and "that damned halfling" to anyone in a position of respectable authority.*/
@6 = ~What do you do around here?~
@7 = ~Do you always talk this much?~
@8 = ~Running from your reputation, are you?~
@9 = ~That's quite a long way to travel.~
@10 = ~Oh, I don't think the Calimshites would mind, m'<LADYLORD>. The way they dress, it be a kindness to talk instead about their foul ale.~
@11 = ~What does that mean?~
@12 = ~Oh, to be honest, m'<LADYLORD>, I be far more frightened to take a swig of Calimshite ale. You'd be lucky to wake up three days later hugging the back end of a camel, I'd wager.~
@13 = ~Oops! I hear that's the first sign of the plague. Tsk. If you don't die some wretched death, m'<LADYLORD>, come back sometime and we'll make a deal, aye?~
@14 = ~I could ask you the same question, now, couldn't I? Well... if you hafta know the truth, I was being chased by a pack of hooligans the day before yesterday when I darted in here. It seems like as good a place as any... 'specially considering the priests don't throw halflings out on their ears as a policy, like in Calimport... so I've been hanging about looking for something to do.~ /*It seems like as good a place as any... 'specially considering the priests don't throw halflings out on their ears as a policy, like in Calimport... so I've been hanging about looking for something to do.*/
@15 = ~Unless you're sneaking up for a good backstab or in the sack with a pretty miss, I really don't see the need for restraint. Silence is for the dead... although I hear they can be a bit chatty, too, at times.~
@16 = ~Well, you strike me as a bit of a rogue yourself, m'<LADYLORD>. Sometimes a reputation deserves to be run from, aye? Like a giant ogre with big feet and poor eyesight.~
@17 = ~Nothing too wrong with having a bit of a reputation, m'<LADYLORD>. Keeps the flies from settling, if you know what I mean. If the heat gets too high, you just step out of the kitchen, right?~
@18 = ~You know how it goes, I'm sure. Rob some over-fat human caliph with piggy lips, kiss his daughter as a lark before you escape with the loot, and suddenly you're the most wanted man in Calimshan. How was I supposed to know that he was so sensitive about his daughter? I still say it was worth it. That took flair, and I have flair! Too bad Neverwinter didn't treat me any better, at first.~ /*You know how it goes, I'm sure. Rob some over-fat human caliph with piggy lips, kiss his daughter as a lark before you escape with the loot, and suddenly you're the most wanted man in Calimshan.*/
@19 = ~He hunted you for kissing his daughter?~
@20 = ~What happened then?~
@21 = ~Heh... it means I be bloody glad to be out of Calimshan and anywhere else, even here! Now, about that employer business...~
@22 = ~Well, I use the word "kissing" loosely, m'<LADYLORD>. Trouble was, the lass was set to marry the Pasha's son... so long as she was a virgin. Ah, well.~
@23 = ~Neverwinter seemed a fine enough city for an enterprising young halfling like myself... on the surface, anyway. You'd be surprised at what people get away with, here. They can take a perfectly innocent man, accuse him of simple pickpocketing, and throw him in prison without even so much as a trial. Or not a very fair one, anyway. That judge was mean.~ /*They can take a perfectly innocent man, accuse him of simple pickpocketing, and throw him in prison without even so much as a trial. Or not a very fair one, anyway. That judge was mean.*/
@24 = ~Fortunately, my stay in Neverwinter's fine prison system was a short one. I didn't arrange for my escape, oddly enough, but I was glad for it nevertheless.~
@25 = ~So you're a convict, then?~
@26 = ~How did you escape the prison?~
@27 = ~I'm looking for a good rogue to help me in my mission.~
@28 = ~Technically, I suppose I am. Trust me, however: they have so many other things to worry about in that prison, even if they thought I wasn't dead they wouldn't trouble with me.~
@29 = ~Why do you say that? What trouble?~
@30 = ~I'm not about to deal with a convict!~
@31 = ~The exact goings-on within the prison I'm not entirely aware of, m'<LADYLORD>. To tell the truth, I had only been in the prison for a few days and was just starting to think about how depressing life was when it all began. The warden of the place began babbling some nonsense and started releasing all the prisoners. Even the truly despicable types: murderers, politicians, lawyers, you name it.~ /*The exact goings-on within the prison I'm not entirely aware of, m'<LADYLORD>. To tell the truth, I had only been in the prison for a few days and was just starting to think about how depressing life was when it all began.*/
@32 = ~Oh? A mission, is it? My little pinky toes are quivering with curiosity! Or is that my danger sense? Hmm... that would go a long way toward explaining my recklessness. Oh well. What kind of mission are you on?~
@33 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that might be used to find a plague cure.~
@34 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@35 = ~Considering my profession, that's quite a fine line you draw there. Have it your way, however. If you change your mind, we'll chat again.~
@36 = ~I left the area quickly, of course, and wound up here at the temple... nice safe place t' be. Last I heard, them prisoners were all tearing up the Peninsula district, making a royal mess. Mmm, not the lawyers, though... they were just overcharging.~
@37 = ~Why would the warden release the prisoners?~
@38 = ~I really can't say. Some of the other fellows were talking like there was some powerful prisoner who was controlling the warden and making him do these things... sounds too strange to me. More likely he was brain-sick with the plague. The entire Peninsula district is in an uproar, however. I don't think the local constabulary has it under control, either.~ /*I really can't say. Some of the other fellows were talking like there was some powerful prisoner who was controlling the warden and making him do these things... sounds too strange to me.*/
@39 = ~So not only a mission, but a legitimate heroic deed performed for the benefit of a cute elf. I hear ya, m'<LADYLORD>. I'd be glad to help out... for the right price. So let's negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.~ /*So let's negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.*/
@40 = ~Ahhh, which makes you some kind of secret agent for the lovely elven lass? Must be exciting! I'd be glad to help out... for the right price. So let's negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.~ /*So let's negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.*/
@41 = ~Come to think of it, I saw more than a few people getting attacked in the street in broad daylight. If you head to that part of town, you might want to take someone along who knows the roads, aye?~
@42 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some hired help to assist me on my mission.~
@43 = ~No thanks. Goodbye.~
@44 = ~Aww, now that is a shame. Well, m'<LADYLORD>, don't let zombies eat your brains or anything. I hear it's bad for one's health.~
@45 = ~I rather doubt you'll find anyone else of my skill available, m'<LADYLORD>. 800 gold pieces seems like a fair bargain, don't you agree?~
@46 = ~Here's your 800 gold. Welcome aboard, Tomi.~
@47 = ~That seems a little expensive. I'll give you 600.~
@48 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@49 = ~Goodbye.~
@50 = ~Good, good! I smell adventure at hand! Or I need to wash my socks, one of the two... I'll tag along with you, m'<LADYLORD>, as best as I know how... unless you tell me otherwise. If you want me to do something different, just give me a shout, aye?~
@51 = ~I guess it's either that or I spend the next week or two picking lint out of my bellybutton... All right, you've convinced me. 200 gold pieces it is. I'll tag along with you, m'<LADYLORD>, as best as I know how... unless you tell me otherwise. If you want me to do something different, just give me a shout, aye?~ /*I guess it's either that or I spend the next week or two picking lint out of my bellybutton... All right, you've convinced me. 200 gold pieces it is.*/
@52 = ~Do I look like I just got off the last boat from the Moonshaes? I know how dangerous you adventurous types are. 200 or no love from Tomi!~
@53 = ~You were expecting me to work for free? What do I look like? An elf?! Pfffft! Come back when you find a few coins.~
@54 = ~Well, fine. Tomi Undergallows has better things to do. I'm sure someone will hire me any day now.~
@55 = ~So you've come back, m'<LADYLORD>! Looking for a short lad to tickle your feet? Or did ya change your mind about needing a rogue at your side?~ [NWTOM052]
@56 = ~Are you still here?~
@57 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@58 = ~Well, the I haven't been kicked out, yet, so I figures I'm welcome. Why? Do you have any other offers?~
@59 = ~Questions, eh? To be honest, I'm not that big on Neverwinter just yet. I was trying to make some contacts earlier, but they just kept *dying*. How annoying is that? I know a little bit about the Peninsula district, however. It's all a bit fleeting, seeing as I was running through it at the time, but what do you expect from someone who escaped from the prison there?~ /*Questions, eh? To be honest, I'm not that big on Neverwinter just yet. I was trying to make some contacts earlier, but they just kept *dying*. How annoying is that?*/
@60 = ~Well, now, if it isn't <CHARNAME>! Glad I am to see you! Isn't the country wonderful this time of year? So much better than the city with all that... umm... burning and dying. You know.~ [NWTOM053]
@61 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Tomi.~
@62 = ~You again? Are you following me around?~
@63 = ~Okay. What questions do you have? After you and I went our separate ways, Miss Aribeth there approached me and gave me plenty of money to hop along on this pony ride of hers. We're all supposed to help with the search. Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@64 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@65 = ~How much would it cost to hire your services?~
@66 = ~Well... maybe just a little. After all, it's not like there's enough employers alive right now that I have them beating down my door, aye? And anyway... I didn't have to chase you, much. Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@67 = ~Uh-huh. Toodle-loo!~
@68 = ~I've already been paid by Miss Aribeth... and good coin, too, I might add. You'd think this Nasher fellow belched gold at will. I was just told that I'm supposed to help out wherever I can. How sweet and unspecific is that? I, uh, don't suppose you actually want something, do you?~ /*I was just told that I'm supposed to help out wherever I can. How sweet and unspecific is that? I, uh, don't suppose you actually want something, do you?*/
@69 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@70 = ~I could use a good rogue by my side.~
@71 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@72 = ~Okey-dokey! If you find yourself in need of a rougue, I'm already bought and paid for... just need to know where the party is.~
@73 = ~Nothing more than anyone, no. You ask me, though, Luskan's the place to look.~
@74 = ~Luskan?~
@75 = ~Well, isn't it a coincidence that I happen to be a good rogue? Fine... this one-rabbit town was beginning to bore me, anyway.~
@76 = ~Besides a bath? Suit yourself, m'<LADYLORD>.~
@77 = ~Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself. What better place for a frog to hide than amongst toads? Not that I've any evidence to back that up, or anything.~ /*Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself.*/
@78 = ~Heya, m'<LADYLORD>! Decided to wander back to Tomi Undergallows once again, did ya? This job of Miss Aribeth's... looking for them cult fellows... it's been pretty sweet so far. Haven't had to do much 'cept stare at people all suspicious-like.~ [NWTOM055] /*This job of Miss Aribeth's... looking for them cult fellows... it's been pretty sweet so far. Haven't had to do much 'cept stare at people all suspicious-like.*/
@79 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@80 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@81 = ~Do you intend to just sit around here, then?~
@82 = ~Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know? Anyhow, Miss Aribeth heaped a bunch of coin on me to come join this search. Pretty sweet job, so far.~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@83 = ~Well, I wouldn't get a lot done running off on my own, m'<LADYLORD>. Heck, I was just told to come here and wait until somebody needed me. I'm no hero like you are, m'<LADYLORD>... though I am a darn good rogue, if I do say so myself. This town is kind of boring. So far I've counted fourteen chickens that crossed the road. I suppose, if you needed me, I'd be happy to tag along with ya.~ /*This town is kind of boring. So far I've counted fourteen chickens that crossed the road. I suppose, if you needed me, I'd be happy to tag along with ya.*/
@84 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra body. You're in.~
@85 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@86 = ~All righty, then, m'<LADYLORD>... I'm all yours. If ya need me to do something other than what I'm doing, just give me a shout.~
@87 = ~Hullo there! <CHARNAME>, isn't it? Wow... the savior of Neverwinter! Would you sign my napkin? It's a bit greasy... and mind the chicken...~ [NWTOM054]
@88 = ~Well, I wasn't acting alone.~
@89 = ~Yes, that would be me.~
@90 = ~Modesty, eh? How's that working out for ya? If I were you, I'd take advantage of the notoriety while you have it. Three months from now they'll turn you away from the door at McBarnaby's, saying "<CHARNAME> who?"~
@91 = ~Me, I'm Tomi Undergallows. Grin to my friends... Tomi Grin to my other friends. I've been hired by Miss Aribeth, there, to help find these nasty cultist-types.~
