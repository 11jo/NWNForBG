@0 = ~Greetings. Got a particular need this fine day?~
@1 = ~I've got a pass for the Gauntlet.~
@2 = ~Anything interesting in this tavern?~
@3 = ~Let's see what you have for sale.~
@4 = ~Goodbye, and good luck.~
@5 = ~Shh. Don't say it so loud. Here's a key. Go on down when you want. It's the door in the center of the south wall. There are stairs leading down to the basement.~
@6 = ~What is the Gauntlet, specifically?~
@7 = ~Goodbye.~
@8 = ~You've already got a key. Go on down to the Gauntlet, if you want. It's the door in the center of the south wall. There are stairs down to the basement.~
@9 = ~Nothing that needs to be said out in the open. Nope, nothing at all.~
@10 = ~Come on, what harm is there in telling me?~
@11 = ~I don't want to resort to force, but I will if you don't tell me.~
@12 = ~Another time, friend.~
@13 = ~It's a contest open to people who believe there is nothing more basic than defending yourself against someone meaning to do you harm. You win, you get a rank and a few cheers. You lose, you get dusted off and try again. It's about knowing your worth in a fight.~ 
@14 = ~Why is this a big secret?~
@15 = ~Look, if you really want in on what happens here, you'll have to get a pass from a mercenary in the Trade of Blades. Then we'll talk.~
@16 = ~The Trade of Blades? What's that?~
@17 = ~No, I don't think so. It's nothing that concerns you.~
@18 = ~Hmm, maybe you'd fit right in, but it doesn't matter. Not unless you get a pass from a mercenary in the Trade of Blades. Then we'll talk.~
@19 = ~Look, it ain't exactly safe for people to get in a pit and slug it out. We've had accidents... a couple people lost limbs... You win, you get a rank and a few cheers. You lose, you get dusted off and try again. It's about knowing your worth in a fight.The city guards think it's a bloodsport, but it's not. It's about honor in battle, but they don't understand. The guards just see what they want to.Look, if you want to try, that's up to you. just don't blab about it, and don't complain if you lose. People don't like that.~
@20 = ~If you don't know, I doubt you'll be back. It's the mercenary guild in the northwest of the City Core. That's all I'm saying.~
@21 = ~Well met, Boss. What can I do for you?~

@43 = ~Well, the last owner, Claudus, he set things up so he didn't have to do a thing. He was always busy with this or that. Anyway, all you need to do is come in every week or so and I'll give you the profits that we've made. You won't get rich, but it's better than nothing. Besides, I can tell you'd rather be out adventuring and such. You look like the type. It sounds dangerous to me, but I bet there's good coin in it.~ 
@44 = ~Farewell.~
