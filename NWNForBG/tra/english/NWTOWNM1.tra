@0 = ~Please! You... you don't look like them soldiers... you won't hurt me, will you?~
@1 = ~I am an adventurer looking for information; I don't mean any harm.~
@2 = ~Get out of my way! I'll take whatever I want!~
@3 = ~I was just leaving.~
@4 = ~NP: I... I think you're not a bad person. You just scared me so much! Besides, there's soldiers all over the place. So, what do you want from me? Why are you here?~ /*I... suppose you don't seem the bad sort. You just startled me so! With all the soldiers rampaging around, I assumed...*/
@5 = ~Why are you so frightened? I said I wouldn't hurt you.~
@6 = ~What's going on in this city?~
@7 = ~Goodbye.~
@8 = ~I don't believe you! You're just like the other soldiers, you are!! Here to rob me or kill me!!~
@9 = ~Aahhh! Robber!! Get away, get away!!~
@10 = ~Thank Ilmater! Just go, go!!~
@11 = ~I... I know. It's just that the soldiers have been rampaging through the streets for weeks now... They take whatever they like. If they think you can fight, they force you to join one of the High Captains' armies... or they kill you. And... and gods forbid they think you're working for one of the other High Captains...~ /*They take whatever they like. If they think you can fight, they force you to join one of the High Captains' armies... or they kill you.*/
@12 = ~Tell me about these High Captains.~
@13 = ~Is there nobody to stop all this?~
@14 = ~N-nobody knows, for sure. Some weeks ago, the High Captains just started... started trying to kill each other. Each one of them has their own army, and they've been fighting in the streets night and day. Buildings burned, people slaughtered... everything's falling apart! Worse, now that so many are dead... there's monsters come to the streets. Big rats and walking dead. Some says the High Captains use them for their armies, too.~ /*Worse, now that so many are dead... there's monsters come to the streets. Big rats and walking dead. Some says the High Captains use them for their armies, too.*/
@15 = ~Be careful on those streets. They'll kill you if you're spotted.~
@16 = ~I don't... know much about them. There was five of them, and they was all pirate lords, or used t' be. They've gone mad, everyone says. Maybe each of them wants to control the city? I don't know... but they're killing everyone and they don't care what happens to any of us.~ /*Maybe each of them wants to control the city? I don't know... but they're killing everyone and they don't care what happens to any of us.*/
@17 = ~N-no... who? Maybe the wizards? I don't know.~
@18 = ~What wizards?~
@19 = ~The wizards of that Arcane Brotherhood. They lives in a big tower on the island at the mouth of the river. I don't know any more abouts them, I swear! They... they're just supposed to be real powerful, that's all.~ /*I don't know any more abouts them, I swear! They... they're just supposed to be real powerful, that's all.*/
@20 = ~Tell me about the High Captains.~
@21 = ~Back again? Did you... need something?~
@22 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@23 = ~Questions? What do you want to know?~
@24 = ~Don't hurt me! Please don't hurt me!!~
