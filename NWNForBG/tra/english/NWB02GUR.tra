@0 = ~If you're planning on going through the gates you better make sure you're well armed. The fighting is thick and bloody in the war zone.~
@1 = ~How bad is it in there?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~It's pretty much a no man's land beyond the gates. The catapults have smashed the city to bits and the streets are swarming with Luskan soldiers. Worse things, too, like them damn war golems.~
@4 = ~What do you know about the catapults?~
@5 = ~What can you tell me about the war golems?~
@6 = ~Any reports of where Aribeth or Maugrim might be?~
@7 = ~Perhaps we'll meet again if the Luskan army doesn't kill us all first.~
@8 = ~The only hope we have of surviving this invasion is to hold the City Core until reinforcements from the Lords' Alliance arrive. But with boulders and burning pitch raining down on us day and night, it ain't going to happen.~
@9 = ~NP: The bombardment has stopped! Someone must have managed to destroy the catapults, but it's not enough to save the na. We have too many losses. We'll try to hold the Heart of the City for as long as possible, but help from Waterdeep is too far away. Even Castle Nevers will fall before they get here.~ /*The bombardment has stopped! Someone must have taken the catapults out but that won't be enough to save us. We've already suffered too many losses as it is.*/
@10 = ~There's no way to fight those bloody things! They hacked us up like lumberjacks chopping wood, and nothing we tried could even slow them down.~
@11 = ~Is there anything more you can tell me about them?~
@12 = ~NP: To tell you the truth, lately it has been said that the golems have suddenly stopped. Something must have happened to them. But we have already suffered a huge loss. Too many have fallen defending Neverwinter. I don't think we can hold the Heart of the City until the forces of the Lords' Alliance arrive.~ /*But the damage is already done. Too many Neverwinter defenders fell against them. I don't think we can hold the City Core until the reinforcements from the Lords' Alliance get here.*/
@13 = ~During the initial assault on Neverwinter that traitor Aribeth led the Luskan troops while Maugrim stayed at the back and unleashed his magic on us. Haven't heard of any sightings lately, though.~
@14 = ~Unless somebody takes out those catapults, and I mean all of them, we'll be pounded into submission! Luskan will capture the City Core and even Castle Never will fall. Maybe you'll have better luck than Captain Trancar did.~
@15 = ~Captain Trancar?~
@16 = ~They're probably holed up somewhere plotting how to get inside the City Core and bring down Castle Never before reinforcements arrive to help us. The Gods know where they might be: an abandoned home, an old shop... they could be anywhere!~
@17 = ~Anything else you can tell me about them?~
@18 = ~People have been saying stuff, as you might expect. But I doubt any of it's true. And I don't want to spread false stories and add to the fear and panic.~
@19 = ~NP: I don't spread rumors, and your information could help end this war.~ /*I'm no gossip monger, and your information might help end this war.*/
@20 = ~NP: I doubt that you alone can stop this war. But I don't think it will do much harm if I tell you what they say. Some say that Maugrim and this cult of his are going to perform some kind of ritual. And their goal is to destroy Neverwinter once and for all.~ /*There's whispers that Maugrim and that cult of his are planning some kind of ritual. Something to destroy Neverwinter once and for all.*/
@21 = ~There's whispers that Maugrim and that cult of his are planning some kind of ritual. Something to destroy Neverwinter once and for all.~
@22 = ~Don't know that they need to bother, though. I doubt we'll be able to hold the City Core long enough for the Lords' Alliance reinforcements to get here as it is.~
