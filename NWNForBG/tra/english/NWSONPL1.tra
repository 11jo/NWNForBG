@0 = ~Yeah? What do you want? My folks ain't want me talking to no adventurers. You're an adventurer, right?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Yes, I am an adventurer.~
@3 = ~Who? Me? I'm no adventurer.~
@4 = ~Goodbye.~
@5 = ~Um... I guess I can answer a question for you. What did you want to know? Hey, is this about Urth? I don't want to get him into trouble.~
@6 = ~I just need some directions.~
@7 = ~I need information about Port Llast.~
@8 = ~Urth? Who's that?~
@9 = ~Do you know anything about the neighborhood?~
@10 = ~Ah - what kind of stuff were you wanting to ask me about?~
@11 = ~We get lots of adventurers in Port Llast now-a-days. Pop says they all come from Neverwinter, 'cause they want to live here instead. I want to be an adventurer, but pop says that it's a waste of time - um, no offense, <SIRMAAM>.~ /*We get lots of adventurers in Port Llast now-a-days. Pop says they all come from Neverwinter, 'cause they want to live here instead.*/
@12 = ~Does your pop not like adventurers?~
@13 = ~I don't know. He says not to talk to them. I guess it's because we're farmers. He doesn't like fighting.~
@14 = ~Urth is my friend. He lives with his family in a house on the west side of the town. It's the Eisenfeldt house. But... I don't know. He's been weird lately. I shouldn't say anything else.~
@15 = ~Who are the Eisenfeldts? Where do they live?~
@16 = ~Actually, I'd rather ask you about something else.~
@17 = ~I don't know. I don't see him much anymore. I saw him the other day and he ran away from me. He's kind of scary now. Can we talk about something else? Did you have another question?~ /*I don't know. I don't see him much anymore. I saw him the other day and he ran away from me. He's kind of scary now.*/
@18 = ~Pop says I shouldn't talk about people behind their back. I shouldn't say anything more. Can we talk about something else? Do you have any other questions?~
@19 = ~Bye, bye stranger. You're a pretty nice <SIRMAAM>, after all.~
@20 = ~Sure. What are you looking for? I've been living here my whole entire life. I know where everything is.~
@21 = ~Is there an inn nearby?~
@22 = ~Is there a temple in town?~
@23 = ~I need to buy some equipment.~
@24 = ~Are there any rangers or druids within town?~
@25 = ~Yeah. You'll probably want to go to the Alliance Arms, it's south of town, near the docks. There's lots of people like you there. Anything else?~
@26 = ~Yeah - Neurik runs the temple and looks after all of us - at least as much as he can. The temple's off the town square.~
@27 = ~You can buy swords and everything at the Cracked Anvil it's in the central part of the town. My pop says it's all a waste of money, though. No offense, <SIRMAAM>.~
@28 = ~Yeah, there's one in the northeast part of town. You could probably talk to him if you wanted to. There's a door in the town wall that leads to the grove, but it's a secret.~
@29 = ~Ummm... I don't really know what - most people just go to Neurik when they got a question about local stuff. He's at the Tyrran temple.~
@30 = ~Umm... you mean like off of the farm? My pop doesn't let me go too far. He says there's criminals or something outside of town. Of course, whiny Shaldrissa swoons over all of them. You could probably ask the guys at the barracks. They all come and go and know stuff like that. It's the place just south of the Tyrran temple.~ /*Umm... you mean like off of the farm? My pop doesn't let me go too far. He says there's criminals or something outside of town. Of course, whiny Shaldrissa swoons over all of them.*/
@31 = ~"Whiny" Shaldrissa? Who's that?~
@32 = ~Is there anyone else that could help me? A local, maybe?~
@33 = ~Oh, she's just some girl. She's the mayor's daughter, and she's always talking about wanting to leave town. I guess I think it would be fun to go adventuring, too, but she's just someone who won't stop talking about it. My dad says she's got her head in the wrong place.~ /*I guess I think it would be fun to go adventuring, too, but she's just someone who won't stop talking about it. My dad says she's got her head in the wrong place.*/
@34 = ~Aw, I shouldn't have said "whiny" - I didn't mean nothing by it. Pop says not to talk about others behind their backs. Sorry.~
@35 = ~Ummm... you could probably talk to Neurik. He's at the temple, but he pretty much knows all sorts of stuff. Maybe he can help.~
@36 = ~Yeah, you're back? You probably want to ask me something, I know a lot of things.~
@37 = ~I just wanted to see you. Goodbye.~
@38 = ~Really? Was he - was he all right?~
@39 = ~You couldn't catch him? You were always the faster one.~
