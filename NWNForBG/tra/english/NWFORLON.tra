@0 = ~Who are you? I hope you are a guard. We need more around here. There's trouble in the prison, and nobody's doing much about it.~
@1 = ~Shouldn't the prison officials handle it?~
@2 = ~I'm sure the prisoners are safely locked away.~
@3 = ~The prison, eh? How do I get there?~
@4 = ~Don't worry, ma'am. I'll look into it.~
@5 = ~Why should I care about this?~
@6 = ~You would think that. Commander Alaefin is the Head Gaoler there. He's always been so kind to us... He was a good man once.~
@7 = ~What do you mean, "once?"~ 
@8 = ~If only they were! They prowl the streets with the gall to say... oh nothing! I don't know who to trust these days...~
@9 = ~Please, tell me. I'm here to help.~
@10 = ~Just wind your way up to the top o' the Peninsula. The guards walk that path twice a day, though I suppose it's a fair bit more dangerous now.~
@11 = ~It's good there are still decent folk about in these times. Best of luck to you, then.~
@12 = ~It ain't my business if you do or don't. I'd think, though, that if you've the power to help, you've a duty to do it.~
@13 = ~Oh nothing. I don't know who to trust these days...~
@14 = ~Oh very well. The prisoners who escaped are saying that it was the Head Gaoler himself who set them loose...~
@15 = ~I have to keep my mouth shut, <SIRMAAM>. My life might be on the line. Please, just leave me alone.~
@16 = ~What are you doing in my home? Oh, as if there isn't enough trouble around here.~
@17 = ~I guess things are getting back to normal... I hope. I hope the plague doesn't get me.~
