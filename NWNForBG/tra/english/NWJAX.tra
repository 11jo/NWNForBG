@0 = ~Help! Attack! What? Who? Er... oh... um... you don't look like... nevermind. Hello <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~ [NWJAX050]
@1 = ~You seem rather nervous. What's your name?~
@2 = ~I don't look like who?~
@3 = ~My name is Jax. Professor Jax, a famous archeologist don't you know. I am looking for knowledge about some ancient creatures. That's why I came here. Who are you?~
@4 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. What creatures are you talking about?~
@5 = ~NP: I am an adventurer from the group<CHARNAME> . What creatures are you talking about?~ /*I am <CHARNAME>. What creatures are you talking about?*/
@6 = ~Nevermind my name, what are these creatures you are looking for?~
@7 = ~Er... trolls of course. Like the ones that attacked my expedition.~
@8 = ~Maybe we should start with introductions.~
@9 = ~Trolls? Tell me more!~
@10 = ~I am talking about a creator race. Very fascinating actually. I believe they lived thousands of years ago and I think one of their ruins lies somewhere around here.~
@11 = ~So you are looking for dead things?~
@12 = ~Oh... oh my, that hardly seems to be a polite way to start a conversation. Are you sure you're not a troll? I suppose not.~
@13 = ~Trolls attacked a group of us in a cave to the north. We were there searching for an entrance to... ah but maybe I should start with an introduction.~
@14 = ~NP: No, no, no, Im looking for evidence of the existence of this race. You see, I went hunting with some fellow archaeologists in these cave systems to find an entrance to some of the ruins that lie beneath. It was a delightful expedition - at least at first. I believed that I would find many treasures and books created by this race there. But then we were attacked by trolls and ogres.~ /*You see, some fellow archeologists and I were hunting through the cave systems in the area to find an entrance to some ruins that lie beneath them. It was a marvelous expedition, or so it seemed.*/
@15 = ~Trolls? Ogres? Tell me more about them.~
@16 = ~NP: I think thats enough talk. Goodbye.~ /*I think I've heard enough. Goodbye.*/
@17 = ~NP: You know what Im looking for! We already talked about this. Okay, Ill cover the important points again. If I had a book in my hands that proves that these ruins are the remains of a creator race, I could get the rest of the money from my grant. I need to find the Full History of the Ruins.~ /*If I could get my hands on a book that proves these ruins were built by the creator race, then I could get the rest of my grant money. I need to find a Complete History of the Ruins.*/
@18 = ~Grant money? Is that what you are worried about?~
@19 = ~What is the grant money for?~
@20 = ~I was studying a rock formation in one of the caves when they attacked us. We had some guards with us and they were holding the ogres off, but the trolls killed them as easily as children.~
@21 = ~What did you do then?~
@22 = ~NP: You hired bad security!~ /*Obviously you didn't hire good guards!*/
@23 = ~Oh. That's too bad. If you change your mind, just speak to me again.~
@24 = ~We ran for our lives. The guards gave us enough time for a few of us to get away. But not enough. Not nearly enough.~
@25 = ~I'm sorry for your grief.~
@26 = ~Get to the point.~
@27 = ~We hired what we could afford. And we paid for our mistake.~
@28 = ~All that death has come to nothing! So many sacrifices and we still don't have the proof I need about the creator race.~
@29 = ~Tell me more about this creator race.~
@30 = ~Not too much is known about them. They were very powerful and it is speculated that they fought for control of Toril against the dragons.~
@31 = ~When did they fight dragons?~
@32 = ~NP: How long ago was it supposed to be?~ /*How long ago did this supposedly take place?*/
@33 = ~NP: This happened over 10,000 years ago. Even before the first human civilization of Netheril had ascended. They used powerful spells, creating magical items and artifacts, which now, when the gods have limited the effects of magic, one can only dream of.~ /*They used powerful spells, creating magical effects and items that can only be dreamed of now that the gods have limited its use.*/
@34 = ~NP: Are there any treasures there?~ /*Gots new news at all?*/
@35 = ~You sound like the supposed 'scholars' in Waterdeep. Always sneering in disbelief.~
@36 = ~Er... well, if they were powerful enough to contend with dragons, as I think they were, then they must have had some powerful magic items. Not to mention wealth. The trolls might have some treasure too.~
@37 = ~And you think you can prove this race existed?~
@38 = ~What you need for to prove?~
@39 = ~NP: If my assumptions about their high development are correct, they must have left behind some texts. If I had a book in my hands that proves that these ruins are the remains of a creator race, I could get the rest of the money from my grant. I need to find the Full History of the Ruins.~ /*If I could get my hands on a book that proves these ruins were built by the creator race, then I could get the rest of my grant money. I need to find a Complete History of the Ruins.*/
@40 = ~NP: No no no! Money is needed so that I can continue my research. The money will go towards security, supplies, and equipment, not to mention paying for the consultations of other scientists. Without that money, I wont know anything else. That is why it is so important for me to find this evidence.~ /*The money goes to pay for guards, supplies and equipment, as well as the expertise of other researchers. Without that money, I cannot learn more.*/
@41 = ~I could help you look for this ancient tome.~
@42 = ~I'm not really interested.~
@43 = ~NP: The money will go towards security, supplies, and equipment, not to mention paying for the consultations of other scientists. Without that money, I wont know anything else. That is why it is so important for me to find this evidence.~ /*The money goes to pay for guards, supplies and equipment, as well as the expertise of other researchers. Without that money, I cannot learn more.*/
@44 = ~NP: ABOUT<SIRMAAM> ., that would be great. And since I need it for my own financial gain, I will pay you 1500 gold, and you can keep all the treasures you find. Here is the key to our back rooms. There you will find my colleagues who can share more information with you. Please find me a book that proves that the creator race existed and left behind these ruins. And bring it to me as soon as you can.~ /*Oh my <PRO_LADYLORD>, that would be wonderful. And since I need this for my own financial gain, I would pay you 500 gold pieces and you can keep any treasure you find. Here is a key for the barracks. You can talk to my colleagues inside for more information.*/
@45 = ~This sounds very dangerous. I think some money up front would be justified.~
@46 = ~All right, I'm off.~
@47 = ~Oh my. I was really hoping you could help. If you change your mind come talk to me again.~
@48 = ~NP: This sounds reasonable. Here are 300 coins. This should seal the deal. Be careful,<SIRMAAM> . It will be a very difficult operation. Good luck to you.~ /*Be careful <PRO_GIRLBOY>. This has turned out to be a very difficult operation. Good luck.*/

@50 = ~NP: I just cant afford it. I will pay you only when you bring the artifact. Be careful,<SIRMAAM> . It will be a very difficult operation. Good luck to you.~ /*I just can't afford to do that. I can only pay you when you bring the artfiact back.*/
@51 = ~NP: Be careful,<SIRMAAM> . It will be a very difficult operation. Good luck to you.~ /*Be careful <PRO_GIRLBOY>. This has turned out to be a very difficult operation. Good luck.*/
@52 = ~Oh, hello there again. Er... something you needed? I am quite busy with my research, you know.~ [NWJAX051]
@53 = ~What's your name again?~
@54 = ~What kind of research do you do here?~
@55 = ~Oh. I wouldn't expect someone of your limited... uh... that is, it's always pleasant to see someone interested in my research! Let me tell you about it.~
@56 = ~You are back already? What can I help you with now?~ [NWJAX052]
@57 = ~What were you looking for again?~
@58 = ~I want to help you find that book. How much will you pay me?~
@59 = ~This wouldn't happen to be the book you are looking for, would it?~
@60 = ~Goodbye.~
@61 = ~NP: My gods, but I thought it was my sclerosis! As I said, I am looking for one ancient tome that I need. So far without much success. If I had a book in my hands that proves that these ruins are the remains of a creator race, I could get the rest of the money from my grant. I need to find the Full History of the Ruins.~ /*If I could get my hands on a book that proves these ruins were built by the creator race, then I could get the rest of my grant money. I need to find a Complete History of the Ruins.*/
@62 = ~NP: Uh... mm... oh yes! Amazing! How did you manage to deal with the trolls? No, it doesnt matter. It is important that you have the book now. Well, great job<SIRMAAM> . So... I guess 1500 gold is a generous reward for finding this book?~ /*Er... um... oh, yes! Astounding! How did you get past the trolls? No, it is of no import. What matters is you have it now.*/
@63 = ~NP: 1500 gold? You wont believe the hell I went through to get this.~ /*1000 gold? Are you out of your mind? I'm not giving you that much!*/
@64 = ~NP: Youd better shell out a lot, or Ill put you through what I went through.~ /*You better fork over more than that or you'll get to experience all the pain I suffered recovering the darn thing.*/
@65 = ~Certainly, that sounds fine by me.~
@66 = ~NP: Never. I will keep the book.~ /*Then I am keeping him.*/
@67 = ~Er... yes, well, goodbye again.~
@68 = ~Oh my. Well, I guess it was probably very tough. I hope that 750 gold will cover it. That's all I have left.~
@69 = ~I don't think so. I can get a better price from someone else, I think.~
@70 = ~NP: 1500 gold is all I can afford right now. You wont keep this useless book for yourself, will you?~ /*500 gold pieces is all I can afford right now. You wouldn't break an agreement, would you?*/
@71 = ~NP: I agree, give me money.~ /*Me not pay you moneys.*/
@72 = ~Oh my, you must have had a rough time. No need to get jumpy. Here is 750 gp. It's all that I have left.~
@73 = ~All right. 750 gold pieces it is.~
@74 = ~Wonderful. I can hardly wait to get back to Waterdeep. Those snobs are going to choke when they see this! Good luck <PRO_GIRLBOY>.~
@75 = ~I am off for Waterdeep. Excuse me.~ [NWJAX055]

@77 = ~No! It is of no value to you, but I simply must have it. Please!~
@78 = ~NP: Er... well. I must return to Waterdeep immediately. Have a good journey. Im leaving for Waterdeep. Excuse me.~ [NWJAX055] /*Er... good. I must return to Waterdeep now. Good luck to you.*/
@79 = ~NP: Wait! Please,<SIRMAAM> ! 2000 coins, I cant take it anymore!~ /*Wait! Please, my <PRO_LADYLORD>! 1000 gp, no more!*/
@80 = ~All right. 750 gold pieces it is.~
@81 = ~Nope, I'm keeping it.~
@82 = ~Part of me wishes the trolls got you. Oh my, I can't believe I said that. I've got to get back to civilization.~
@83 = ~NP: Oh... uh... why did you even come back here if youre going to keep her? No one will pay more for it than I do, because no one needs it so desperately. What mistake! Great, goodbye.~ /*No one will pay you more than I would have, because no one wants it as badly. What a mistake! Fine, goodbye.*/

@85 = ~Er... oh, you're already back. What can I do to help you? Any evidence of the tome yet?~ [NWJAX053]
@86 = ~Where did you say you thought that book was?~
@87 = ~I think I found your book, is this it?~
@88 = ~No, nothing yet.~
@89 = ~Quit being so pushy! I'll get around to finding it.~
@90 = ~NP: I believe the ruins are under the local cave system. The book must be in there somewhere.~ /*I think there are ruins underneath the cave systems in this area. The book should be in there somewhere.*/
@91 = ~Okay, goodbye.~
@92 = ~Er... um... well I guess there's not much else to say. Keep hunting.~
@93 = ~I paid an advance already, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. I expect a get-to-it attitude for that kind of money. Is there anything else?~
@94 = ~Oh, I don't think you understand how important this is. This could really help our understanding of the historical roots of society.~
@95 = ~NP: Good luck in your search<SIRMAAM> .~ /*Good luck in the search young <PRO_GIRLBOY>.*/
