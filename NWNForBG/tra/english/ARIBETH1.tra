@0 = ~NP: Welcome,<CHARNAME> . I am Lady Aribeth de Tilmarand, paladin in the service of Tyr and right hand of Nasher Alagondar, ruler of Neverwinter. I expected you.~ [ARIBE051] /*I am Lady Aribeth de Tylmarande, paladin in the service of Tyr and the right hand of Nasher Alagondar, Lord of Neverwinter. I have been waiting for you.*/
@1 = ~I came as quickly as I could, Lady Aribeth.~
@2 = ~You were waiting for me? Why?~
@3 = ~I'm here now. Say what you have to say.~
@4 = ~NP: Neverwinter needs you to survive the Howling Death. The attack on the Academy had robbed the city of its last, feeble hope. I need you to get back what we lost<CHARNAME> .~ [ARIBE054] /*The attack on the Academy doused the one faint spark of hope this city had. I need you to help recover that which we have lost, <CHARNAME>.*/
@5 = ~It will be an honor to serve you, Lady Aribeth!~
@6 = ~I serve no master but myself!~
@7 = ~I'll help you... for a price.~
@8 = ~I have recovered one of the reagents for the cure.~
@9 = ~I knew I could count on you, <CHARNAME>. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this, it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.~ [ARIBE055]
@10 = ~You will answer only to me, <CHARNAME>, and I will give you free reign in your tasks.~ [ARIBE120]
@11 = ~I promise your reward for this task will be well worth your efforts. There are many rumors about the plague, but if you are to aid me in this, it is important you know the truth about the Wailing Death.~ [ARIBE121]
@12 = ~Well done, <CHARNAME>! I knew you wouldn't let me down!~ [ARIBE125]
@13 = ~Explain about the Yuan-Ti in the Beggar's Nest.~
@14 = ~Explain about the Intellect Devourer in the prison.~
@15 = ~Explain about the Dryad in the Blacklake district.~
@16 = ~Explain about the Cockatrice in the Docks district.~
@17 = ~Our divine healers can do nothing to help those afflicted by the Wailing Death, and even our most powerful magic cannot raise those who succumb to the illness.~ [ARIBE057]
@18 = ~NP: I heard about the problems at the Beggars' Nest. And behind everything was this vile creature? As if one plague is not enough. You have succeeded brilliantly where everyone else has failed! Neverwinter is in your debt. The fight against the plague drained Neverwinter's treasury. I'm sorry, but for all your merits, I can't offer you more than 2000 gold.~ [ARIBE126] /*Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.*/
@19 = ~NP: Is that why we lost contact with the prison inmates? As if one plague is not enough. You have succeeded brilliantly where everyone else has failed! Neverwinter is in your debt. The fight against the plague drained Neverwinter's treasury. I'm sorry, but for all your merits, I can't offer you more than 2000 gold.~ [ARIBE127] /*Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.*/
@20 = ~NP: It's a shame to see how badly such a gentle creature is treated. The plague does enough harm without us. You have succeeded brilliantly where everyone else has failed! Neverwinter is in your debt. The fight against the plague drained Neverwinter's treasury. I'm sorry, but for all your merits, I can't offer you more than 2,000 gold.~ [ARIBE128] /*Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.*/
@21 = ~NP: This old bastard? I think such people will not make any concessions even in these dark times. You have succeeded brilliantly where everyone else has failed! Neverwinter is in your debt. The fight against the plague drained Neverwinter's treasury. I'm sorry, but for all your merits, I can't offer you more than 2,000 gold.~ [ARIBE129] /*Battling the plague has drained the coffers of Neverwinter. I regret I cannot offer you more than 500 gold pieces for all you have accomplished.*/
@22 = ~But a short time ago we had word that Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, the famous archmage of Waterdeep, had discovered a potential cure, one that might be concocted from the essence of four rare and magical creatures.~ [ARIBE058]
@23 = ~I have heard such rumors before.~
@24 = ~What became of these creatures?~
@25 = ~Time's wasting. Get to the point, Aribeth.~
@26 = ~NP: You have earned a place of honor among those who tried to help Neverwinter during these difficult times. Together with us you will participate in the ritual of making medicine. Are you ready to go to the ritual chamber? We need to go as soon as possible.~ [ARIBE135] /*You have earned a place of honor among those who sought to aid Neverwinter in these dark times. You will stand with us as the ritual to create the cure is performed.*/
@27 = ~Yes - let's go at once!~
@28 = ~No - I need to take care of a couple things.~
@29 = ~Under great secrecy the four creatures were gathered in Waterdeep then sent here to Neverwinter, as strange a menagerie as any has ever set eyes on: a cockatrice, an intellect devourer, a yuan-ti and a dryad.~ [ARIBE059]
@30 = ~Then we shall waste no more time - Neverwinter has suffered long enough!~ [ARIBE137]

@32 = ~NP: You have every right to be with those who tried to help Neverwinter during this difficult time. I'll give you a few minutes to prepare. But hurry up<CHARNAME> â€œNeverwinter has suffered enough already. Come back and tell me when you're ready.~ [ARIBE138] /*You have earned the right to stand with those who sought to aid Neverwinter in this dark time. I will spare a few minutes for you to get ready.*/
@33 = ~NP: I have ordered them sent to the Academy, the famous Neverwinter institute for all adventurers. Once I myself studied there, so I decided that the coaches and students are devoted to Lord Nasher. And then someone attacked the Academy.~ [ARIBE060] /*I ordered them sent to the Academy, Neverwinter's renowned training institution for adventurers of every ilk. I once studied there myself and I thought the instructors and students were loyal to Lord Nasher.*/
@34 = ~Go ahead.~
@35 = ~So you think someone within the Academy betrayed you.~
@36 = ~NP: The attack took us by surprise. After this massacre at the Academy, only a handful of people remained alive, including you. Fentik and Dester arrived with reinforcements, but in all the confusion, the Waterdeep creatures scattered through the streets of Neverwinter - and with them all our hopes for a cure.~ [ARIBE062] /*Fenthick and Desther arrived with reinforcements, but during the confusion of battle the Waterdhavian creatures disappeared into the streets of Neverwinter - and our hopes of a cure vanished with them.*/
@37 = ~How may I serve you in this, Lady Aribeth?~
@38 = ~Let me guess, you want me to get those creatures back.~
@39 = ~What you want me do now, Aribeth?~
@40 = ~The Academy may have been betrayed from within. Or perhaps I simply put too much faith in the instructors, students and staff to keep this news secret, as Desther claims.~ [ARIBE061]
@41 = ~Your task in this is twofold, <CHARNAME>. First, find the Waterdhavian creatures and bring them back to me at any cost. We need to harvest components from these creatures if we are to concoct a cure for the Wailing Death. This is your most important duty.~ [ARIBE064]
@42 = ~Second, we must discover who was behind the attack on the Academy. Any evidence you uncover in this matter should be brought to Fenthick. He is the one assigned the task of unmasking our hidden enemy.~ [ARIBE066]
@43 = ~I will do as you command, Lady Aribeth.~
@44 = ~I'll do it, but the rewards better be worthwhile!~
@45 = ~Why did you choose me for this?~
@46 = ~Shouldn't the city watch be helping in this?~
@47 = ~How do we even know the creatures are still alive?~
@48 = ~NP: I ask you to be reasonable<CHARNAME> . News of the attack and strange creatures roaming the city will only increase the panic and chaos on our already hectic streets. I can hardly tell you anything else about the assignment. As soon as you need supplies, come back and talk to me, I can sell them to you through the shop here in the Temple of Tyr.~ [ARIBE073] /*I ask for your discretion in this matter, <CHARNAME>. News of the attack and strange creatures roaming the city will only add to the panic and chaos already in the streets.*/
@49 = ~Whatever rewards you seek - fame, fortune, glory - you shall have in abundance. Provided you are successful in this task.~ [ARIBE072]
@50 = ~NP: Your skill and courage are evident, and I know that you are not with those who want to destroy Neverwinter. The City Watch can do little to help in the search; they barely have enough men to maintain order on the streets of Neverwinter. And others, like me and Fentik, have other things to do that require our constant presence here.~ [ARIBE070] /*The city watch can do little to help in this search; their numbers are barely enough to keep order in the streets of Neverwinter. Others, like Fenthick or myself, have duties that require we stay here.*/
@51 = ~NP: The City Watch can do little to help in the search; they barely have enough men to maintain order on the streets of Neverwinter. And others, like me and Fentik, have other things to do that require our constant presence here. You performed well during this attack,<CHARNAME> . Your skill and courage are evident, and I know that you are not with those who want to destroy Neverwinter.~ [ARIBE071] /*The city watch can do little to help in this search; their numbers are barely enough to keep order in the streets of Neverwinter. Others, like Fenthick or myself, have duties that require we stay here.*/
@52 = ~NP: According to our information, all creatures escaped death during the battle at the Academy. Now there are many reports of strange creatures that have appeared in all quarters of the city. Your duty is to bring back the creatures from Waterdeep so we can deal with the Howling Death. Now the fate of Neverwinter depends on you.~ [ARIBE068] /*By all accounts the creatures escaped the battle at the Academy unharmed, and there are many reports of strange beasts pouring in from every district of the city.*/
@53 = ~Take this gold so you can buy the necessary supplies for your mission. Remember to stock up on healing potions before you go. They will be critical to your survival.~ [ARIBE160]
@54 = ~I will begin my search for the Waterdhavian creatures at once!~
@55 = ~I need to ask you some questions.~
@56 = ~It would be nice to know a little more about the Lady I'm working for.~
@57 = ~Tell me about Fenthick.~
@58 = ~What do you think of Desther?~
@59 = ~Goodbye.~
@60 = ~NP: You may need an assistant in your case. A variety of mercenaries can be hired at the Sword Fair in the Heart of the City. Perhaps you should start looking for missing creatures from the peninsula. Strange animals have already been spotted there several times. Farewell,<CHARNAME> . May Tyr show you the way.~ [ARIBE076] /*You might want to seek someone to accompany you in your mission. There are a number of mercenaries for hire at the Trade of Blades, located in the City Core.*/

@62 = ~I will do my best to answer what questions I may, <CHARNAME>.~ [ARIBE079]
@63 = ~What can you tell me about the attack on the Academy?~
@64 = ~I want to know more about the Wailing Death.~
@65 = ~I want more information on the Waterdhavian creatures and this cure.~
@66 = ~Where can I get some supplies?~
@67 = ~NP: I don't like to brag about my accomplishments. Suffice it to say that I am a paladin of Tyr, and I am honored that Lord Nasher has made me responsible for finding a cure for the Howling Death. Anything else,<CHARNAME> ?~ [ARIBE112] /*I am not one to boast of my accomplishments, <CHARNAME>. Suffice to say that I am a Paladin of Tyr and I am honored Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the Wailing Death.*/
@68 = ~NP: It's no secret that Fentik and I are lovers. Our feelings for each other can only be compared with the reverence for Tyr and devotion to Neverwinter. Although Lord Nasher has made me responsible for finding a cure for the plague, without Fentik I would not have been able to do anything. His faith and devotion serve me as a support in this difficult time. Anything else,<CHARNAME> ?~ [ARIBE113] /*Although Lord Nasher has placed me in charge of finding a cure for the plague, I could not do this without Fenthick's help. His faith and conviction are a comfort to me in times of darkness.*/
@69 = ~NP: I consider Helmits to be arrogant, sanctimonious, smug, lying hypocrites! Forgive me for being rude, but Dester and I don't get along. Dester questions all my decisions, or so it seems. He keeps accusing me of betraying my faith and that I don't trust divine power.~ [ARIBE116] /*Desther challenges my every decision on general principle, or so it would seem. He is constantly accusing me of abandoning my faith and not trusting enough in the power of the divine.*/
@70 = ~Why do you put up with him?~
@71 = ~Maybe he has a point.~
@72 = ~NP: You are well aware that this was a real massacre. Only a handful of teachers and students of the Academy survived. While we haven't figured out who's behind this attack, the enemy knew the Waterdeep creatures were there. How they learned this is also unknown, and it will not be easy to find out. All information about who may be behind this attack, immediately pass on to Fentik. It is he who is responsible for the capture of this unknown enemy.~ [ARIBE080] /*As yet we have not discovered the identity of those behind the attack, but the enemy knew the Waterdhavian creatures were there. How they came by that knowledge is a troubling prospect.*/
@73 = ~I want to ask you about something else.~
@74 = ~NP: The first victims appeared a few months ago, and a few days later the disease spread throughout the city. This is not the first epidemic in Neverwinter, but it is the worst. Unlike other diseases, the Howling Death cannot be healed even by the divine magic of the priests. Maybe that's why she's so terrible.~ [ARIBE092] /*The first victims were reported several months ago, and within days it had spread to all corners of the city. It was not the first plague Neverwinter has suffered, but it is by far the worst.*/
@75 = ~The room next door is full of plague victims. Aren't you scared of being infected?~
@76 = ~Did the quarantine do anything to help?~
@77 = ~NP: Khelben &quot;Blackstaff&quot; Arunsun, archmage of Waterdeep, has found a promising cure. But we didn't even get a chance to try it out. The creatures were taken from us too quickly. According to the Blackstaff, the cure requires Cockatrice Feathers, Brain Eater Brain, Yan-ti blood, and a tuft of hair freshly plucked from a dryad's head.~ [ARIBE099] /*It was Khelben "Blackstaff" Arunsun, the archmage of Waterdeep, who discovered the potential cure. However, we have not even had a chance to test it. The creatures were taken from us too quickly.*/
@78 = ~NP: I have no extra equipment - everything was distributed to the city guards to maintain order. I think I can sell you a few things from the temple armory... Yes, I will prepare everything that can be sold to you. When you return, ask about the services of the temple. If I don't have something, the Heart of the City is full of shops, you can find anything there.~ [ARIBE110] /*Yes, I will arrange to sell you whatever I can. When you next come back, ask me for temple services. If I don't have something, the city core has all manner of shops to supply you with whatever you might need.*/
@79 = ~Farewell, <CHARNAME>. May Tyr guide your steps.~ [ARIBE078]
@80 = ~NP: Sometimes I think that Dester and his Helmits are more of a hindrance than a help. But Fentik assures that they give the city hope, and sometimes people desperately need hope. Anything else,<CHARNAME> ?~ [ARIBE119] /*Sometimes I think Desther and his Helmites do more to hinder my efforts than help them. But Fenthick assures me they bring hope to the city, and hope is something the people desperately need.*/
@81 = ~My faith in the power of Tyr is strong, yet I understand sometimes the Gods rely on mortal means to accomplish their ends. Mere blessings and prayers are not enough to end this plague, despite what the Helmites believe.~ [ARIBE118]
@82 = ~NP: The plague does not appear to be transmitted by contact with a sick person. Healers communicate with the sick and stay healthy, and some lock themselves at home and still get sick. We've quarantined the city, but that's more to help keep the guards in order. It does little to help contain the plague, although some parts of the city are uninfected.~ [ARIBE094] /*We have quarantined the city, but that is mostly to help the watch maintain order. It has done little to halt the spread, though some districts remain unaffected.*/
@83 = ~NP: We've quarantined the city, but that's more to help keep the guards in order. It does little to contain the plague, although some parts of the city are almost uninfected. The plague does not appear to be transmitted by contact with a sick person. Healers communicate with the sick and stay healthy, and some lock themselves at home and still get sick.~ [ARIBE097] /*We have quarantined the city, but that is mostly to help maintain order. It has done little to halt the spread of the disease - though some districts remain largely unaffected.*/
@84 = ~Is there more you would know? Any information about the creatures I can provide to help you locate them will be freely given, of course.~ [ARIBE101]
@85 = ~Tell me about the cockatrice.~
@86 = ~Tell me about the yuan-ti.~
@87 = ~Tell me about the intellect devourer.~
@88 = ~Tell me about the dryad.~
@89 = ~You gonna kill monsters for make cure?~
@90 = ~Me not need nothing else 'bout Waterdeep monsters.~
@91 = ~NP: Perhaps this is where the horror lies. The disease broke out all of a sudden, no cure was found, and until we have all the Waterdeep creatures, it will never be found. Is there anything else I can help you with?<CHARNAME> ?~ [ARIBE096] /*Perhaps that is what is so terrible about this affliction. There is no rhyme or reason to it, seemingly no way to guard against it and, until we have all the Waterdhavian creatures, no way to cure it.*/
@92 = ~A cockatrice resembles a hybrid of chicken, lizard, and bat. They are repulsive animals that can petrify opponents. You must be extremely cautious when dealing with this beast.~ [ARIBE102]
@93 = ~NP: The yuan-ti race is a cross between a human and a snake. Serpentine and human traits can be mixed in them in any way. They are very intelligent and many of them practice magic. It is said that some of them are even able to change their shape.~ [ARIBE103] /*The yuan-ti are a race of beings whose bloodlines are a mixture of human and snake. They can be any combination of snake and human characteristics.*/
@94 = ~The intellect devourer is a truly horrible entity, resembling a large fleshy brain with legs. It can dominate the minds of its victims so that it may devour their very thoughts.~ [ARIBE104]
@95 = ~NP: She looks like everyone else: a beautiful, elusive forest fairy whose charms attract much more than her looks. She gladly agreed to help us, having learned about our trouble. But in the city she is awkward and uncomfortable. I think she fled in terror when attacked, and now she is lost among the unfamiliar streets and buildings of Neverwinter.~ [ARIBE106] /*She is like most of her kind: a beautiful, elusive forest sprite whose charms transcend mere physical appearance. Out of charity, she came willingly to help us when she learned of our need.*/
@96 = ~NP: A drop of blood, a feather, and a lock of hair can all be obtained without harming creatures. Only a terrible brain-eater will have to be killed to get his brain. Do you want to know something else? Any information that will help you find the creatures is at your disposal.~ [ARIBE109] /*A single drop of blood, a single scale, a lock of hair - all these can be collected with no harm to the creatures. Only the monstrously evil intellect devourer needs be slain to collect the reagent.*/
@97 = ~Is there something else I can help you with, <CHARNAME>?~ [ARIBE083]
@98 = ~Welcome, <CHARNAME>. Do you have news of the missing Waterdhavian creatures? Or is there something else you need?~ [ARIBE123]
@99 = ~I need to talk to you.~
@100 = ~I found a note you might be interested in.~
@101 = ~I require temple services.~
@102 = ~I am injured. Can you heal my wounds?~
@103 = ~Of course, <CHARNAME>. I will do my best to help with whatever you need to know.~ [ARIBE124]
@104 = ~NP: Let's see... Hmm... You did the right thing bringing this paper here. Take this to Fentik - he's in charge of exposing the enemy. He will be very interested to look at this paper, no doubt. What else can I do for you?~ [ARIBE142] /*Take it to Fenthick - he is the one in charge of unmasking the enemy behind all this. He will find your note most interesting, I am sure.*/
@105 = ~Aribeth looks you over, then raises her hands in praise of the Even-Handed, Tyr. You begin to feel better.~
@106 = ~NP: Welcome back,<CHARNAME> . You found the first being, and we are all deeply indebted to you. Only one step separates us from the final goal, but it gives me hope. And I know that with your help, Neverwinter will be saved!~ [ARIBE144] /*It is but one small step toward our ultimate goal, but it gives me hope. And I know with your help Neverwinter shall yet be saved!*/
@107 = ~NP: One of the bards at Castle Nevers is writing a song about your adventures in search of the second substance,<CHARNAME> . Even Lord Nasher himself once sang this tune. You gain fame<CHARNAME> .~ [ARIBE147] /*One of the bards here in Castle Never is composing a song to honor your adventures during the recovery of the second reagent, <CHARNAME>.*/
@108 = ~NP: Your arrival is always welcome<CHARNAME> . Do you have news of the fourth Waterdeep creature this time? We are all looking forward to being found. As soon as we have the fourth substance, we will immediately arrange the ritual of preparing the medicine.~ [ARIBE150] /*We are all eagerly awaiting its recovery. As soon as we have the fourth component we can begin the ritual to create the cure.*/
@109 = ~I have the last of the reagents from the Waterdhavian creatures.~
@110 = ~Truly the heart of a hero beats within your chest, <CHARNAME>! Of all who have sought the creatures you have proven yourself above everyone else!~ [ARIBE152]
@111 = ~NP: Now we have all four substances. Quicker,<CHARNAME> , we have little time. You have earned a place of honor among those who tried to help Neverwinter during these difficult times. Together with us you will participate in the ritual of making medicine. Are you ready to go to the ritual chamber? We need to go as soon as possible.~ [ARIBE155] /*You have earned a place of honor among those who sought to aid Neverwinter in these dark times. You will stand with us as the ritual to create the cure is performed.*/
@112 = ~I'll be right back.~
@113 = ~NP: Sorry, I can't discuss Neverwinter business with you. Let it come to me<CHARNAME> I will only talk to him.~ /*Now you make fun of me. So be it, <CHARNAME>, I shall speak plainly.*/
