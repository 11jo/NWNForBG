@0 = ~Well, hello there. I fear you have "mistaken" my unlocked door as an invitation to enter. Forgive me if this was misleading, as it was not my intent to allow entry to just any stranger off the street. Please accept my apologies, but I should appreciate it if you would leave. Mine husband       is one of the guards and I should think he would be perturbed if there were people milling about his house when he got home.~/*你好啊。 “我相信你是把我认成别人了。” 你是对的，我很抱歉……轻视那位女士并不是我的意图，那完全是一个悲惨的故事，让我想想其他的。 蛇小姐？蛇人？真是的，如果他们真的要危害那些人，他们必须为了医治而分开呀！*/
@1 = ~I should not like to appear rude, but you have entered mine house without permission. I hardly think merely having an unlocked door is an invitation. Leave lest my husband extricate you himself when he returns from guard duty.~/*我想看看你有什么。 正在考虑邀请。 我已经说过我不喜欢巴拉姆和库尔泽。*/
@2 = ~You must be a considerable fool to enter this house uninvited. Best that you should leave, because if I call the guard there is a good chance my husband will be with them. No doubt he would expel you from his own house with... extra vigor.~/*你还不算是笨到家，我做这个完全是因为钱。 但是我仍担心困难横阻前面，你的能力及勇气将会被考验。 也许我可以从主人那里放你自由。*/
@3 = ~My husband should be here soon; I would suggest that you leave.~/*给我一个放你一马的理由！*/
@4 = ~I wish I could run away with you darling, but my husband can be such a jealous man. I wouldn't want to arouse his wrath. Take this ring, with which you may always remember me.~/*你改变不了你之前所做的事，但是你可以改变你所走的路。 要是我不干呢？ 我同意你所做的……而且我很难过。*/
@5 = ~离我远一点！~
@6 = ~I told you my husband would be here!~
/*到我这边。过来帮我！*/
