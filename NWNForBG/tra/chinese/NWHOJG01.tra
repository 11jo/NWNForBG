@0 = ~You better step back. Only those in the company of Mr. Hodge are allowed to enter his estate.~
@1 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I'm on duty, so I really shouldn't be chatting... but it gets awful boring just standing here. Usually I'm cleaning inside. Ask your questions and I'll do my best to answer them.~ 
@4 = ~Who are you?~
@5 = ~Do you know anything about the Wailing Death?~
@6 = ~Anything interesting going on here in Blacklake?~
@7 = ~Why can't I enter the estate?~
@8 = ~Goodbye. Do as you will. I'm not paid enough to worry about this.~
@9 = ~I'm just a guard trying to do his duty. Well, actually I'm not much of a guard. I was the butler, but the door guard fell to the plague. So now I'm standing out here, pretending that I'm threatening. I don't even think I'm getting paid more for this.~ 
@10 = ~I only know what everyone's been saying. We're all doomed unless Aribeth and her crew can find a cure. Nothing you haven't heard before, I'd bet. Was there anything else?~ 
@11 = ~Interesting? What would I know about interesting? This is the first I've been outside in weeks. I'm usually inside, minding the dusting and whatnot. Sorry, but I can't help you there. Anything else you need?~ 
@12 = ~I'm looking for work.~
@13 = ~Let's go back to my other questions.~
@14 = ~Well, actually, I don't much care one way or the other. If you are set on entering, I'm not going to get in your way. I'm not really much of a fighter.~
@15 = ~I ain't doing any hiring myself, and I don't know anyone who is. I'm just a butler... guard too, I guess. Anything else you need?~
@16 = ~Ask your questions and I'll do my best to answer them.~
@17 = ~The door has already been opened anyway. You could just walk in if you wanted. I wouldn't do it, though. It's not safe.~
@18 = ~Why isn't it safe?~
@19 = ~You really won't do anything if I go in?~
@20 = ~I'm supposed to be the butler, after all. I'm only filling in because the door guard died of plague. I wouldn't go in, though. It's not safe.~
@21 = ~The guards inside are real tough. I'm not sure why Hodge didn't put them out here. Maybe he wants them as a surprise for burglars. I don't know. They attack on sight. Nothing more than killers, really. Working as a guard just lets them hurt people legally. I don't like them much.~ 
@22 = ~I told you, I'm no guard. I don't make enough gold to get in your way. I say it ain't safe, but what you do is your business.~
@23 = ~Get lost! Only guests of Mr. Hodge are allowed in, and as low as he might be, I don't think he would stoop to associate with your type.~
