@0 = ~So Lord Nasher gambled our fate on the likes of you, did he? Why, if I was Lord... !~
@1 = ~You militia folk must enjoy waving your weapons around like that! You can't cut or bash through the stink of the burning corpses, though.~
@2 = ~Psst! <PRO_RACE> friend! I heard something about a plot to overthrow Lord Nasher - spread the word!~
@3 = ~NP: This very Howling Death is just Lord Nasher's plot to get rid of everyone and everyone, that is us!~ /*This here Wailing - it's just a plot of Lord Nasher's to get rid of good <PRO_RACE>-folk like us!*/
@4 = ~You're a good-looking chap. Are you with the resistance?~
@5 = ~Lord Nasher hasn't made an appearance for weeks. Who can blame him? It stinks of burning bodies out here.~
@6 = ~Can't you use magic to get rid of the smell of the corpse burn? Or maybe you spellthrowing types used to it?~
@7 = ~What good have you clerics done us! Well, the city STINKS to the heavens. That's a start, I guess.~
@8 = ~It's because of outlanders like you that we all caught this bloody Wailing...~
@9 = ~Be careful around the Core - people are getting upset about how long it's taking to get a cure.~
@10 = ~Just between you and I, I wouldn't trust anyone around these parts, least of all those in charge.~
@11 = ~So you're Nasher's lackeys, are you? You'll smell like the rest of us after a day near the corpse burning pits.~
@12 = ~The church, the government, the militia, they've all turned on us. All we've got is ourselves...~
@13 = ~This is what we've become, is it? Guttersnipes and harpies, all of us...~
