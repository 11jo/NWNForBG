@0 = ~Thank you for saving me... if that is indeed what you have done. I do not know you, or your motives.~ [NWDARA51]
@1 = ~Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you.~
@2 = ~And I don't know you. Should I care?~
@3 = ~You'll die if you need to.~
@4 = ~It is good to hear a kind voice. These men have not been gentle, and I fear their questions were growing ever more insistent. I am Dara'nei, and I am at your mercy. I'd hoped you were sent by Vengaul, but I haven't heard from him. His auction was called off.~ 
@5 = ~I want to ask about you.~
@6 = ~What you know about auction.~
@7 = ~I want to ask about Vengaul.~
@8 = ~Goodbye.~
@9 = ~I have no answer. You have me at a disadvantage, though, and I must trust that you will not harm me. I am Dara'nei, and I am at your mercy. I'd hoped you were sent by Vengaul, but I haven't heard from him. His auction was called off.~ 
@10 = ~I can't fight you any more than I could my previous captors. At least they had reason to hold me. I know very little about you. I am Dara'nei, and I am at your mercy. I'd hoped you were sent by Vengaul, but I haven't heard from him. His auction was called off.~ 
@11 = ~Very well. As I said, my name is Dara'nei. I am... in service to Vengaul Bloodsail, the Scarlet Blade and foil of Lord Nasher Alagondar.~
@12 = ~Why were you imprisoned here?~
@13 = ~I have a question first, if you don't mind? Who do you serve? I won't say anything if you intend to use it against people I care about.~
@14 = ~I am acting as a guard under Aribeth and Nasher.~
@15 = ~Perhaps I'm here to kill you. Perhaps I haven't decided yet.~
@16 = ~That is none of your business.~
@17 = ~More than I care to, at this point. I wish Vengaul had never found that creature. It has caused no end of trouble.~
@18 = ~What creature do you mean?~
@19 = ~Back to my previous questions.~
@20 = ~Vengaul Bloodsail, the Scarlet Blade. He is the former leader of the mutinous Bloodsailors, and he is my betrothed. We have been apart for far too long.~
@21 = ~Why have the Bloodsailors mutinied?~
@22 = ~Where is Vengaul Bloodsail now?~
@23 = ~Farewell. I will remain here. Vengaul will find me when the time is right to do so. If his game doesn't get even further out of hand...~
@24 = ~These were Callik's men. He was Vengaul's Lieutenant, and he wanted them to interrogate me and find out where Vengaul is hiding. It would seem that Callik is no longer willing to follow my Vengaul, but I certainly didn't think he would stoop to this.~ 
@25 = ~I see. I begin to understand what your interest in Vengaul and his Bloodsailors may be. Ask your questions. I will try to answer.~
@26 = ~They why would you bother to save me? Perhaps you don't even know the answer, but I cannot trust someone so openly threatening. If that is your attitude then I refuse to say any more. I cannot allow my petty life to endanger my beloved Vengaul.~ 
@27 = ~How can I trust you when you when you won't do me this simple courtesy? Is it so much to ask? If that is your attitude then I refuse to say any more. I cannot allow my petty life to endanger my beloved Vengaul.~
@28 = ~Vengaul said it was a Cockatrice brought from Waterdeep and that it had a connection to the plague. He even claimed it was part of a cure. He found it in the streets while the city guards were busy with the plague and whatever mess happened at the Academy. It would have been lost if not for him. He was going to make sure it was returned to the appropriate city officials, but first he would invite Lord Nasher to this "auction." It was a game to Vengaul.~
@29 = ~Lord Nasher? Why would he come?~
@30 = ~I will answer if I am able.~
@31 = ~It would appear that they have grown tired of Vengaul. His methods of doing things are sometimes... difficult to understand. They don't respect his grandiose plans like they used to. He has always stressed how things should be done with style, but now they just want profit.~ 
@32 = ~Who is leading the uprising?~ 
@33 = ~I can't say for certain, but he is an old pirate and set in his ways. He said I would know where to find him, and I have a few ideas. Vengaul is on the run, so he'll go to where he thinks he's safe. He'll either go to the Silver Sails or the Aqueducts. I think both places lead to an underground cache of his.~
@34 = ~If you help me find him, I will spare his life.~
@35 = ~I want to find him. I can't promise he'll be safe.~
@36 = ~Tell me where he is or I will kill you!~
@37 = ~The two of them are old rivals. They were always looking for ways to show up the other. Vengaul figured Nasher couldn't get out of this one. See, Vengaul wanted Nasher to have to come to this stupid little tavern and admit in front of everyone that he had been outdone, that he needed Vengaul. He would have just given the Cockatrice back after that. It was all about the game to him.~
@38 = ~Idiot! He was playing with people's lives!~
@39 = ~This game of his would not have pleased his Bloodsailors.~
@40 = ~He plays with lives all the time, as does Nasher. That's what rulers do. The stakes were just a bit too high this time. See, Vengaul's men never sent the message to Lord Nasher. Instead, his most trusted lieutenant plotted to kill him. It's all a mess now.~ 
@41 = ~No, his game with Nasher has become a bit more serious than he would have liked. The stakes were too high this time. See, Vengaul's men never sent the message to Lord Nasher. Instead, his most trusted lieutenant plotted to kill him. It's all a mess now.~ 
@42 = ~Vengaul would have given the creature back. He's not the kind to let innocents suffer. It just got out of hand.~
@43 = ~Callik, Vengaul's lieutenant. He didn't approve of this auction, so now he's trying to seize the Bloodsailors for his own. He doesn't appreciate artful schemes. Callik will kill Vengaul if he finds him. The Bloodsailors will become a much more vicious group under him. Vengaul always maintained some civility.~
@44 = ~Where Callik now?~
@45 = ~I want to believe. He really did mean for his auction to help... he just wanted the right amount of flash as well. Very well... find him.~
@46 = ~So you hope to entice me by saying you may or may not kill him? I suppose it is the only honesty I have seen today.~
@47 = ~If you are the type to do something like that, you'll probably kill me anyway! I won't doom my beloved Vengaul too! I don't know how to enter the Aqueducts and I won't give you my k... I mean, I won't help you get into the Silver Sails!~ 
@48 = ~He couldn't wait for his men to finish with me. He's probably made a guess as to where Vengaul is, and has gone to try and find him.~
@49 = ~Take this locket. It was a present from him. He said it was a key, and it would let me enter the Silver Sails if I needed to find him. The Silver Sails is in the west central area of the Docks. There's a passage inside. Vengaul said it is safe... for him, at least.~
@50 = ~I have already given you my locket. Vengaul said it was a key, and it would let me enter the Silver Sails if I needed to find him. The Silver Sails is in the west central area of the Docks. There's a passage inside. Vengaul said it is safe... for him, at least.~ 
@51 = ~You have returned. What more can I tell you? What more do you think I know?~ [NWDOOR52]
@52 = ~Who is it now? More people to threaten me? I shouldn't have said anything. I just hoped someone would help... but I can't trust anyone with Vengaul gone!~ [NWDOOR50]
