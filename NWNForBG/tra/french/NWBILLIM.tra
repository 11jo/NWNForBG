@0 = ~Get lost. Can't you see I'm spending a day with the family?! Stare right into its eyes, boys. Show no fear!~
@1 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~No. I am in no mood. Take a walk.~
@4 = ~Yes, yes, just go.~
@5 = ~Most certainly not. I don't waste my time with guards or other rabble. Go protect some wench. I don't need you here.~
@6 = ~Yes, I see. Too busy scaring the animals and your children.~ 
@7 = ~What did you say to me? Listen, <GIRLBOY>, I am important. I don't need to take that kind of abuse from the likes of you.~
@8 = ~I would guess you are afraid of the plague. At least here you still think you have control.~
@9 = ~Don't worry. I won't waste my time on you.~
@10 = ~No, You misunderstand. I approve. The children should know where they stand.~
@11 = ~That is quite the proclamation. Right out of the blue you thought of that, hmm? Or perhaps you've been saving it for just such an occasion as this? You sound worse than that fool of a druid, Nyatar, talking all high and mighty, not considering commerce or tradition. That kind of... of... "do-goodery" just makes me sick.~ 
@12 = ~Er... yes... yes, that is what I intended. Especially in these strained times. The beasts are below and we are above. Remembering that gives us strength.~
@13 = ~Oh yeah, and yelling at animals in stinky cages is best way to show that.~
@14 = ~Well said. Sorry to have bothered you.~
@15 = ~Go on, leave me be. I don't need this... this preaching from you. Not now. Not in times like this.~
@16 = ~Well... you don't want to cause the beast too much discomfort... I don't mean...~
@17 = ~Oh, no pain, of course. Just let them rot in there as a symbol of your superiority.~
@18 = ~Now see here, I don't need your veiled insults!~
@19 = ~I know you don't. You make enough of an ass of yourself alone.~
@20 = ~Forgive my jest. Farewell.~
@21 = ~You sound worse than that fool of a druid, Nyatar, talking all high and mighty, not considering commerce or tradition. That kind of... of... "do-goodery" just makes me sick.~
