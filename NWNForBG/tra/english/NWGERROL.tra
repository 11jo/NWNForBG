@0 = ~Hello, <GIRLBOY>. You best be careful treadin' the road 'round these parts. A dangerous place, these days. Listen to old Gerrol.~ [NWGER053]
@1 = ~You're Gerrol? Your son mentioned you.~
@2 = ~What do you do around here?~
@3 = ~What's so dangerous about this area?~
@4 = ~Could you give me some directions?~
@5 = ~I'll be on my way.~
@6 = ~He did, did he? He's a fine lad, he is. I expect, then, that you're some manner of adventurer that he thought could help us, aye?~
@7 = ~What kind of help do you need?~
@8 = ~He seemed to think so, yes.~
@9 = ~Not so fast, old man.~
@10 = ~Farming, mostly. Though to be perfectly honest, there hasn't been much of that since this area became so dangerous. It wasn't always this way, of course. In recent days it seems like the entire north is under siege. All us common folk can try to do is help each other as much as we can.~ /*It wasn't always this way, of course. In recent days it seems like the entire north is under siege. All us common folk can try to do is help each other as much as we can.*/
@11 = ~The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don't trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, mind you, they've become plenty brave. For weeks, now, they've been attacking anyone passing through these parts. Attacked the farm a few times, too... that's when they made off with my wife.~ /*The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don't trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, mind you, they've become plenty brave.*/
@12 = ~I suppose so. What are you looking for?~
@13 = ~Where is the nearest inn?~
@14 = ~Can you tell me the way to Luskan?~
@15 = ~I'm told there are caves in this area.~
@16 = ~Let us speak of something else.~
@17 = ~NP: Yes, be careful if you go to the hills<SIRMAAM> . Good luck.~ /*Aye, do be careful if you go into the hills, then, <GIRLBOY>. I wish you well.*/
@18 = ~Well, now, that's a bit of a tale. I'm surprised the boy didn't fill you in.~
@19 = ~It's a dangerous thing to ask of anyone, but it might be worth your while, <GIRLBOY>. Let me fill you in, in case the boy didn't.~
@20 = ~I didn't mean to imply that you'd agreed to anything, <GIRLBOY>. I'm just pleased that you've come. Let me explain what's been happening, here.~
@21 = ~I figure it's all that Dergiab's doing. Damn ogre will get what's coming to him one way or another, I swear it!~
@22 = ~What's this about your wife?~
@23 = ~Who is this Dergiab?~
@24 = ~Why would Luskan stop patrolling?~
@25 = ~Why don't you just leave?~
@26 = ~Leah is her name. She was taken from the farm one evening when the boy and I were out scouting the hills. Nothing we could have done about it. Them creatures have never shown any interest in taking folk before... I'm not even sure why they should start now. Dergiab's behind it for sure, though.~ /*Leah is her name. She was taken from the farm one evening when the boy and I were out scouting the hills. Nothing we could have done about it.*/
@27 = ~Dergiab is an ogre mage... a rather cunning sort who's decided he's just the critter to lead all these other monsters. How he got it into his head I haven't a clue, but from what I can tell he's gone and built himself an army. What he intends to do with it scares me just a little. I went and sent a warning off to my old friend Aarin Gend, but I haven't heard back from him yet. I s'pose he's got more important things on his plate right now, all things considered.~ /*I went and sent a warning off to my old friend Aarin Gend, but I haven't heard back from him yet. I s'pose he's got more important things on his plate right now, all things considered.*/
@28 = ~You know Aarin Gend?~
@29 = ~You haven't heard? Since Neverwinter had its plague, that Luskan's gone and shut their walls up tight. No one goes in, no one comes out. I never liked their soldiers much... like bandits, sometimes, the way they act. Since they stopped patrolling, however, it makes you realize what worse things they kept in check.~ /*I never liked their soldiers much... like bandits, sometimes, the way they act. Since they stopped patrolling, however, it makes you realize what worse things they kept in check.*/
@30 = ~I would gladly head to the city until things settle down. I won't leave without my wife, Leah, however... or at least until I know for sure what happened to her. And failing that, I'll make sure Dergiab pays for crossing me an' mine. That's why I sent the boy to Port Llast to find adventurers... one of them folk should be able to do something.~ /*And failing that, I'll make sure Dergiab pays for crossing me an' mine. That's why I sent the boy to Port Llast to find adventurers... one of them folk should be able to do something.*/
@31 = ~Perhaps I could help.~
@32 = ~I can only pray that she's all right, yet. I'll get her back, somehow... and then that ogre will pay for all the grief he's caused me.~
@33 = ~Maybe you could, at that. I can reward you, if that's what you're keen for. I'll warn you, though... you wouldn't be the first adventurer to head into the hills.~
@34 = ~There have been other adventurers?~
@35 = ~What kind of reward are we talking?~
@36 = ~I have some questions.~
@37 = ~NP: Ill take care of it.~ /*Me go and get it.*/
@38 = ~I have other things to do.~
@39 = ~Aye, I do. An old friend, I said. You don't think I've spent my whole life as a farmer, do you? Ha! We all settle down some day, <GIRLBOY>. If I were in my younger days, I'd go into those caves and find Leah for myself. I wish I could. As it stands, I'll have to wait for some younger adventurer to take up the task for me.~ /*If I were in my younger days, I'd go into those caves and find Leah for myself. I wish I could. As it stands, I'll have to wait for some younger adventurer to take up the task for me.*/
@40 = ~If Luskan was keeping order, Dergiab never would've gotten it in his head to make his move... and my wife would still be here.~
@41 = ~Well, the closest inn would the Alliance Arms Inn in Port Llast. That shouldn't take you too much time to get to. Other than that, the only inn I can think of would be the Green Griffon Inn outside of Luskan, to the north past the hills. If you're really strapped, you're more'n welcome to stay here in my farm. There's not much I can offer you, however, <GIRLBOY>.~ /*Other than that, the only inn I can think of would be the Green Griffon Inn outside of Luskan, to the north past the hills.*/
@42 = ~It's not much farther to the north, <GIRLBOY>. Just keep on the road an' you'll find it, sure enough. I can tell you right now that you're wasting your time. Luskan is shut up tight... they'll just send you to wait at the Green Griffon Inn, is all. It's up to you, though.~ /*I can tell you right now that you're wasting your time. Luskan is shut up tight... they'll just send you to wait at the Green Griffon Inn, is all. It's up to you, though.*/
@43 = ~NP: Yes. These places are full of caves, and in the caves of different creatures. The nearest entrance is in the hills to the southeast of here. There are also two caves to the south. If you cant fight seriously yet, dont go into those hills. There are many dangerous creatures there.~ /*Aye. Plenty of caves in these parts, and full of creatures of all sorts. Nearest entrance is in the hills just to the north.*/
@44 = ~NP: How else can old Gerrol help you,<SIRMAAM> ?~ /*Something else old Gerrol can do for you, then, <GIRLBOY>?*/
@45 = ~Aye, a few have passed this way and headed into the hills to check out the creatures for themselves. None have returned, I'm afraid to say.~
@46 = ~To be honest, I haven't much left from my adventuring days. I'd be happy to offer what gold I have, though, to have some proof of what happened to my wife... or, better yet, to have her returned. I'd also offer gold for Dergiab's head, to know for sure that he won't be pestering anyone else in these parts. I know it's not much... chances are Dergiab will have plenty to loot, himself.~ /*To be honest, I haven't much left from my adventuring days. I'd be happy to offer what gold I have, though, to have some proof of what happened to my wife... or, better yet, to have her returned.*/
@47 = ~NP: Yes? Ill tell you all I can<SIRMAAM> .~ /*Aye? I'll answer whatever I can, <GIRLBOY>.*/
@48 = ~Tell me of this Dergiab.~
@49 = ~Where do I find these caves?~
@50 = ~Do you know anything about a cult in the region?~
@51 = ~Do you think your wife is still alive?~
@52 = ~I don't have any more questions.~
@53 = ~I'd be grateful for it. Find my wife or bring me proof of what's happened to her... and bring me Dergiab's head, if you can. Either would be a great service.~

@55 = ~If that's your wish. It's mighty dangerous, after all. If you happen across my wife... or her remains... I'd be glad to know of it. Same goes if you encounter that Dergiab. I'd pay gold for his head. But I'm sure you've your own matters to attend to, <GIRLBOY>.~ /*Same goes if you encounter that Dergiab. I'd pay gold for his head. But I'm sure you've your own matters to attend to, <GIRLBOY>.*/
@56 = ~Well, he's an ogre mage... smarter than his brutish cousins and a fair bit more powerful, too. He can become invisible and has plenty of spells, I'd say. Dergiab's led a lot of the other creatures for quite some time, now. Never been brave enough to really do anything drastic, however... I'm not sure why he would start now.~ /*Dergiab's led a lot of the other creatures for quite some time, now. Never been brave enough to really do anything drastic, however... I'm not sure why he would start now.*/
@57 = ~There's a few of them spread out in the hills. They all connect together underground in a large warren, however... be sure you don't get lost. There's one entrance in the hills just north of here. Most like Dergiab's followers will find you before you find them.~ /*There's a few of them spread out in the hills. They all connect together underground in a large warren, however... be sure you don't get lost.*/
@58 = ~A cult? You mean in connection to Dergiab and these creatures? Hmm. Can't say that I do, really... though that'd explain Dergiab's sudden ambition. To be honest, I always thought Dergiab fashioned himself as a bit of a god amongst them other monsters. I'd be surprised if he allied with anyone else. You never know, however.~ /*To be honest, I always thought Dergiab fashioned himself as a bit of a god amongst them other monsters. I'd be surprised if he allied with anyone else. You never know, however.*/
@59 = ~I... I certainly hope so, <GIRLBOY>. It all depends on what Dergiab wants with his prisoners. I've braced myself for the worst, to be honest.~
@60 = ~NP: Well, well... As I said, I will give you a reasonable reward for your help. I suggested this to all other adventurers as well.~ /*Fair enough. Like I said, I'll give you what reward I can, if you help me out. It's the same offer I've made to any other adventurer that's come by.*/
@61 = ~Well, hello to you. Were you the one I told about them monsters bothering us around here - the ones who took my wife, Leah? Do you bring word?~ [NWGER055]
@62 = ~The monster's leader, Dergiab, is dead. I have his head.~
@63 = ~I have Leah's ring right here. She's dead.~
@64 = ~I see Leah made it back safely.~
@65 = ~I would like some directions.~
@66 = ~NP: So far there is no news.~ /*No. No regrets.*/
@67 = ~I've no time for your errands.~
@68 = ~That is a relief, then, to be sure. We'll have none of his terrorizing anyone else in these parts. Thank you, <GIRLBOY>... I hope this bit of gold will do as a reward.~
@69 = ~I think killing Dergiab is worth a bit larger reward, no?~
@70 = ~I might have to rough you up and see what else you got in there.~
@71 = ~NP: I dont need a reward. Happy to help.~ /*No reward is necessary. I was glad to do it.*/
@72 = ~It will do.~
@73 = ~Ah. I... I had thought as much. I suppose it is good to know, at least, though it will be difficult to tell the boy. Thank you, <GIRLBOY>, for bringing me a bit of peace of mind. I hope this bit of gold will suffice for the trouble you've taken.~ /*Ah. I... I had thought as much. I suppose it is good to know, at least, though it will be difficult to tell the boy.*/
@74 = ~I think peace of mind is worth a bit more, no?~
@75 = ~I think you can cough up a bit more. Wouldn't want to get rough.~
@76 = ~NP: I cant take money for bad news.~ /*Me not take gold for sad news.*/
@77 = ~That she did. She has returned safe and sound, which is more than I even thought possible. Thank you, <GIRLBOY>... I shall be forever grateful. I hope this bit of gold will do as a reward?~
@78 = ~I think your wife's safety is worth more than that, no?~
@79 = ~What is it you want me to do again?~
@80 = ~NP: Ill tell you everything I know. What are you looking for?~ /*Tell me what you've heard about Desther.*/
@81 = ~Well, come and see me when you have something to tell me. Be careful! This area is dangerous.~
@82 = ~NP: As you wish. I only asked. If you find out something please let me know.~ /*As you wish, <GIRLBOY>. I was only asking. If you do discover something, please do tell me.*/
@83 = ~I imagine you got plenty from Dergiab, himself, no? I would love to give you more... I just can't spare it.~
@84 = ~NP: Okay, I agree.~ /*Okay, me go now.*/
@85 = ~And here I thought things would be safer with the monsters gone. Sigh... fair enough. It may be a bit greedy of you, but it's not like you didn't earn it.~

@87 = ~It is the least I could do.~
@88 = ~I have little enough left to give you, <GIRLBOY>. My wealth from my adventuring days is long gone.~
@89 = ~NP: Hmm. I dont remember that the search for adventure was to intimidate old people. But so be it ... here. This is all I can afford.~ /*Hmph. I don't remember adventuring being about bullying the common man. But have it your way... here. It is all I can afford.*/

@91 = ~NP: You... you<MALEFEMALE> real, thats what<SIRMAAM> . Thank you.~ /*You... you are a good <MANWOMAN>, <GIRLBOY>. I appreciate it.*/
@92 = ~Aye, perhaps you are right. Here, <GIRLBOY>... let me give you a little more, then. It is all I have.~

@94 = ~I told you this already, didn't I, <GIRLBOY>? I suppose there's no harm in repeating the tale. The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don't trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, they've become plenty brave. For weeks, now, they've been attacking anyone passing through these parts. Attacked the farm a few times, too... that's when they made off with my wife, Leah.~ /*The hills in this area are home to creatures of all sorts... bugbears, goblins and the like. Normally they don't trouble us much. Since Luskan stopped patrolling the area, they've become plenty brave.*/
@95 = ~All of this is likely the doing of the leader of them monsters, Dergiab. No one will be safe until he's dead. You bring me word of my wife or his head... I'll reward you for either.~
@96 = ~NP: I... I hope so. It all depends on what Dergiab wants from his captives. Although, to be honest, Im ready for the worst.~ /*I... I certainly hope so, <GIRLBOY>. It all depends on what Dergiab wants with his prisoners. I've braced myself for the worst, to be honest.*/
@97 = ~Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things seem a lot safer around here, but I do miss Leah dearly.~ [NWGER050]
@98 = ~NP: But Leah is back.~ /*I see Leah made it back safely.*/
@99 = ~Most pleased to see you again, friend. Things are just about to right with Leah's return to the farm. To think, I thought her dead for sure.~ [NWGER051]
@100 = ~I'll be forever grateful for what you've done for the area, too. It's safe once more. You and yours are always welcome at our humble farm.~
@101 = ~Things are just about right... but not quite. The area is still unsafe so long as Dergiab is still about.~
@102 = ~Hello. It's been mighty sad around here since you've confirmed the worst. My wife is dead. How go things with the monsters that killed her?~ [NWGER054]
