@0 = ~Who's this? Some poor soul straggling in off the diseased streets? Are you here to join our ranks and beg for an employer... or are you actually here to hire someone?~ [SHARWY51]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~And if I said I was looking for work?~
@3 = ~I might be looking for a henchman.~
@4 = ~NP: Now I don't have time to talk. Goodbye.~ /*I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.*/
@5 = ~My name is Sharwyn, and I call this city my home. I seek adventure and excitement... if you seek the same, you'd be smart to hire me to accompany you.~
@6 = ~You're a local girl, are you?~
@7 = ~And if I don't seek adventure and excitement?~
@8 = ~You seem pretty sure of yourself.~
@9 = ~And just what skills do you have?~
@10 = ~NP: No need to hold your breath. In this city where everyone is dropping like flies, the only ones with jobs are gravediggers and charlatans. You don't look like one or the other. Why not just say why you're really here?~ /*I'd say not to hold your breath. With everyone dropping like flies in this city, the only opportunity for employment is as a gravedigger or charlatan.*/
@11 = ~Why not tell me who you are, first?~
@12 = ~My business is my own.~
@13 = ~Is that so? Then I shall have to re-form my impression of you. Who are you, then, that you have coin to spare on hiring help?~
@14 = ~My name is <CHARNAME>. Pleased to meet you.~
@15 = ~Who are you that you interrogate possible employers?~
@16 = ~I never said I would hire *you*, did I?~
@17 = ~Have I scared you off already? Oh well. Do come back once you grow yourself a backbone, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@18 = ~Does that make a difference? I see people I've known my whole life falling to sickness all around me. I'd say that gives me more motivation than most. And, incidentally, I am no 'girl'.~
@19 = ~I find that hard to believe, somehow. You strike me as a bard, much like myself. Are you claiming that you have no wish to create you own legend similar to those you've heard your entire life?~
@20 = ~What is it to be, then? Duty and honor? Power and riches? Somehow I doubt it matters, as I'm willing to bet you'll find adventure and excitement along your path regardless of whether or not you seek them.~
@21 = ~I know what I want and I know what I like when I see it. Such as you... you're a fine-looking <PRO_RACE> man. We could make a fine team, you and I.~
@22 = ~I know what I want and I seek it out. We could make a fine team, you and I... if you're of a mind. Don't try and deny it.~
@23 = ~NP: I wield bardic magic, all skill, and tell the oldest tales... and with or without your help, I will achieve my glory in due time. Someday the bards will sing songs about me too. I guess this kind of talk may seem too arrogant to you,<LADYLORD> . If so, then I personally don't care. My path has been known to me for a long time... I gave up a rich life to become a bard.~ /*I suppose such talk may make me seem arrogant to you, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. If so, I don't particularly care. I've known the path I was on for a long time... I left behind a life of riches to live the life of a bard.*/
@24 = ~You left behind a life of riches?~
@25 = ~You're right... you do seem arrogant.~
@26 = ~I think such confidence is admirable.~
@27 = ~Fair enough. Perhaps I should introduce myself, first, then.~
@28 = ~NP: Hah! No. I would like to argue, but it's up to you... well, you won't regret it. Still, let's not put the wagon before the horses. Perhaps it would be better to introduce yourself first, right?~ /*But let's not get ahead of ourselves just yet. Perhaps a proper introduction is in order, yes?*/
@29 = ~NP: If my family managed to do everything according to plan, then I would now live quietly married to a rich man whom I could never respect, and would sit in tears from boredom in my huge mansion in the Black Lake region. How strange is this game of fate. Almost all of my family is dead, and Blackshire is full of scared fools, hiding their heads in the sand and hoping the plague won't touch them.~ /*If my own family had had its way, I would be by now comfortably married to a wealthy man I could never respect, bored to tears in my large Blacklake district mansion.*/
@30 = ~What do you know about the Blacklake district?~
@31 = ~I'm looking for someone to help me in my mission.~
@32 = ~Surprise, surprise, I don't care what you think. I've endured worse scorn from better, my <PRO_LADYLORD>, and survived.~
@33 = ~NP: Thank you. You too<MALEFEMALE> non-standard qualities, right?~ /*Thank you. You're not the typical sort of <PRO_MANWOMAN> yourself, are you?*/
@34 = ~NP: Great. There are crowds of rich, frightened nobles at every turn, who would rather fence off their area and pretend that the rest of the city simply does not exist than try to somehow help. There are those in the area who beg the rich to help the rest of the city, but their cries are directed to the deaf. Someday the plague will come to the rich, and then they will regret their selfishness.~ /*Plenty. It is full near to bursting with rich, frightened nobles who would rather wall off the district from everyone else and pretend the rest of the city doesn't exist than actually try to help.*/
@35 = ~Anything else you can tell me about Blacklake?~
@36 = ~So I understand. Might you be able to illuminate me as to the nature of this mission of yours?~
@37 = ~NP: I work for Lady Aribeth. I've been tasked with finding the missing creatures needed to obtain a cure for the plague.~ /*I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that might be used to find a plague cure.*/
@38 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@39 = ~NP: What else is there to say? This is perhaps the only place in the city that is almost not affected by plague and unrest, although it will not be easy to penetrate its walls. Perhaps there are some rough edges... in any place where there are rich people, you will find a place where they indulge their strange whims. Presumably, the local tavern also has a basement with special ... entertainment.~ /*There are some elements of seediness, perhaps... every place you find the rich, you find places where they can indulge their strangest tastes. I understand the local tavern's basement has its... distractions.*/
@40 = ~Aribeth is Lord Nasher's servant... so your mission is bound to be exciting. Hmmm. Yes, I think I'd rather like to join you... if the price is right.~
@41 = ~NP: Eh? Well, as you wish. If you work for Lady Aribeth, then this must be something very important. Aribeth serves Lord Nasher... so your mission must be exciting. hmmm. Yes, I think I'll join you... for the right price, of course.~ /*Aribeth is Lord Nasher's servant... so your mission is bound to be exciting. Hmmm. Yes, I think I'd rather like to join you... if the price is right.*/
@42 = ~One thing I know for sure, if you intend to get anywhere in Blacklake, you'd best rely on charm rather than muscle. Or maybe bring a companion who knows the terrain?~
@43 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some help to assist me on my mission.~
@44 = ~No thanks. Goodbye.~
@45 = ~NP: Be that as it may, my skills are not cheap. I will gladly follow you, and I will work with all my might... but only at my cost. Hmmm... What will be the price? Well, it looks like you<MALEFEMALE> of those who can be trusted. 750 gold and I'm yours.~ /*My skills don't come cheaply, however. I'll follow you gladly and to the best of my ability, my <PRO_LADYLORD>... provided my price is met.*/
@46 = ~Here's your 150 gold. Welcome aboard, Sharwyn.~
@47 = ~That seems a little expensive. I'll give you 100.~
@48 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@49 = ~Fair enough, my <PRO_LADYLORD>. I am at your disposal.~
@50 = ~Oh, fine, fine. I suppose a bit of gold now isn't the most important thing. I am at your disposal, my <PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@51 = ~I am not a crate of salt to be haggled over. 150 gold or nothing.~
@52 = ~You expect me to work for free, then? Don't be naive. Come back when you have something more to offer than promises, all right?~
@53 = ~Come back, have you? What do you require now?~ [SHARWY52]
@54 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@55 = ~NP: Questions? I may be from Neverwinter, but I'm not here to be pumped out of information by one of the newcomers. I am looking for a job here. Of course, I could tell you more about the Black Lake region, because I come from here ... but enough. It's better to just say whether you are going to hire an assistant or not.~ /*I suppose I could tell you a little about the Blacklake district, perhaps, as I am from there... but that's it. Otherwise let me know if you need some actual hired help or not.*/
@56 = ~So we meet again, <CHARNAME>. The others had told me Aribeth had recruited you to find the cultists... I can't say I'm surprised. You've acquired quite the reputation for yourself, haven't you?~ [SHARWY53]
@57 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Sharwyn.~
@58 = ~You again? What, are you following me around?~
@59 = ~Goodbye.~
@60 = ~NP: And why is that? Just because we didn't see eye to eye in Neverwinter, should I disappear from the map of Feirun? In case you haven't noticed, we've got a shortage of brave adventurers around here. Lady Aribeth approached me at the Sword Fair to hire me on behalf of Lord Nasher... as well as you, I presume.~ /*And why is that? Just because we went our separate ways in Neverwinter, I'm supposed to disappear off the face of Faerun? If you haven't noticed, there's a shortage of good adventurers.*/
@61 = ~Like I have nothing better to do, I suppose? No, I've my own skills, thank you... and my own reasons for being here.~
@62 = ~If you need me, you know where I am.~
@63 = ~It looks to me like Lord Nasher is pulling out all the stops to find this cult. The search in Neverwinter is immense, and we mercenaries have been sent to Port Llast to join the effort with you and Aribeth. Lucky us.~
@64 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@65 = ~NP: How much will it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@66 = ~NP: In fact, I was paid a handsome sum for my services to Lord Nasher. This is another opportunity to gain glory, in my opinion... despite the fact that I was ordered to simply offer help to you and Aribeth. So... do you need my help?~ /*It's another chance at acquiring some fame, in my eyes... even though I've been told to merely offer assistance to you and Aribeth, for now. So... do you need my help?*/
@67 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@68 = ~I could use someone by my side.~
@69 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@70 = ~NP: A cult can be almost anywhere. Maybe you should look among the hills at the crossroads, just as you exit the city. I have heard more than once about monsters raiding the roads in the area.~ /*The cult could be practically anywhere. You may want to look in the hills by the Green Griffon Inn... I've heard many tales of monsters raiding the roads nearby in force.*/
@71 = ~Monsters?~
@72 = ~It's about time you asked. I'm at your disposal, <CHARNAME>.~
@73 = ~NP: Mostly bugbears and orcs. However, they say they are controlled by people, which is very strange. In any case, ever since Luskan's mind was set on his own affairs, the surrounding provinces have been the target of constant raids... but these monsters are more organized than usual.~ /*At any rate, since Luskan is wrapped up in its own concerns, the countryside has become open season for banditry... these monsters, however, are more organized than is normal.*/
@74 = ~NP: Hello again,<CHARNAME> . I assume you remember me? bard, Sherwin? It was pretty boring to stand around and wait until Aribeth got down to business... It would be better if I myself while looking for this cult, earning fame.~ [SHARWY55] /*It's been rather boring standing around waiting for Aribeth to get her act together... I'd rather be out looking for this cult, making a name for myself while I'm at it.*/
@75 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@76 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@77 = ~If you're so interested in fame, why are you standing around here?~
@78 = ~NP: Of course. Lord Nasher spent an entire army to find the cult. The search in Neverwinter is a huge operation. I and the rest of the mercenaries were sent to these parts in search, which suits me completely. A small team is more likely to get glory.~ /*I and these other mercenaries have been sent out to these parts to search, which is fine by me. More chances for fame in a smaller group.*/
@79 = ~NP: Well, maybe I just love boredom... or maybe I was ordered to help you and Aribet, and there were no other instructions yet... Well, how? Make a healthy move, take me with you<CHARNAME> ? It's much more interesting than just hanging around here.~ /*Well, it could be that I enjoy being bored... or it could be that my instructions are to aid you and Aribeth, and I haven't been told to do anything, yet.*/
@80 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra hand. You're in.~
@81 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@82 = ~NP: Great. Then I am at your disposal. I will follow you as long as you need me<CHARNAME> .~ /*"My magic is at your disposal. What spell would you like me to cast?"*/
@83 = ~Well, well, well... you must be <CHARNAME>, correct? The legendary savior of Neverwinter? I've heard a couple of ballads written about you, already.~ [SHARWY54]
@84 = ~Well, I wasn't acting alone.~
@85 = ~Yes, that would be me.~
@86 = ~Is that so? Modesty is the last thing I would expect to find in the great <CHARNAME>.~
@87 = ~Ballads so rarely tell the truth, however. I should know. Ha ha! My name is Sharwyn, <CHARNAME>, a bard and master of skills... I suspect we have been hired for the same purpose. To find these cultists and stamp them out, yes?~
