@0 = ~Have you come to help us? We need all the help we can get. Luskan's got us outnumbered ten to one at least. But I'm just an ordinary soldier. You need to speak to Trancar, the battalion commander.~ 
@1 = ~If it wasn't for the catapults smashing our formations, we'd have stood against the Luskan scum! But how can you fight when it's raining boulders and flaming pitch all around you? That's why Trancar had the battalion pull back.~ 
@2 = ~Those war golems are unstoppable, I tell ya! Even Trancar knew better than to fight those monstrosities! That's why he had the battalion pull back to here.~ 
@3 = ~With the golems stopped and the catapults broken, we've got a fighting chance against those Luskan dogs! I hope Trancar sends me out on patrol soon! The enemy won't know what hit 'em!~
