@0 = ~New blood? Good! Remember, you fight one round at a time and get a medal for each victory. It's for glory alone. There's no prize. Oh course, if you beat all three rounds, you get to fight me. Then maybe you win the whole damn bar! Trust me, that will never happen.~ [NWCLAUD5] 
@1 = ~You beat Hrusk, eh? Not surprising. He's been here weeks and hasn't got out of round one. He's ruled it, but he hasn't gotten past it. He'd never beat me, but then, no one can. That's why I put the bar up as a reward. People stopped trying.~ [NWCLAUD4] 
@2 = ~You... beat Fashi, hmm? I suppose you think you are tough?! Well, don't get cocky. Agar will put you in your place. And if he doesn't, I will. Nobody beats me. If you think you'll walk out of here with MY bar, you are mistaken!~ [NWCLAUD3] 
@3 = ~That's it for you! You got past Agar, but it stops here. No one beats Claudus. Just ask! No one beats me! This place is mine!~ [NWCLAUD2]
@4 = ~Damn you! Damn you all! Fine! You won! So what! Proves nothing! I was Champion for months! Everyone knows that! Everyone knows...~ [NWCLAUD0]
@5 = ~Take the place. Go on, you are the owner now, but I've told my friends to leave. The Gauntlet goes with me! BAH!~
