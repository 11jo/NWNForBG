@0 = ~Why have you seized this Word of Power? **hiss** Who do you serve?~ [HAERD089]
@1 = ~I am <CHARNAME>. I serve the Lords' Alliance and the city of Neverwinter!~
@2 = ~MT: Я из команды <CHARNAME>. Я служу Союзу Лордов и городу Невервинтер!~ /*I am <CHARNAME>. I serve the Lords' Alliance and the city of Neverwinter!*/
@3 = ~Who are you?~
@4 = ~Die, lizardwoman scum!~
@5 = ~I will not answer your questions!~
@6 = ~These names mean nothing to me. **hiss** Your cities are young, your history but a single page in the accounts of the world.~ [HAERD090]
@7 = ~First you must answer me!~ [HAERD097]
@8 = ~**hiss** You cannot slay a projection, <PRO_RACE> fool!!~ [HAERD098]
@9 = ~My magic has sealed the door, the Word of Power shall not leave until you have answered my questions. **hiss** Who do you serve!~ [HAERD099]
@10 = ~MT: Среди всех вашшших имен есссть только одно, которое значит что-то для меня - Маугрим. **шшш** Ссскажи мне <RACE> - ты служишь Маугриму?~ [HAERD091] /*There is only one name that mattersss to me among your kind - Maugrim. **hiss** Tell me <PRO_RACE> one - do you serve Maugrim?*/
@11 = ~Maugrim is the enemy of Neverwinter!~
@12 = ~Uh... yes. I serve Maugrim. Do you have a message for him?~
@13 = ~I shall not rest until Maugrim is dead!~
@14 = ~I see you speak the truth, <PRO_RACE> one. This is good.~ [HAERD092]
@15 = ~Your lies are known to me, <PRO_RACE> one! **hiss** I sense that you seek Maugrim's defeat! This is good.~ [HAERD093]
@16 = ~Your enemies are mine as well. Maugrim must be stopped. He must not get the Words of Power!~ [HAERD094]
@17 = ~I have answered your questions. Now tell me who you are!~
@18 = ~Tell me something I don't know.~
@19 = ~My name is Haedraline, leader of the Word Slaves. **hiss** This is but a projection of my true form - I am yet too far to aid you in this task.~ [HAERD095]
@20 = ~There is more I would tell you, but my spell is fading. **hiss** Find the Words before Maugrim, or the world you know will not survive.~ [HAERD096]
@21 = ~You have done well, to find the second Word. **hiss** Its power draws my spell so that my projection may speak to you in this vision. There is much you must know.~ [HAERD051]
@22 = ~What do you have to tell me?~
@23 = ~I don't have time for this!~
@24 = ~**hiss** Maugrim is nothing but a fool. He does not truly understand what he seeeks. The Words are ancient beyond imagination, they contain power he cannot fathom.~ [HAERD052]
@25 = ~I am Haedraline, leader of the Word Slaves. **hiss** Your enemy is also mine - I must warn you of Maugrim and his followers.~ [HAERD072]
@26 = ~Time? What is time? A second, a day, a year, a thousand years - how long have I waited and watched and guarded while the Old Ones sleep. **hiss** You will listen - or my spell shall not release the door!~ [HAERD073]
@27 = ~I, Haedraline of the Word Slaves, was there at the beginning when the world was hot and this land was jungle where the Old Ones ruled.~ [HAERD053]
@28 = ~Word Slaves?~
@29 = ~Old Ones?~
@30 = ~When the world was hot? What are you talking about?~
@31 = ~What does this have to do with me?~
@32 = ~The living power of the Words Maugrim seeks had to be bound in the flesh of the Word Slaves. **hiss** We were unwilling guardians, our souls tied to the ancient magic of the Old Ones.~ [HAERD054]
@33 = ~The Old Ones are my people, an ancient race of lizard folk who ruled the North before the dawn of time. We were old when even the elves were young, we were the first, we were the Creator Race.~ [HAERD056]
@34 = ~Once this winter land was a lush jungle. Vents from the earth blasted scorching steam into the sky and the world was warm and fruitful. The Old Ones lived in this paradise, as did we Word Slaves.~ [HAERD058]
@35 = ~What happened to this tropical paradise?~
@36 = ~The humans and elves and dwarves were but slaves to my people, the Creator Race. Just as I was a slave bound with the power of the Words, **hiss** until the extinction of my people and the coming of the endless winter.~ [HAERD058]
@37 = ~Can you tell me about the extinction of the Old Ones?~
@38 = ~If your people were wiped out, how did you survive?~
@39 = ~What happened to the Words of Power when the Old Ones died?~
@40 = ~There better be a point to all this.~
@41 = ~When the world was hot we Word Slaves suffered for the empire of the Old Ones, **hiss** the Words ripping their power from our tortured spirits and our living flesh.~ [HAERD055]
@42 = ~But we were also a race of unbridled cruelty. **hiss** The strong ruled and the weak suffered - and we Word Slaves suffered most of all. Such was the way when the world was young and hot.~ [HAERD057]
@43 = ~The world grew cold, the jungles died. Frost and snow covered the land. For all their power, the Masters could not stop the change. **hiss** They vanished from the world, consumed by the earth that had turned against them.~ [HAERD060]
@44 = ~When the Old Ones vanished, the power of their Words remained. As did we, the Word Slaves bound to that power, forced to walk the now frozen and desolate earth. Forced to preserve the Words and legacy of our Masters.~ [HAERD061]
@45 = ~Over the centuries the magic of the Words became dormant, their power faded. And as we who were left behind grew strong the bonds enslaving us were broken.~ [HAERD070]
@46 = ~Maugrim seeks to unlock the dormant power of the Words so that he may enslave again. Word Slaves, humans, dwarves, elves - Maugrim would have all bow to him as Master.~ [HAERD063]
@47 = ~Maugrim will never succeed! I will stop him!~
@48 = ~MT: Спасибо, Хэдралин. Без твоей истории я бы не смог понять, что Маугрим хочет завоевать власть над миром.~ /*Wow, thanks Haedraline. I would have never figured Maugrim was seeking world domination without that little history of your people.*/
@49 = ~**hiss** Many Word Slaves died when the endless winter came. But some learned to survive in the frozen waste; hiding from the lesser races who now hunted us. To survive what the Masters could not endure.~ [HAERD062]
@50 = ~Tell me about the coming of this endless winter.~
@51 = ~What does this have to do with Maugrim?~
@52 = ~We who had once been Slaves scattered and hid the Words so that we would be forever free of their legacy. **hiss** Now thousands of years have passed and even we who hid the Words no longer know where to find them.~ [HAERD071]
@53 = ~Maugrim is already doomed. **hiss** The Words were meant to release ancient evil upon the land to devastate those who survived the change the Old Ones could not.~ [HAERD064]
@54 = ~MT: Избавь меня от своего сарказма <RACE>! **шшш** Ты ничем не лучшшшше Маугрима!~ [HAERD069] /*Spare me your sarcasm, <PRO_RACE> one! **hiss** You are as big a fool as Maugrim!*/
@55 = ~The plague was only the first of the evils the Words will unleash. **hiss** The world as you know it shall be no more if Maugrim succeeds! This is the legacy of the Creators.~ [HAERD065]
@56 = ~The Words will... UNH!!! No - it cannot be! UNH - Morag!~ [HAERD066]
@57 = ~What? What's wrong?~
@58 = ~Morag?~
@59 = ~Morag - she strikes at me! This cannot be - UNH! She attacks me through the Words - UNH! She disrupts my spell of projection - UNH!~ [HAERD067]
@60 = ~Wait, you were going to say something more about the Words!~
@61 = ~Morag? Who's Morag? Tell me before it's too late!~
@62 = ~MT: Хорошо. Теперь, когда действие заклинания кончилось, мне удастся выйти из этой дурацкой комнаты!~ /*Good. With your spell gone maybe I can leave this stupid room!*/
@63 = ~Noooooo!!!!~ [HAERD068]
@64 = ~The third Word is yours - but time is short and Morag stirs. **hiss** The city you call Neverwinter is under siege. Soon it will fall to Maugrim and he will possess the Source Stone.~ [HAERD074]
@65 = ~Source Stone? What's the Source Stone?~
@66 = ~Morag... You mentioned her once before.~
@67 = ~Die, lizard scum!~
@68 = ~Morag was the Queen of my people - the Old Ones, the Creator Race. **hiss** It was she who created the Source Stone when the world became cold and the snow covered the land.~ [HAERD075]
@69 = ~I am Haedraline, Word Slave and handmaiden to Morag before she was entombed in the Source Stone. **hiss** My spell seals the door - you must speak to me or you shall not leave.~ [HAERD087]
@70 = ~You cannot slay me - this is but a projection of my true form!~ [HAERD088]
@71 = ~Morag used the Words to put her people into a deep hibernation when the cold winter came, imprisoning the heat of the steam fissures in the magical Source Stone - and her and all her people with it.~ [HAERD076]
@72 = ~Why would she imprison herself inside this Source Stone?~
@73 = ~The Old Ones could not survive the coming of the winter storm. **hiss** Morag sought a shelter where she could escape the death of ice and cold.~ [HAERD077]
@74 = ~Within the Source Stone Morag would gather her strength year after year, century after century. **hiss** When her power waxed full, we Word Slaves would awaken the Queen to banish the never ending winter.~ [HAERD078]
@75 = ~MT: Если Мораг проснется, она превратит Север в тропические джунгли?~ /*So you think if Morag awakes she'll turn the North into a tropical jungle?*/
@76 = ~Morag was foolish to trust her fate to a group of slaves.~
@77 = ~How did Maugrim become involved in all this?~
@78 = ~The Source Stone is buried beneath the streets of Neverwinter, and even in its dormant state the magical heat radiating from within keeps the city habitable during the coldest blizzards.~ [HAERD079]
@79 = ~You do not comprehend the magic that once bound the Word Slaves to the Words! **hiss** We were compelled to obey, even though our Masters slept. But Morag underestimated us.~ [HAERD081]
@80 = ~Something has awakened Morag's spirit - though her body and true power remain trapped in the Source Stone for now. She speaks to Maugrim through projections as I am speaking to you.~ [HAERD083]
@81 = ~Imagine what will happen when the power is awakened fully and released. Those who survive the global warming will become slaves to the Creators, and I will be bound to the Words of Power once more. **hiss** I will not allow this to happen!~ [HAERD080]
@82 = ~Abandoned in the frozen waste, we grew strong enough to free ourselves from our wretched servitude. **hiss** We scattered the Words that their power might never enslave us again, and our Masters might never awake.~ [HAERD082]
@83 = ~Maugrim serves her, a pawn blinded by her promises of rewards and power. **hiss** The plague was the first step in Morag's return. Each death fed the Queen's power, bringing her closer to a true awakening.~ [HAERD084]
@84 = ~Now Maugrim seeks to claim the Words of Power the Lords' Alliance has hidden in Castle Never to complete the awakening. If he succeeds Morag will bring complete and utter devastation to the North.~ [HAERD085]
@85 = ~Somehow I will stop Maugrim!~
@86 = ~Complete and utter devastation. Sounds serious.~
@87 = ~**hiss** You must return to Neverwinter before the city falls. Speak to the one you call Aarin Gend - - I will try to meet you there.~ [HAERD086]
