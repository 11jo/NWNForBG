@0 = ~I ain't doing nothing, friend. Just sitting on the corner...~
@1 = ~Know why thieves are so thick in this area?~
@2 = ~What's your name?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Don't know anything about anything... just standing on a corner. You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.~ 
@5 = ~Don't have one. Nope. Just some nameless guy on the corner. Nothing to get concerned about... You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.~ 
@6 = ~You should, ah, be careful with that gear of yours... looks expensive... worth a bit... yeah.~
@7 = ~What? I ain't following nobody... just... uh... strolling. Yeah, that's it.~
@8 = ~I've already warned you about following me.~
@9 = ~You'll stroll into a grave! Why are you following people!~
@10 = ~Do I look like a fool? I could see you casing me.~
@11 = ~What? I never... I mean... aw, I'm sorry. I just gotta get some gold together... I wasn't going to do anything to you.~
@12 = ~What do you need gold for?~
@13 = ~This for the auction at Seedy Tavern?~
@14 = ~You just stroll somewhere else.~
@15 = ~I wasn't... I didn't mean... Blast it! I'll never make the gold at this rate! Look, I don't want any trouble. I was just looking for an easy mark. Obviously that ain't you, so I'll just be going.~ 
@16 = ~I don't know, I just heard that a plague cure was coming up for auction in the Seedy Tavern. Just let me get back to work... I'll never be able to afford it at this rate. Could steal the whole district and not have enough, I bet.~ 
@17 = ~What can you tell me about the auction?~
@18 = ~I don't like stalkers. You'd better start running.~
@19 = ~You know about that? Nobody's supposed to know. Everybody does though. Like it was leaked out or something. I don't know, I just heard that a plague cure was coming up for auction in the Seedy Tavern. Just let me get back to work... I'll never be able to afford it at this rate. Could steal the whole district and not have enough, I bet.~ 
@20 = ~Oh, no problem. Don't you worry. I'll just be on my way then. Yes, on my way... Nice stuff you got there...~
@21 = ~Who, me? I don't know much about it. It's at the Seedy Tavern. It's funded by Bloodsailors... that means Vengaul is involved somehow.~
@22 = ~What do you know about the Seedy Tavern?~
@23 = ~Tell me about Vengaul and the Bloodsailors.~
@24 = ~Nothing anyone else couldn't tell you. It's in the north central of the district, and it's where the black market usually is. A guy like me can't even get in there. They've got a brick wall of a bouncer that won't let anyone in that isn't a Bloodsailor. Them uniforms is hard to come by. Of course, maybe if I got enough gold together, she might say different. I don't know.~ 
@25 = ~Well, anyone that stays around here for long hears about Vengaul Bloodsail. He's flashy, and he likes showing off. The bloodsailors are his... pirates, mostly.~
@26 = ~Mostly? What do you mean by that?~
@27 = ~Well, it's a big group. One guy can't run the whole thing. Vengaul, he's a showman, but he needs some organizers too. I hear that his first lieutenant is hot under the collar right now. Callik's his name... but I ain't saying anything else... I don't know anything else.~
