@0 = ~Yelp! Rrr, you have bested me. What do you want? Rowf! I show my throat to you. Sink your teeth into it, it is yours...~ [WOLFF02] /*Rowf! I show my throat to you. Sink your teeth into it, it is yours...*/
@1 = ~You talk do you? Then answer my questions!~
@2 = ~Grovelling won't save your worthless hide! Die, dog!~
@3 = ~As you wish, manling...~
@4 = ~Where did you learn to talk?~
@5 = ~You've been hunting the nearby cattle, haven't you...~
@6 = ~Whimpering dog! I've decided to kill you after all.~
@7 = ~Grrrrr! I am no tame and addled pet! I would rather die than face your foolish insults!~
@8 = ~My mother served a manling ranger. He taught me your foolish tongue when I was still a pup.~
@9 = ~Who is this ranger?~
@10 = ~Tell me about your hunting grounds.~
@11 = ~There is more meat on them than a deer and they do not run as fast... Would you not hunt them?~
@12 = ~It sounds like coward's food...~
@13 = ~Yes but they're owned by farmers who will have you killed!~
@14 = ~Nobody. He is dead. He sent my mother to fight a demon just so he could run away. I killed him with my own teeth. It is bad enough to serve a manling. Rrrrrr, but it is worse to serve a coward...~ /*Nobody. He is dead. He sent my mother to fight a demon just so he could run away. I killed him with my own teeth.*/
@15 = ~That I face you here should be proof that I'm no coward...~
@16 = ~Fine. I want to ask you something else.~
@17 = ~We used to hunt in the east woods but there is something evil there. My mate preyed on a manling village but the meat was rancid on the bone. When he ate it, he said it took a piece of him away with it to an endless place. And then it took more and more until he died from the inside out.~ /*When he ate it, he said it took a piece of him away with it to an endless place. And then it took more and more until he died from the inside out.*/
@18 = ~That is why I've led the pack out of the forest and to this new den... And now you come here and defile it! Grrrr...~
@19 = ~Who is this ranger who taught you to speak?~
@20 = ~Grrrrrr... I am no coward. It is you manlings that show cowardice, wearing the skins of others, relying on more than fang and claw to fight...~
@21 = ~Grrrr.... I'll make my hunting grounds where I wish! And as for manlings owning the animals, it reminds me of the ranger who taught me your foolish tongue!~
@22 = ~I will not follow you, manling, if that is what you have come to ask...~
@23 = ~Simply a favor, that's all I ask...~
@24 = ~Your courage has earned you that much. I will not follow you but you may ask something else of me...~
@25 = ~I need you to stop hunting the cattle... and no people, either!~
@26 = ~Grrrrr! I am no tame and addled pet! I would rather die than follow another manling!~
@27 = ~Rrrrr... Their flesh is the best I've tasted in many years but I will do as you ask. There are enough deer about for us to live on...~
@28 = ~Rrrrrrrrr... Get out of my lair.~ [WOLFF02]
@29 = ~Well, I'm leaving now.~
