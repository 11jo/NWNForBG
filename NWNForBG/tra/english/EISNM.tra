@0 = ~I'm warning you - If you be lookin' for our boy Urth, he ain't here.~
@1 = ~Get out of here, you dirty scoundrel.~
@2 = ~NP: You have done us three a great favor, <SIRMAAM>, and I would like to share some of my family's possessions with you. Here's a chest with 500 gold pieces in it. It was my inheritance, but I've never gotten up the nerve to spend it. So whether I get rid of it now or later, it doesn't matter.~ /*A chest of 300 gold. 'Twas my inheritance but I've been too scared to spend it. Now's as good a time to be rid of it as any.*/
@3 = ~That's more than enough. May the gods bless you.~
@4 = ~Actually, I could use another 100 gold.~
@5 = ~Nice try. Give me everything you've got or your precious boy gets it.~
@6 = ~May the winds be ever at your back, my friend.~
@7 = ~Of course, good <CHARNAME>. It's not easy being an adventurer, as Urth learned almost too late.~
@8 = ~Of what use are your deeds if we all starve over the winter? I'm sorry, that's too much for me to give.~
@9 = ~NP: Okay, actually 500 gold pieces is quite enough.~ /*I suppose two thousand gold will have to do.*/
@10 = ~NP: Ugh, goddamn it! We'll starve to death in the winter, but take your demon gold.~ /*Why, may the weather rot you, <CHARNAME>! We'll starve the winter, rest assured, but here be your devil's gold.*/
@11 = ~Aye, this has become a happy home again.~
@12 = ~You heard the missus. Now move on.~
@13 = ~They're rickety an' - an' it's a danger to climb them, you hear?~
