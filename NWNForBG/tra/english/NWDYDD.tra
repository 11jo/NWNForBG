@0 = ~Hmm? Good day, dear <PRO_SIRMAAM>. You look like you're here for the competition, same as me.~
@1 = ~And who might you be?~
@2 = ~What competition? What are you talking about?~
@3 = ~Oh yeah, I know all about the competition.~
@4 = ~No, I'm not here for any competition.~
@5 = ~NP: I'm here to win the match.~ /*Yes. Me is here to *win* competition.*/
@6 = ~I will leave.~
@7 = ~The name's Dydd. My vast intelligence will see me through the competition, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>... and then everyone will know of me.~
@8 = ~Oh. You don't know? Well, I'm not going to be the one to tell you, then. Mutamin likes to keep it a secret. Oops!~
@9 = ~Oh, I know about *that.* I was just hoping for pointers.~
@10 = ~So this is Mutamin's secret? I'll ask *him!*~
@11 = ~Truly enough. But when I heard about Mutamin's secret dungeon crawl and the great reward, I just knew my great intelligence would let me win.~
@12 = ~And have you won yet?~
@13 = ~Ha! I just tricked you! I didn't know!~
@14 = ~Hmph. I can see through your simple bluff easily. I am far too intelligent to be taken in by mere chicanery, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>.~
@15 = ~How about 100 gold to loosen your tongue?~
@16 = ~I see. Well, those of limited intelligence should really stand aside for those of us more gifted. (sniff) I plan on collecting the reward soon enough.~
@17 = ~Ah. Well, I hope for your sake that you're more intelligent than you seem, my dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. It *is* brains that will bring victory, you know.~
@18 = ~As you wish.~
@19 = ~Certainly not. I plan on entering and winning the competition, not on earning Mutamin's wrath. Good day to you, <PRO_SIRMAAM>.~
@20 = ~Hey! I'm too busy preparing my strategies. I don't need you distracting me. Go bother someone else.~
@21 = ~Well... I suspect I'll head on in soon enough. I *am* planning a brilliant strategy to make it past all the obstacles and traps, after all. And I'm *not* sharing any of them with you. Mutamin's reward is too high to share, so good day to you.~ /*Well... I suspect I'll head on in soon enough. I *am* planning a brilliant strategy to make it past all the obstacles and traps, after all.*/
@22 = ~I trust I'll be seeing you again soon enough, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Until then, please let me strategize.~
@23 = ~NP: It's useless to compete with me<MALEFEMALE> . My brilliant intellect can easily deal with you.~ /*It is pointless for you to compete against me, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. My superior intelligence will prevail in the end.*/
