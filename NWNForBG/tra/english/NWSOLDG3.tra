@0 = ~You the replacements? Good for you. Do what you want. I've told my men to hold position.~
@1 = ~What have you seen?~
@2 = ~Are you ignoring your duty as a guard?~
@3 = ~Are the undead related to the plague?~
@4 = ~What do you think we've seen? Dead everywhere. If I wanted to face undead I'd have been an idiot adventurer. Never liked working near the Great Graveyard. Guess the plague just filled it too damn full.~ /*What do you think we've seen? Dead everywhere. If I wanted to face undead I'd have been an idiot adventurer.*/
@5 = ~Where is that? Is that where the undead come from?~
@6 = ~Goodbye.~
@7 = ~What do you know of it? You're no veteran. You've just arrived. This kind of fight is not our job. My men keep order, they don't fight abominations. This is bad magic, and I don't have the means to fight it.~ /*My men keep order, they don't fight abominations. This is bad magic, and I don't have the means to fight it.*/
@8 = ~How the hell would I know? What do I know about undead? Or plague? This is not my problem. What I know is that undead attack relentlessly. Whoever is behind this wants us dead. Period. I won't walk into it like a fool.~ /*What I know is that undead attack relentlessly. Whoever is behind this wants us dead. Period. I won't walk into it like a fool.*/
@9 = ~The Great Graveyard is north of the Beggar's Nest. Go if you want. I don't want to know anything about it.~
@10 = ~NP: Go wherever you want. My men will hold this position. At least it's safe here.~ /*Go where you want. My men will hold the wall. At least it's safe up here.*/
@11 = ~What is it? I'm getting tired of explaining myself. My men are not risking themselves down there and that's final.~
@12 = ~I see there are not as many undead around, but we ain't taking any chances. We're staying here.~
