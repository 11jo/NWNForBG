@0 = ~Yes? What brings you here?~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I'll answer a question or two... provided you don't take too long.~
@4 = ~I'm curious about some recent events...~
@5 = ~Anything interesting going on in these parts?~
@6 = ~Can I ask you some directions?~
@7 = ~Yes, yes. My <DAYNIGHTALL> chores are beckoning.~
@8 = ~You're not here regarding Pete and the wolves, are you?~
@9 = ~Yes, the wolves. What can you tell me about them?~
@10 = ~Actually I'm hunting down a cult...~
@11 = ~How many of you live here?~
@12 = ~I want to ask you something else.~
@13 = ~Other than Peter and the wolves, there's not much to say, really. What might you have in mind?~
@14 = ~Tell me about the wolves, then.~
@15 = ~I'd be interested in work, if you know of anything.~
@16 = ~Are there any other places you think I should stop by, here?~
@17 = ~Very well but don't keep me too long from my <DAYNIGHTALL> chores.~
@18 = ~Where does the north road lead?~
@19 = ~Where does the east road lead?~
@20 = ~Is there a place to buy equipment nearby?~
@21 = ~They moved in a few weeks ago and have been a terror ever since. My husband, Pete, he's too busy fretting about the cattle to sleep!~
@22 = ~Cattle cost money. How bad are the finances?~
@23 = ~Maybe I can help. Know anything else about it?~
@24 = ~There are no more problems with wolves, they will no longer bother you.~
@25 = ~A cult? Goodness me, what would you expect an old farmwife to know of that? We're good hard-working folk out here. No foolish cult would get far with us! Do you have more questions?~ /*A cult? Goodness me, what would you expect an old farmwife to know of that? We're good hard-working folk out here. No foolish cult would get far with us!*/
@26 = ~What did you say about wolves?~
@27 = ~Oh it's a small house sure enough, but it's home. Pete built it before we married and our darling Constance grew up in it and is with us still.~
@28 = ~How is Constance?~
@29 = ~What do you want to know?~
@30 = ~Pete says the big one, the she-wolf... her name is Silverback. He says he knows this 'cause... Oh I shouldn't say, you'll think him daft!~
@31 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@32 = ~A helpful hand is aways appreciated around here. You should talk to Pete. No doubt he's out there protecting the herd.~
@33 = ~Tell me about the wolves.~
@34 = ~Maybe by Ingo's place. His wife and I were so close before her passing. Something of him died with her, though. He's lost his spark. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*Maybe by Ingo's place. His wife and I were so close before her passing. Something of him died with her, though. He's lost his spark.*/
@35 = ~West? That's the road we take to Port Llast on market days. It's a long trip, though, and we usually spend the night with Pete's cousins in town.~
@36 = ~Ooh, the east road leads past Ingo's fields and into the Charwood. Just ask Ingo, it's not a place meant for the living to tread...~
@37 = ~We're all farmers here, not merchants or tradesfolk. Nearest shop's probably all the way back to Port Llast.~
@38 = ~It does not matter. For the most part we're self-sufficient out here but there are some things that can only be had in town... We still have enough of a herd to scrape by but imagine if the wolves had taken them all! We'd be left with nothing!~
@39 = ~You'd best talk to my husband Pete. He's probably out watching the herd as we speak.~
@40 = ~Oh, thank you kind <RACE>, and my husband has been exhausted guarding the herd. Now our life will be back to normal. Is there anything else you'd like to ask?~
@41 = ~Not wise enough to be a woman yet... but she'll get there. She means well enough. I was a young spitfire in my day too, you know... Was there anything else you wanted to know?~
@42 = ~Well he says he's heard her talking on the wind, telling stories to her cubs. A wolf who speaks Common... Pete's always had an imagination! If you ask me, he's just so caught up in protecting the herd that he's made the she-wolf into something more than she is. Is there something else you wanted to know?~ /*Pete's always had an imagination! If you ask me, he's just so caught up in protecting the herd that he's made the she-wolf into something more than she is.*/
@43 = ~You again, is it?~
@44 = ~Yes, I still have questions...~
@45 = ~Well, now, I don't have all day to be interrupted. There's bread in the oven, you know.~
@46 = ~Why fancy having a good <LADYLORD> like you in my own house! Is there something you want to ask?~
@47 = ~I'd be happy to answer a question or two. What do you want to know?~
