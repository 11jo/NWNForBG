@0 = ~Welcome to the Cracked Anvil. I'm Haljal Throndor, and I reckon you're here to dither and bargain me right out of business, aren't ye, stranger?~
@1 = ~What can I purchase here?~
@2 = ~Let me see what I can buy.~
@3 = ~I have some questions about the surrounding region.~
@4 = ~I've got what I need. See you around, Haljal.~
@5 = ~Well, our selection of goods run the gamut, being as that we're the general store for the good town of Port Llast. Why don't you take a look yourself?~ 
@6 = ~No problem, old man. No problem at all. Here, choose.~
@7 = ~Be stopping back again, good <LADYLORD>. Your business is always welcome~ 
@8 = ~Sometimes I hear stories about an area, sometimes I don't. Though when I do, it's usually about a place like the Neverwinter Wood, Charwood, or even Luskan sometimes.~
@9 = ~Have you heard any news from Charwood?~
@10 = ~Have you heard any news from the Neverwinter Wood?~
@11 = ~Have you heard any news from Luskan?~
@12 = ~Another time, perhaps.~
@13 = ~Aye, the place has always been strange but some adventurers came through recently with a tale that was stranger yet. Apparently the townsfolk have been but phantoms for some time now, all reliving some past horror. From the sounds of it, all those souls have been put to rest now, one way or another.~ 
@14 = ~Thanks, I'll go.~ 
@15 = ~To be true, there hasn't been much coming from Charwood in quite some time. Perhaps it's for the better, too. I hear tell it's a spooky place.~
@16 = ~An adventuring group stopped by to re-equip and mentioned that someone had poisoned the Spirit of the Wood out that way. They didn't say how the trouble got resolved, just that it's all been dealt with one way or another.~ 
@17 = ~Not a peep coming out of them woods, so far as I were to say, though I haven't spoken with many who'd been through there.~
@18 = ~Know someone who might have gone there recently?~
@19 = ~Actually, Ballard goes out that way now and then. You might want to talk to him. He's hanging around in a grove to the northeast of Port Llast. You have to go beyond the walls of the city to get into the grove.~ 
@20 = ~Well, I heard word from a merchant friend about... well, what am I saying? I wouldn't want to get my friend in trouble, repeating tales meant for my ears alone.~
@21 = ~Can't you just tell me without mentioning names?~
@22 = ~Ah. Well... I guess so. I guess I can tell ye. Ye be a trustworthy sort, right? Aye. Word is that there were a great conflict betwixt the High Captains therein, and much disruption to the trade routes. A brave hero like yourself might be finding a way to exploit that situation to his own benefit, and resolve the problems therein at the time.~ 
@23 = ~I'm sorry, but my friend is one I cannot risk hurting. Not for a situation such as this would be, at any rate.~
