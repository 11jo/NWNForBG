@0 = ~Why, hullo there! You have the smell of a prospective employer about you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Not that it's easy to smell anything with all the burning corpses in this city, mind you. Never seen this many flies outside of a Calimshite alehouse.~ [NWTOM051]
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~That's a horrible thing to say!~
@3 = ~Aren't you frightened of the plague?~
@4 = ~NP: I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.~ /*I don't feel like talking right now. Goodbye.*/
@5 = ~NP: Ð¯? Well, I'm none other than the illustrious rogue, Tomi the Hangman! 'Merrymaker' to friends, 'Tomi Merrymaker' to girls, and 'that bloody halfling' to any member of the esteemed authorities. However, the fact that you don't know me is quite forgivable. I was last born in Calimport... and that's a long way even for my reputation. Personally, I'd give it another week.~ /*Me? Why, I'm none other than the renowned rogue, Tomi Undergallows! "Grin" to my friends, "Tomi Grin" to the lasses, and "that damned halfling" to anyone in a position of respectable authority.*/
@6 = ~What do you do around here?~
@7 = ~Do you always talk this much?~
@8 = ~Running from your reputation, are you?~
@9 = ~That's quite a long way to travel.~
@10 = ~Oh, I don't think the Calimshites would mind, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. The way they dress, it be a kindness to talk instead about their foul ale.~
@11 = ~What does that mean?~
@12 = ~Oh, to be honest, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>, I be far more frightened to take a swig of Calimshite ale. You'd be lucky to wake up three days later hugging the back end of a camel, I'd wager.~
@13 = ~Oops! I hear that's the first sign of the plague. Tsk. If you don't die some wretched death, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>, come back sometime and we'll make a deal, aye?~
@14 = ~NP: Well, I could ask you that, couldn't I? Well, uh. to be honest, when I came in here the day before yesterday, I was being chased by a bunch of scumbags. Well, it's as good a place as any... especially since no one throws half-breeds out the door like they do in Calimport. so I've been hanging around, thinking maybe I could find some work.~ /*It seems like as good a place as any... 'specially considering the priests don't throw halflings out on their ears as a policy, like in Calimport... so I've been hanging about looking for something to do.*/
@15 = ~Unless you're sneaking up for a good backstab or in the sack with a pretty miss, I really don't see the need for restraint. Silence is for the dead... although I hear they can be a bit chatty, too, at times.~
@16 = ~Well, you strike me as a bit of a rogue yourself, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Sometimes a reputation deserves to be run from, aye? Like a giant ogre with big feet and poor eyesight.~
@17 = ~Nothing too wrong with having a bit of a reputation, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Keeps the flies from settling, if you know what I mean. If the heat gets too high, you just step out of the kitchen, right?~
@18 = ~NP: Well, I'm sure you know how it is. If you rob some fat Caliph with fat lips, kiss his daughter for fun before you run away with the loot, you are the most dangerous criminal in Kalimshan. How could I have known he'd be so offended about his daughter? But I still think it was worth it. It takes style, and I've got style! I wish Neverwinter had treated me better at first.~ /*You know how it goes, I'm sure. Rob some over-fat human caliph with piggy lips, kiss his daughter as a lark before you escape with the loot, and suddenly you're the most wanted man in Calimshan.*/
@19 = ~He hunted you for kissing his daughter?~
@20 = ~What happened then?~
@21 = ~Heh... it means I be bloody glad to be out of Calimshan and anywhere else, even here! Now, about that employer business...~
@22 = ~Well, I use the word "kissing" loosely, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. Trouble was, the lass was set to marry the Pasha's son... so long as she was a virgin. Ah, well.~
@23 = ~NP: Neverwinter seemed like a generous enough city for an enterprising young halfling like me.... at first glance, anyway. You have no idea the kind of things you can get away with here. They can take a completely innocent man, accuse him of a simple pocket theft, and throw him in jail without bothering with little things like a trial. Or at least a fair trial. The judge was biased.~ /*They can take a perfectly innocent man, accuse him of simple pickpocketing, and throw him in prison without even so much as a trial. Or not a very fair one, anyway. That judge was mean.*/
@24 = ~Fortunately, my stay in Neverwinter's fine prison system was a short one. I didn't arrange for my escape, oddly enough, but I was glad for it nevertheless.~
@25 = ~So you're a convict, then?~
@26 = ~How did you escape the prison?~
@27 = ~I'm looking for a good rogue to help me in my mission.~
@28 = ~Technically, I suppose I am. Trust me, however: they have so many other things to worry about in that prison, even if they thought I wasn't dead they wouldn't trouble with me.~
@29 = ~Why do you say that? What trouble?~
@30 = ~I'm not about to deal with a convict!~
@31 = ~NP: I don't know what goes on in prison, <LADYLORD>. To tell you the truth, I had only been there a few days, and I had just begun to reflect on the hopelessness of existence when it all began. The warden suddenly started muttering nonsense and released all the prisoners. Even the worst monsters: murderers, politicians, lawyers, you name it.~ /*The exact goings-on within the prison I'm not entirely aware of, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. To tell the truth, I had only been in the prison for a few days and was just starting to think about how depressing life was when it all began.*/
@32 = ~Oh? A mission, is it? My little pinky toes are quivering with curiosity! Or is that my danger sense? Hmm... that would go a long way toward explaining my recklessness. Oh well. What kind of mission are you on?~
@33 = ~NP: I work for Lady Aribeth. I've been tasked with finding the missing creatures needed to obtain a cure for the plague.~ /*I work for Lady Aribeth. I have been instructed to find several missing creatures that might be used to find a plague cure.*/
@34 = ~I work for Lady Aribeth. My mission is confidential.~
@35 = ~Considering my profession, that's quite a fine line you draw there. Have it your way, however. If you change your mind, we'll chat again.~
@36 = ~I left the area quickly, of course, and wound up here at the temple... nice safe place t' be. Last I heard, them prisoners were all tearing up the Peninsula district, making a royal mess. Mmm, not the lawyers, though... they were just overcharging.~
@37 = ~Why would the warden release the prisoners?~
@38 = ~NP: Honestly, I don't know. Some of the guys were talking about how there was some powerful prisoner in there, and he kind of took control of the warden and made him do all this stuff.... sounds pretty weird to me. More like he was brainwashed by the plague than anything else. The whole peninsula, however, is in turmoil. And I seriously doubt the local police are in control of the situation.~ /*I really can't say. Some of the other fellows were talking like there was some powerful prisoner who was controlling the warden and making him do these things... sounds too strange to me.*/
@39 = ~NP: So, not just a task, but a legitimized heroic deed for the glory of the spicy elf. I'm listening to you, <LADYLORD>. I'd be happy to help. for a fair amount of money. Then let's bargain a little, shall we? I can put my excellent knowledge of thievery, lock picking and swordsmanship at your complete disposal, provided we agree on a good payment.~ /*So let's negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.*/
@40 = ~NP: Oh, so you're a secret agent in the service of a luscious elf chick? Must be a real turn-on. I'd be happy to help. for a fair amount of money. Then let's do a little haggling, shall we? I can put my excellent skills in thievery, lock picking and swordsmanship at your complete disposal, provided we agree on a good price.~ /*So let's negotiate a bit, shall we? I can place my superior skills of theft, lockpicking and swordplay at your disposal for any task you choose, providing you can provide me with a nice payment now.*/
@41 = ~Come to think of it, I saw more than a few people getting attacked in the street in broad daylight. If you head to that part of town, you might want to take someone along who knows the roads, aye?~
@42 = ~Actually, I'm looking for some hired help to assist me on my mission.~
@43 = ~No thanks. Goodbye.~
@44 = ~Aww, now that is a shame. Well, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>, don't let zombies eat your brains or anything. I hear it's bad for one's health.~
@45 = ~I rather doubt you'll find anyone else of my skill available, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>. 200 gold pieces seems like a fair bargain, don't you agree?~
@46 = ~NP: Here's your 800 gold pieces. Welcome to the family, Tomi.~ /*Here's your 200 gold. Welcome aboard, Sharwyn.*/
@47 = ~That seems a little expensive. I'll give you 100.~
@48 = ~I don't have that kind of gold to spend on a henchman.~
@49 = ~Goodbye.~
@50 = ~NP: All right, all right! I'm sensing an adventure is just around the corner! Or I'm gonna wash my socks, one of two things. I'll cater to you, <LADYLORD>, as I understand it... or whatever you say. If you want to give me any valuable advice, just whistle, eh?~ /*I'll tag along with you, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>, as best as I know how... unless you tell me otherwise. If you want me to do something different, just give me a shout, aye?*/
@51 = ~NP: I guess it's either that or I'm gonna have to pull that iron out of your ass. All right, that's a strong argument. Make it 600 gold pieces. I'll cater to you, <LADYLORD>, as I understand it... or whatever you say. If you want to give me any valuable advice, just whistle, okay?~ /*I guess it's either that or I spend the next week or two picking lint out of my bellybutton... All right, you've convinced me. 200 gold pieces it is.*/
@52 = ~Do I look like I just got off the last boat from the Moonshaes? I know how dangerous you adventurous types are. 200 or no love from Tomi!~
@53 = ~You were expecting me to work for free? What do I look like? An elf?! Pfffft! Come back when you find a few coins.~
@54 = ~Well, fine. Tomi Undergallows has better things to do. I'm sure someone will hire me any day now.~
@55 = ~So you've come back, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>! Looking for a short lad to tickle your feet? Or did ya change your mind about needing a rogue at your side?~ [NWTOM052]
@56 = ~NP: Are you still here?~ /*She still here?*/
@57 = ~I want to ask you some questions.~
@58 = ~NP: Well, I haven't been kicked out of here yet, so I guess I'm welcome here. Why? Do you have any other offers?~ /*Well, the priests haven't kicked me out, yet, so I figures I'm welcome. Why? You got someplace better for me to be?*/
@59 = ~NP: Questions, eh? Frankly, I'm not exactly an old-timer in Neverwinter. I've been trying to make some contacts with people here, but they've all died like flies. No offense, huh? I don't know much about the Peninsula area, though. It was a fleeting impression, considering the whistle I flew past - but what else would you expect from an escaped convict?~ /*Questions, eh? To be honest, I'm not that big on Neverwinter just yet. I was trying to make some contacts earlier, but they just kept *dying*. How annoying is that?*/
@60 = ~Well, now, if it isn't <CHARNAME>! Glad I am to see you! Isn't the country wonderful this time of year? So much better than the city with all that... umm... burning and dying. You know.~ [NWTOM053]
@61 = ~I'm surprised to see you here, Tomi.~
@62 = ~You again? Are you following me around?~
@63 = ~NP: Yeah, well, what do you want from a halfling? Where the money goes, I go. After our paths parted, Mamzelle Aribet came up to me and gave me a lot of money to sign up for this pleasure ride of hers. We should all help with the search. Looks like Lord Nasher wants to weed out all those sectarians who started the fight. Well done, I think! Living proof that not all old people should be killed for being useless, isn't he?~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@64 = ~So you were conscripted into service by Aribeth?~
@65 = ~NP: How much would it cost to hire you?~ /*How much would it cost to hire your services?*/
@66 = ~NP: Well, uh. maybe there is a little bit. After all, there aren't that many employers left alive for them to line up for me, right? Besides. you don't have much to chase after. Looks like Lord Nasher wants to wipe out all those sectarians who started the fight. Well done, I think! He's living proof that not all old people should be killed for being useless, isn't he?~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@67 = ~Uh-huh. Toodle-loo!~
@68 = ~NP: I've already been paid by that ma'am Aribet. and not bad, by the way, I'll tell you that. You'd think this guy Nasher would be shitting gold. All I was told was to help in any way I can. That's a nice, non-binding demand, isn't it? I, uh, I don't think you really want anything, do you?~ /*I was just told that I'm supposed to help out wherever I can. How sweet and unspecific is that? I, uh, don't suppose you actually want something, do you?*/
@69 = ~Do you have any information on the cult behind the Wailing Death?~
@70 = ~I could use a good rogue by my side.~
@71 = ~I don't need anything right now.~
@72 = ~Okey-dokey! If you find yourself in need of a rougue, I'm already bought and paid for... just need to know where the party is.~
@73 = ~Nothing more than anyone, no. You ask me, though, Luskan's the place to look.~
@74 = ~Luskan?~
@75 = ~Well, isn't it a coincidence that I happen to be a good rogue? Fine... this one-rabbit town was beginning to bore me, anyway.~
@76 = ~Besides a bath? Suit yourself, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>.~
@77 = ~NP: Yeah, well. This town's full of thieves and pirates. Anybody's welcome there, as long as it ain't white and fluffy, that's for sure. I've been there a couple times myself. Where better for a frog to hide than among the toads? Not that I have any proof or anything.~ /*Oh, aye. The city has pirates and thieves galore... anyone with any kind of bad reputation is more than welcome there, I assure you. Been there a few times, myself.*/
@78 = ~NP: Hey, <LADYLORD>! Can't live without Tomy the Hangman, huh? All that work for ma'amselle Aribet. this whole cult guy thing. has been a lot of fun so far. Nothing to do but stare at suspicious characters.~ [NWTOM055] /*This job of Miss Aribeth's... looking for them cult fellows... it's been pretty sweet so far. Haven't had to do much 'cept stare at people all suspicious-like.*/
@79 = ~So you're working for Aribeth?~
@80 = ~Have you heard any rumors about the cult since you've come here?~
@81 = ~Do you intend to just sit around here, then?~
@82 = ~NP: It looks like Lord Nasher wants to kill all those sectarians who started the quarrel. Well done, I think! A living proof that not all old people should be killed for being useless, right? Anyway, Mademoiselle Aribet has given me a lot of coin to join this quest. Well done, so far.~ /*Seems like Lord Nasher wants to get rid of all the cultists who started this fight. I say good for him! Just goes to show that not all old people are useless and should be killed, you know?*/
@83 = ~NP: Well, I don't think I could have done much on my own, <LADYLORD>. Hell, they just told me to get the hell outta here and wait until someone needed me. It's not like I'm a hero like you... although I'm a hell of a rogue, pardon the immodesty. This town's a bore. I've already counted 14 chickens crossing the road. I guess if you need me, I'll gladly go wherever you want me to go.~ /*This town is kind of boring. So far I've counted fourteen chickens that crossed the road. I suppose, if you needed me, I'd be happy to tag along with ya.*/
@84 = ~I wouldn't mind an extra body. You're in.~
@85 = ~Sorry, but I'm not interested. Goodbye.~
@86 = ~All righty, then, m'<PRO_LADYLORD>... I'm all yours. If ya need me to do something other than what I'm doing, just give me a shout.~
@87 = ~Hullo there! <CHARNAME>, isn't it? Wow... the savior of Neverwinter! Would you sign my napkin? It's a bit greasy... and mind the chicken...~ [NWTOM054]
@88 = ~Well, I wasn't acting alone.~
@89 = ~Yes, that would be me.~
@90 = ~Modesty, eh? How's that working out for ya? If I were you, I'd take advantage of the notoriety while you have it. Three months from now they'll turn you away from the door at McBarnaby's, saying "<CHARNAME> who?"~
@91 = ~Me, I'm Tomi Undergallows. Grin to my friends... Tomi Grin to my other friends. I've been hired by Miss Aribeth, there, to help find these nasty cultist-types.~
