StringRef: 3694, Sound: GARRK40, Text: The world is such a cruel place.
StringRef: 3695, Sound: GARRK41, Text: Nooo. Why her? She didn't deserve this!
StringRef: 3700, Sound: SAFAN05, Text: I really think this party needs new leadership.
StringRef: 3701, Sound: SAFAN06, Text: To lead this party, we need someone intelligent, preferably female, and most likely me.
StringRef: 3702, Sound: SAFAN07, Text: I've tried to guide this group in the right direction, but I'm tired of trying. Goodbye.
StringRef: 3703, Sound: SAFAN08, Text: This is probably the sanest decision this group has ever made.
StringRef: 3704, Sound: SAFAN09, Text: A woman needs her beauty rest.
StringRef: 3705, Sound: SAFAN10, Text: Perhaps we could do something a little more exciting than looking pretty.
StringRef: 3706, Sound: SAFAN11, Text: I'm hurt. S-stop what you're doing and help me now.
StringRef: 3707, Sound: SAFAN13, Text: The city is a beautiful place, so full of the gullible and stupid.
StringRef: 3715, Sound: SAFAN23, Text: Between two evils, I always choose the one I haven't tried.
StringRef: 3717, Sound: SAFAN24, Text: I love it when you speak to me that way.
StringRef: 3718, Sound: SAFAN25, Text: When I'm good, I'm very, very good... but when I'm bad, I'm better.
StringRef: 3719, Sound: SAFAN26, Text: Everyone in this party is entitled to my opinion.
StringRef: 3721, Sound: SAFAN27, Text: I assume, Coran, that you think your elven charms are considerable. Let me enlighten you: They aren't.
StringRef: 3723, Sound: SAFAN28, Text: You have about as much appeal as a rutting owlbear.
StringRef: 3724, Sound: SAFAN29, Text: You think I'd surrender myself to the likes of you? That's a laugh.
StringRef: 3726, Sound: SAFAN30, Text: Watch what you say, elf.
StringRef: 3727, Sound: SAFAN31, Text: I might find you attractive, Coran, if you weren't so irritating.
StringRef: 3728, Sound: SAFAN32, Text: I like it when you're nasty to me.
StringRef: 3729, Sound: SAFAN33, Text: You could be somewhat more creative in your insults.
StringRef: 3730, Sound: SAFAN34, Text: I always love a good compliment.
StringRef: 3731, Sound: SAFAN35, Text: You're a very sexy man.
StringRef: 3732, Sound: SAFAN36, Text: I'd love to see what other skills you possess.
StringRef: 3734, Sound: SAFAN37, Text: My feet are very sore—perhaps you could massage them.
StringRef: 3735, Sound: SAFAN40, Text: The rest of you should be careful lest you end up like our unfortunate friend.
StringRef: 3737, Sound: FALDN01, Text: I am Faldorn. I have been looking for those who would fight for the sanctity of this forest.
StringRef: 3738, Sound: FALDN02, Text: I will not waste my life here.
StringRef: 3739, Sound: FALDN04, Text: We have pleased Oak Father, I sense it.
StringRef: 3741, Sound: FALDN05, Text: Oak Father would frown on us now.
StringRef: 3742, Sound: FALDN06, Text: I cannot stand by people of such little character.
StringRef: 3743, Sound: FALDN07, Text: I will have nothing more to do with your lot.
StringRef: 3744, Sound: FALDN08, Text: I will do as best I can as your leader.
StringRef: 3745, Sound: FALDN09, Text: All of nature's children must rest sometime.
StringRef: 3746, Sound: FALDN10, Text: There is much to do, and little time to waste.
StringRef: 3747, Sound: FALDN11, Text: I am wounded.
StringRef: 3748, Sound: FALDN12, Text: The sanctity of these woods must be preserved.
StringRef: 3749, Sound: FALDN13, Text: Cities are a blight upon the beauty of nature.
StringRef: 3750, Sound: FALDN17, Text: Nature is all.
StringRef: 3751, Sound: FALDN18, Text: I am one with nature.
StringRef: 3752, Sound: FALDN19, Text: You want something?
StringRef: 3753, Sound: FALDN20, Text: I will do that.
StringRef: 3754, Sound: FALDN21, Text: Of course.
StringRef: 3755, Sound: FALDN22, Text: *grunt*
StringRef: 3756, Sound: FALDN23, Text: Why must man always despoil the Oak Father's gifts?
StringRef: 3757, Sound: FALDN24, Text: Man is the least grateful of nature's children.
StringRef: 3758, Sound: FALDN25, Text: Oak Father, please forgive your wayward brood.
StringRef: 3759, Sound: FALDN26, Text: I am angry, don't talk to me now.
StringRef: 3760, Sound: FALDN27, Text: You are a fool, Jaheira, to think that man can live with nature and not destroy it. 
StringRef: 3761, Sound: FALDN28, Text: You dilute our order with your compassionate attitude. 
StringRef: 3762, Sound: FALDN29, Text: One day, woman, you and I will settle our differences.
StringRef: 3763, Sound: FALDN30, Text: Jaheira, your choice of a mate suits your weakling nature. 
StringRef: 3765, Sound: FALDN31, Text: It's time that I rid our fellowship of your unwholesome influence.
StringRef: 3766, Sound: FALDN32, Text: I don't know why you speak to me so.
StringRef: 3767, Sound: FALDN33, Text: I have no quarrel with you. Please—don't create one.
StringRef: 3768, Sound: FALDN34, Text: I thank you.
StringRef: 3770, Sound: FALDN35, Text: You have more wisdom than the others give you credit for.
StringRef: 3771, Sound: FALDN36, Text: I am glad to adventure with one who respects our Oak Father's kingdom.
StringRef: 3773, Sound: FALDN37, Text: Your shallow regard for nature sickens me. 
StringRef: 3774, Sound: FALDN40, Text: Death is a natural end that everyone must face.
StringRef: 3775, Sound: FALDN41, Text: Her poisonous influence has been ended.
StringRef: 3776, Sound: ELDOT01, Text: Gentlemen, gentlewomen, may I introduce myself? I am Eldoth Kron.
StringRef: 3777, Sound: ELDOT02, Text: Better a coward than a dead man.
StringRef: 3778, Sound: ELDOT03, Text: If we must.
StringRef: 3779, Sound: ELDOT04, Text: I am glad to be associated with such a fine group of gentlemen.
StringRef: 3780, Sound: ELDOT05, Text: This party's direction seems to be somewhat misguided.
StringRef: 3781, Sound: ELDOT06, Text: I don't know how much longer I can bear the company of so many fools.
StringRef: 3782, Sound: ELDOT07, Text: Goodbye now, hope to never see you again.
StringRef: 3783, Sound: ELDOT08, Text: I take this responsibility knowing I am best suited for it.
StringRef: 3784, Sound: ELDOT09, Text: I think it would be well to stop and rest.
StringRef: 3785, Sound: ELDOT10, Text: If I wanted to live a life of tedium, I would have become a monk.
StringRef: 3786, Sound: ELDOT11, Text: Help, my injuries are grievous.
StringRef: 3787, Sound: ELDOT17, Text: You're so dull.
StringRef: 3788, Sound: ELDOT18, Text: What's your worry?
StringRef: 3789, Sound: ELDOT19, Text: Don't bore me.
StringRef: 3790, Sound: ELDOT20, Text: As you command.
StringRef: 3791, Sound: ELDOT21, Text: Certainly.
StringRef: 3792, Sound: ELDOT22, Text: This is so tedious.
StringRef: 3793, Sound: ELDOT23, Text: There is no evil but stupidity.
StringRef: 3794, Sound: ELDOT24, Text: There is no good or evil, only the charming and the tedious.
StringRef: 3795, Sound: ELDOT25, Text: Only shallow people don't judge by appearance.
StringRef: 3796, Sound: ELDOT26, Text: The first duty in life is to be as artificial as possible.
StringRef: 3810, Sound: ELDOT27, Text: Skie, my little angel, a woman should know her place.
StringRef: 3811, Sound: ELDOT28, Text: Skie, don't bother me right now.
StringRef: 3812, Sound: ELDOT29, Text: Be silent, Skie! It's not like your opinion is worth anything.
StringRef: 3813, Sound: ELDOT30, Text: Shar-Teel, your lot in life is to bake cookies and bear children. Now shut up.
StringRef: 3814, Sound: ELDOT31, Text: Stop your whining, wench.
StringRef: 3815, Sound: ELDOT32, Text: Your wit is somewhat lacking.
StringRef: 3816, Sound: ELDOT33, Text: I knew that.
StringRef: 3817, Sound: ELDOT34, Text: Don't try my patience.
StringRef: 3818, Sound: ELDOT35, Text: Perhaps we could talk over wine tonight. I've never met a lady such as you and am desirous to know you better.
StringRef: 3819, Sound: ELDOT36, Text: Try to keep quiet and speak only when spoken to.
StringRef: 3820, Sound: ELDOT37, Text: You must be the most uninteresting person I have had the honor of knowing.
StringRef: 3821, Sound: ELDOT40, Text: Too bad.
StringRef: 3822, Sound: ELDOT41, Text: The wench had it coming.
StringRef: 3824, Sound: CORAN02, Text: This adventure has gotten out of hand.
StringRef: 3825, Sound: CORAN04, Text: I think we all deserve a pat on the back.
StringRef: 3826, Sound: CORAN05, Text: I cannot give my approval for what we've just done.
StringRef: 3827, Sound: CORAN06, Text: If our fellowship continues in this vein, I may have to leave.
StringRef: 3828, Sound: CORAN07, Text: I can't stay with this group any longer. I have to call it quits. 
StringRef: 3829, Sound: CORAN08, Text: I think my new responsibility will be a great deal of fun.
StringRef: 3830, Sound: CORAN09, Text: Even the most prolific adventurer must take some time to rest.
StringRef: 3831, Sound: CORAN10, Text: My worst hate is reserved for sitting and doing nothing.
StringRef: 3832, Sound: CORAN11, Text: It's only a flesh wound.
StringRef: 3838, Sound: CORAN22, Text: Wherever fate takes me.
StringRef: 3839, Sound: CORAN23, Text: The storm is always preferable to the calm.
StringRef: 3840, Sound: CORAN24, Text: The essence of pleasure is spontaneity. 
StringRef: 3841, Sound: CORAN25, Text: You can't live without a little adventure.
StringRef: 3842, Sound: CORAN26, Text: Luck is always on the side of the romantic.
StringRef: 3843, Sound: CORAN27, Text: Safana, you are full of such subtle wit and charm.
StringRef: 3844, Sound: CORAN28, Text: Sometimes, Safana, I find myself attracted to you, despite your shallow spiteful demeanor.
StringRef: 3845, Sound: CORAN29, Text: You've been dominating my thoughts recently, Safana. It's distracting my work.
StringRef: 3846, Sound: CORAN30, Text: If you weren't such a self serving wench, I... don't think I'd find you half as attractive.
StringRef: 3847, Sound: CORAN31, Text: Admit it, Safana! You sometimes find me to your liking.
StringRef: 3848, Sound: CORAN32, Text: You are rather uncouth today.
StringRef: 3849, Sound: CORAN33, Text: I don't appreciate your humor.
StringRef: 3850, Sound: CORAN34, Text: I accept your compliments.
StringRef: 3851, Sound: CORAN35, Text: A fine figure like yours shouldn't be risked in an occupation such as adventuring.
StringRef: 3852, Sound: CORAN36, Text: A more beautiful girl I don't think I've laid eyes on.
StringRef: 3853, Sound: CORAN37, Text: You have the most beautiful... er... eyes.
StringRef: 3854, Sound: CORAN40, Text: I grieve to lose a friend.
StringRef: 3855, Sound: CORAN41, Text: I wish we had more time to know each other, Safana.
StringRef: 3856, Sound: BRANW01, Text: By the ice breath of Auril! 'Tis good to see new faces and taste freedom again. 
StringRef: 3857, Sound: BRANW02, Text: Tempus, forgive my cowardice.
StringRef: 3859, Sound: BRANW04, Text: I am proud to stand among such strong warriors.
StringRef: 3860, Sound: BRANW05, Text: Our actions are not those of warrior born.
StringRef: 3861, Sound: BRANW06, Text: What sort of craven cowards are we?
StringRef: 3863, Sound: BRANW08, Text: I have always dreamt of leading such a worthy band.
StringRef: 3864, Sound: BRANW09, Text: I'm tired.
StringRef: 3865, Sound: BRANW10, Text: Damn the icicles of Auril. I'm BORED.
StringRef: 3866, Sound: BRANW11, Text:  'Tis but a flesh wound. 
StringRef: 3873, Sound: BRANW23, Text:  'Tis better to die on your feet than live on your knees.
StringRef: 3874, Sound: BRANW24, Text: May Auril bestow the frost kiss upon our enemies.
StringRef: 3875, Sound: BRANW25, Text: By Valkur's strapping buttocks.
StringRef: 3876, Sound: BRANW26, Text: A god's favor is fickle, at best.
StringRef: 3877, Sound: BRANW27, Text: Shar-Teel seems to have more spine that a lot of the men in this party.
StringRef: 3878, Sound: BRANW28, Text: You are valiant of action, Shar-Teel. A pity your spirit is mismatched.
StringRef: 3879, Sound: BRANW29, Text: Stay well clear of me, you foul speakin' heretic!
StringRef: 3880, Sound: BRANW30, Text: Tempus would guide your wayward soul, if you let him.
StringRef: 3881, Sound: BRANW31, Text: May Tempus someday show you the error of your ways.
StringRef: 3882, Sound: BRANW32, Text: I do not take such insults lightly.
StringRef: 3883, Sound: BRANW33, Text: I thank you for your kind words.
StringRef: 3884, Sound: BRANW34, Text: Do not mock me!
StringRef: 3885, Sound: BRANW35, Text: You shame this party by your mere presence.
StringRef: 3886, Sound: BRANW36, Text: You are a strong warrior. I respect that.
StringRef: 3887, Sound: BRANW37, Text: In a war of virtues, thou art unarmed.
StringRef: 3888, Sound: BRANW40, Text: To die in battle is the most glorious death of all.
StringRef: 3889, Sound: BRANW41, Text:  'Tis a shame to lose such an accomplished warrior.
StringRef: 3890, Sound: SKIEE01, Text: Eldoth! I thought I'd never see you again. Who are you? What are you doing here?
StringRef: 3891, Sound: SKIEE02, Text: Please, heeeeeelp me!
StringRef: 3892, Sound: SKIEE04, Text: You're the finest group of friends I've ever had.
StringRef: 3893, Sound: SKIEE05, Text: I don't think what we're doing is morally right.
StringRef: 3894, Sound: SKIEE06, Text: All of you are such pigs.
StringRef: 3896, Sound: SKIEE07, Text: I can't take this any more. I'm going back home!
StringRef: 3897, Sound: SKIEE08, Text: I don't know if I can handle this leadership thing, but I'm going to try.
StringRef: 3898, Sound: SKIEE09, Text: I'm getting tired. Couldn't we take a rest soon?
StringRef: 3900, Sound: SKIEE10, Text: I'm so bored.
StringRef: 3901, Sound: SKIEE11, Text: Ahhhh, I'm hurt. Heeelllppp!
StringRef: 3902, Sound: SKIEE17, Text: Can I help you?
StringRef: 3903, Sound: SKIEE18, Text: I broke a nail.
StringRef: 3904, Sound: SKIEE19, Text: I've mussed my hair. 
StringRef: 3905, Sound: SKIEE20, Text: My feet hurt.
StringRef: 3906, Sound: SKIEE21, Text: I have a cold.
StringRef: 3907, Sound: SKIEE22, Text: I have a headache.
StringRef: 3908, Sound: SKIEE23, Text: Do you like my perfume?
StringRef: 3909, Sound: SKIEE24, Text: It's been so long since I've had a hot meal.
StringRef: 3910, Sound: SKIEE25, Text: Let's go shopping!
StringRef: 3911, Sound: SKIEE26, Text: I want to go home.
StringRef: 3912, Sound: SKIEE27, Text: Eldoth, why do you treat our companions so badly?
StringRef: 3913, Sound: SKIEE28, Text: I love you, Eldoth.
StringRef: 3914, Sound: SKIEE29, Text: Why do you always have to make fun of me?! I hate you! Get away from me!
StringRef: 3916, Sound: SKIEE30, Text: I'd love to hear your music, Garrick.
StringRef: 3917, Sound: SKIEE31, Text: Eldoth is a kind man. He cares about me, Garrick.
StringRef: 3918, Sound: SKIEE32, Text: I'm sorry, did I do something wrong?
StringRef: 3919, Sound: SKIEE33, Text: Eldoth, tell them to stop being so cruel.
StringRef: 3920, Sound: SKIEE34, Text: Th-thank you, you're very kind.
StringRef: 3921, Sound: SKIEE35, Text: You're a good friend.
StringRef: 3922, Sound: SKIEE36, Text: I feel safe with you in the party.
StringRef: 3923, Sound: SKIEE37, Text: I think you're a beautiful person.
StringRef: 3924, Sound: SKIEE40, Text: *sniffle* I can't believe he's dead.
StringRef: 3926, Sound: SKIEE41, Text: What am I going to do? *sniffle* You can't die, Eldoth, you can't.
StringRef: 3928, Sound: DYNAH01, Text: Minsc continues to make the most... unique of acquaintances. To follow his charge, thou art brave indeed.
StringRef: 3929, Sound: DYNAH02, Text: These odds are idiocy! Retreat!
StringRef: 3930, Sound: DYNAH03, Text: For right! And I always am!
StringRef: 3931, Sound: DYNAH04, Text: This group shows promise exceptional.
StringRef: 3932, Sound: DYNAH05, Text: Must I watch over this group as a nanny the child?!
StringRef: 3933, Sound: DYNAH06, Text: I cannot abide by this decision! 'Tis idiocy!
StringRef: 3934, Sound: DYNAH07, Text: Thy manner is inexplicably evil! I take my leave!
StringRef: 3935, Sound: DYNAH08, Text: A wise choice to appoint the wiser.
StringRef: 3936, Sound: DYNAH09, Text: Magic does not nest well in a tired mind. I must sleep.
StringRef: 3937, Sound: DYNAH10, Text: Might we move on?
StringRef: 3938, Sound: DYNAH11, Text: By the Three, I do not feel well inside.
StringRef: 3939, Sound: DYNAH13, Text: Such bustle! The cities of Rashemen are empty compared.
StringRef: 3940, Sound: DYNAH17, Text: Thy called?
StringRef: 3941, Sound: DYNAH18, Text: Whatever thy need.
StringRef: 3942, Sound: DYNAH19, Text: Thy wish my ear?
StringRef: 3943, Sound: DYNAH20, Text: As directed.
StringRef: 3944, Sound: DYNAH21, Text: No less than done.
StringRef: 3945, Sound: DYNAH22, Text: As well as I can.
StringRef: 3946, Sound: DYNAH23, Text: Go here! Do that! What about MY needs?
StringRef: 3947, Sound: DYNAH24, Text: These boots were made for walking, and that's just what they'll do.
StringRef: 3948, Sound: DYNAH25, Text: Who art thou to touch me like you know me?!
StringRef: 3949, Sound: DYNAH26, Text: Watch thee where thy place that pointer!
StringRef: 3950, Sound: DYNAH27, Text: Must thou keep that rodent so close? 'Tis surely unclean.
StringRef: 3951, Sound: DYNAH28, Text: Stand easy, Minsc! Thy needs not be so motherly.
StringRef: 3952, Sound: DYNAH29, Text: Evil to thy cause? Perhaps. However, those of decent nature know otherwise.
StringRef: 3953, Sound: DYNAH30, Text: Any protection would be courtesy, not necessity. My power is no less than thine!
StringRef: 3954, Sound: DYNAH31, Text: Thou shalt not question my will once I present thy neck to the Orthlor! 
StringRef: 3955, Sound: DYNAH32, Text: I pray thee did not kiss thy mother with that mouth.
StringRef: 3956, Sound: DYNAH33, Text: Thou art right indeed. After my own heart.
StringRef: 3957, Sound: DYNAH34, Text: Thou art fluent in compliments. Some might say effluent.
StringRef: 3958, Sound: DYNAH35, Text: I'll thank thee to remain downwind. 'Tis hard to cast spells while I gag. 
StringRef: 3959, Sound: DYNAH36, Text: I should keep an eye towards Edwin. One can only expect treachery from his kind.
StringRef: 3960, Sound: DYNAH37, Text: Thy decency is refreshing when so many we meet are... lacking.
StringRef: 3961, Sound: DYNAH40, Text: No more mistakes, people! We can afford no more losses!
StringRef: 3962, Sound: DYNAH41, Text: Minsc! His mighty berserker wrath will not go unremembered.
StringRef: 4007, Sound: JAHER01, Text: How long must we wait here? Things stir to the south as we sit!
StringRef: 4026, Sound: JAHER21, Text: As you direct.
StringRef: 4032, Sound: JAHER27, Text: Khalid, my dear, 'twould take a sailor to untie that tongue.
StringRef: 4033, Sound: JAHER28, Text: Insufferable?
StringRef: 4034, Sound: JAHER29, Text: Beautiful?
StringRef: 4035, Sound: JAHER30, Text: Do you claim to fight evil while you are diabolic yourself?
StringRef: 4036, Sound: JAHER31, Text: I know not your goals, but you are nearly Zhentish in spirit. 'Tis disgusting.
StringRef: 4037, Sound: JAHER32, Text: You demonstrate your own pettiness. It saves me the trouble, so I take no offense. 
StringRef: 4038, Sound: JAHER33, Text: Careful. Ground tongue makes excellent fertilizer, especially with what you're spewing. 
StringRef: 4039, Sound: JAHER34, Text: Is grass not made of blades? Do stars not shoot? Nature be well armed, and demands so of her servants!
StringRef: 4040, Sound: JAHER35, Text: You are amusing, in a "what the hell is wrong with you" kind of way.
StringRef: 4041, Sound: JAHER36, Text: Seldom do I find so little fault with someone. I hope it lasts.
StringRef: 4042, Sound: JAHER37, Text: Keep your distance. I doubt your motives are as you claim.
StringRef: 4043, Sound: JAHER40, Text: No sorrow for those lost in righteous battles.
StringRef: 4044, Sound: JAHER41, Text: Blast it, Khalid! You die, and I swear you'll never hear the end of it!
StringRef: 4045, Sound: KHALD01, Text: C-calm yourself, dear. We must proceed c-c-carefully.
StringRef: 4046, Sound: KHALD02, Text: Better part of valor! Better part of valor!
StringRef: 4047, Sound: KHALD03, Text: Oh, my heart's really not in this!
StringRef: 4048, Sound: KHALD04, Text: Gorion would be proud of your actions.
StringRef: 4049, Sound: KHALD05, Text: Gorion would have none of this! 'Tis shameful!
StringRef: 4050, Sound: KHALD06, Text: I'll not have a part in this! Change your course lest I be forced to s-stop you!
StringRef: 4051, Sound: KHALD07, Text: I will not allow this! It—it's utterly evil!
StringRef: 4052, Sound: KHALD08, Text: If you wish, but I'm not a very inspiring leader.
StringRef: 4053, Sound: KHALD09, Text: *yawn* I think much c-c-clearer with—with rest. Might we stop?
StringRef: 4054, Sound: KHALD10, Text: I prefer these long periods of relaxation. Lovely day for it.
StringRef: 4055, Sound: KHALD11, Text: I am getting weaker. I'll need a healer as soon as possible.
StringRef: 4056, Sound: KHALD12, Text: I am much more at ease in the forest.
StringRef: 4057, Sound: KHALD13, Text: Cities are always so intimidating. So many people.
StringRef: 4058, Sound: KHALD14, Text: T-there are S-SO many places I would rather be.
StringRef: 4059, Sound: KHALD15, Text: Sunny or not, 'tis nice to enjoy the out-of-doors.
StringRef: 4060, Sound: KHALD16, Text: Even with infravision, I prefer the daylight.
StringRef: 4061, Sound: KHALD17, Text: C-Can I help you?
StringRef: 4062, Sound: KHALD18, Text: You have need of me?
StringRef: 4064, Sound: KHALD20, Text: If none are better.
StringRef: 4065, Sound: KHALD21, Text: I can but try.
StringRef: 4066, Sound: KHALD22, Text: I'll do my best.
StringRef: 4067, Sound: KHALD23, Text: If at first I don't succeed, the wife won't let me forget.

If you have a Mage, Cleric, or Druid in your party, your character must memorize spells using the Rest button on the Mage Book or Priest Scroll pages. To get to these pages, right-click on your character portrait and then select the Book or Scroll icon that appears on the left.

StringRef: 16216, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

You can look at your Inventory page by right-clicking on your character portrait.

StringRef: 16217, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

Equip items by placing them in the appropriate slots around your character on the Inventory page. Once equipped, you can pick the weapon you wish to use by left-clicking on the Quick Weapon slot at the bottom of the main gameplay screen. A green box will appear around the weapon that is in your character's hands; an orange box indicates combat mode.

StringRef: 16218, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text: 
_
You can pause the game at any time by hitting the space bar or left-clicking on the clock face. Unpausing occurs the same way. Pausing is most useful during combat where it gives you the time to carefully orchestrate your party's attack.

StringRef: 16219, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

Buy items by talking to the keeper of a store or inn. You can also rest your party by renting a room, try to hear a few rumors over a mug of ale, or attempt a little shoplifting. In the Buy/Sell screen, items that the currently selected character cannot use (due to class limitations or weapon proficiencies) will be tinted red, though others in your party may have a use for them. 

StringRef: 16220, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

While in temples, talk to the priests as you would an innkeeper. They offer an array of useful services, and you will often be able to heal your party, purchase specialty items, or identify treasures acquired during your travels.

Thieves access their skills using the icons along the bottom of their screen. "Thieving" includes Open Locks, Pick Pockets, and Remove Trap, when used in conjunction with the appropriate targets (chests, people, and traps, respectively). "Find Traps" examines a general area and outlines found traps in red. "Stealth" uses Move Silently and Hide in Shadows to render a Thief effectively invisible until their next attack. That attack is automatically a backstab, increasing the damage of a successful hit dramatically.

StringRef: 16222, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

Clerics and Paladins have the ability to Turn Undead. Activating this icon will cause many undead creatures to flee or even be destroyed. When in this mode, the character can move wherever they wish. Any other action, such as attacking or casting a spell, will deactivate the ability. 

StringRef: 16223, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text: 
_
Bards can inspire their comrades in combat by use of the Bard Song. They are able to move when singing, but any other action will end the song. While they may be rogues, Bards primarily concern themselves with people. Because of this, they can pick pockets but lack the other thieving skills. 

StringRef: 16224, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

Open doors by left-clicking on the doorway. The mouse pointer will change into a door icon when in the right position and the door will be outlined in blue. Your party can then enter the building if you left-click on the area just inside the door. 

StringRef: 16225, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text:

Direct your selected character to climb stairs by moving the pointer to the top of a stairway and left-clicking. The graphic will change to a stair icon when in the right spot.

StringRef: 16226, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text: 
_
Hostile creatures have red circles around their feet. Left-clicking within the circle will direct your character to attack. You can switch weapons using the Quick Weapon icons. The weapon outlined in green is the current weapon. Attack with fists only (empty Quick Slot) if you only wish to knock your opponent unconscious. If you have a character with magical abilities, try casting a spell using their Spell icons. 

StringRef: 16227, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text: 
_
If you are having trouble coordinating your attacks, try pressing the space bar to pause the game. While paused, issue your commands. When you unpause the game, your characters will obey the orders you have given them.

StringRef: 16228, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text: 
_
Interaction defaults to Talk for neutral targets and Attack for hostile targets. To talk to a neutral character (neutrals are identified by blue circles), left-click on one of them. Don't forget to select one of your party members to do the talking. If you would like to talk to a hostile character, select the Talk icon and then left-click on the character. If you would like to attack a neutral, select a weapon icon and then left-click on the target.

StringRef: 16229, Sound: TEXTPOP, Text: 
_
Wizards, Clerics, Druids, and Bards can all cast spells. Select their Cast Spell button, choose a spell, and left-click on your target. You can also configure Quick Spells by right-clicking on a Quick Spell slot. This summons a list of memorized spells to choose. If no spells are listed, the character either does not have any spells memorized or cannot cast until higher levels. To cast the Quick Spell, left-click on the appropriate Quick Spell slot and then select your target.

StringRef: 64725, Sound: SARMAT10, Text: I cannot understand why she would falsely accuse me. She is a good woman. When I was growing up with Ardic, her son, she was like a second mother to me.
StringRef: 64734, Sound: SARMAT11, Text: I regret that there is nothing more I can tell you. You must speak to the countess at her home to find the reasons behind her actions.

StringRef: 120301, Sound: ANDAR51, Text: Я, Эндар Большое Сердце из племени Черного Льва, приветствую тебя. Твое имя известно нам, <CHARNAME>, как имя человека, который твердо стоял на защите Ролгана на суде. С тобой и с твоими предками да пребудет отныне слава. Мы не те, кто копит сокровища, все, что мы может дать - это признательность нашего племени. Но если я могу что-нибудь сделать для тебя, просто скажи, и это будет сделано.
StringRef: 120302, Sound: ANDAR52, Text: Ты, <CHARNAME>, больше не желанный гость в нашем племени. Ты обещал защитить Ролгана, а он мертв. Данное тобой слово нарушено, отныне лишь позор пребудет с тобой и с твоими предками!

StringRef: 121237, Sound: ARCHEL05, Text:  Снова здесь, <CHARNAME>? Могу ли я чем-нибудь помочь тебе?
StringRef: 121404, Sound: ASHIR602, Text: По твоему виду я понимаю, что ты не из мира Азалла, но я все равно благодарю тебя за помощь.
StringRef: 121405, Sound: ASHIR603, Text: Если бы не твое вмешательство, боюсь, эти чешуйчатые захватчики уже убили бы меня. Меня зовут Ашира из Сияющего ордена. Я из города Сахаладар.
StringRef: 121407, Sound: ASHIR604, Text: Моя одежда обычна для моего народа, хотя, наверное, она кажется тебе такой же странной, как и мне твоя.
StringRef: 121408, Sound: ASHIR605, Text: Что же касается имени Арибет, оно мне незнакомо. Она была твоей спутницей?
StringRef: 121411, Sound: ASHIR606, Text: Мораг? Мне знакомо это имя. Это королева чешуйчатых захватчиков! Ее лицо преследует меня во сне, ее голос нашептывает обещание огромной силы, соблазняя меня отвернуться от своего народа.
StringRef: 121412, Sound: ASHIR607, Text: Но я член Сияющего ордена и служу Сахаладару, величайшему из плавучих городов Азалла. Я поклялась уничтожить Мораг и спасти свой народ.
StringRef: 121418, Sound: ASHIR623, Text: Я не Арибет, я Ашира. Но в этом необычном месте пересекается множество миров и планов бытия.
StringRef: 121419, Sound: ASHIR608, Text: Все жители островов Азалла знают о Сахаладаре, городе над морем, обласканном волнами. Шпили моего родного города сверкают подобно кораллам в лазурных водах.
StringRef: 121420, Sound: ASHIR615, Text: После долгих поисков волшебникам Сахаладара удалось обнаружить в моем мире портал - ворота, ведущие в этот псевдоплан, в котором пересекаются многие вселенные.
StringRef: 121421, Sound: ASHIR617, Text: Древние ищут способ вернуться в их былой мир, но для этого им требуются рабы и ресурсы из других, более слабых миров.
StringRef: 121422, Sound: ASHIR627, Text: Ашира, страж Сахаладара, - не предательница! На всех островах Азалла верят моему слову, и никто не сомневается в моей чести!
StringRef: 121427, Sound: ASHIR624, Text: Возможно, та, которую ты называешь Арибет, является моей параллелью в твоем мире, или я являюсь ее параллелью, если тебе так проще. Может быть, поэтому нам с тобой и довелось встретиться.
StringRef: 121429, Sound: ASHIR609, Text: В глубинах под нашим плавучим островом находится дивная столица Килмов, водных жителей, с которыми мы мирно соседствуем в нашем мире.
StringRef: 121430, Sound: ASHIR616, Text: Были избраны шестеро для того, чтобы пройти через портал, хотя мы знали, что никогда не вернемся. Мои спутники давно уже пали.
StringRef: 121431, Sound: ASHIR618, Text: Мораг наслала на мой мир чешуйчатых захватчиков. Азалле еще никогда не приходилось бороться с таким сильным врагом. Их первобытная жестокость поражала, как, впрочем, и их внешность.
StringRef: 121437, Sound: ASHIR625, Text: Ты говоришь, что эта Арибет предала свою веру и сдалась злобной силе Мораг. Возможно, мы с тобой встретились именно затем, чтобы я помогла тебе отомстить за ее падение.
StringRef: 121439, Sound: ASHIR616, Text: Кроме меня не осталось никого из защитников моего народа, но я, как и мои павшие товарищи, не исполнила назначенного.
StringRef: 121441, Sound: ASHIR619, Text: Чешуйчатые захватчики ограбили мой беззащитный мир и лишили его многих магических сокровищ, принеся мой народ в жертву во время странных ритуалов, чтобы увеличить силу их королевы.
StringRef: 121444, Sound: ASHIR626, Text: Я верный рыцарь Сияющего Ордена Сахаладара. Возможно, я перенеслась сюда из Азалла, чтобы очистить имя Арибет, искупить ее грехи своими поступками.
StringRef: 121446, Sound: ASHIR620, Text: Месть - всего лишь одна из причин, почему я здесь. Мой мир был миролюбив и уязвим. Поэтому мы и пострадали одними из первых.
StringRef: 121448, Sound: ASHIR621, Text: Но чем больше растет сила Мораг, тем больше Древних пробуждается. Скоро армия из ее приспешников ворвется в родной мир Древних, чтобы вновь поработить его.
StringRef: 121449, Sound: ASHIR622, Text: Затем Мораг будет порабощать мир за миром, и все на собственном примере узнают, как страдала Азалла. Я прибыла сюда, чтобы помешать этому, но мне это не удалось.
StringRef: 121450, Sound: ASHIR630, Text: Да закипит океан алой пеной от крови чешуйчатых захватчиков!
StringRef: 121588, Sound: HAERD112, Text: Тебе нужно использовать Слова, чтобы попасть непосредственно в Камень-Источник и сразиться с Мораг, пока ее магия не стала слишком могущественной!

StringRef: 121686, Sound: MAUGR058, Text: Раса Созидателей возродится, и на тебе я впервые испробую силу, которой наделила меня моя королева!
StringRef: 121708, Sound: NASHE125, Text: Довольно, Аарин. <CHARNAME>, если желаешь поговорить с Хэдралин, то пожалуйста. Но я не отпущу ее из подземелья, пока у ворот города стоит враг.
