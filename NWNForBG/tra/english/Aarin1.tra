@0 = ~NP: Excuse me, but where is <CHARNAME>? I'll only talk to him.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. I am searching for the Words of Power.*/
@1 = ~NP: Excuse me, but where is <CHARNAME>? I'll only talk to her.~ /*My name is <CHARNAME>. I work for Aarin Gend.*/
@2 = ~NP: Hey, buddy. I understand you helped rid Neverwinter of the Howling Death. Allow me to congratulate you on the successful completion of that task. You have demonstrated a rare amount of courage and resourcefulness. Both of which you will need to accomplish your task.~ [AARIN227] /*Hail, friend. You were instrumental in ridding Neverwinter of the Wailing Death, I understand. Allow me to congratulate you on a job well done.*/
@3 = ~But that is not how we should begin. I am known as Aarin Gend, and I have served our Lord Nasher for some time. Hopefully I may be of similar use to you now.~ [AARIN229]
@4 = ~How, exactly, can you help me?~
@5 = ~Pleased to meet you. My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@6 = ~What is my mission?~
@7 = ~Aribeth told me I should speak to you.~
@8 = ~Indeed. I know who you are. There are many who whisper your name right now, and it is my business to listen to them all.~ [AARIN291]
@9 = ~You have not spoken to Aribeth, then? Perhaps it would be better if you did so, and then returned to me, for I have much that I need to tell you of.~ [AARIN292]
@10 = ~I have much to pass onto you, friend... but first you should speak to our lady Aribeth. Once you have done so, return to me.~ [AARIN290]
@11 = ~You have spoken to the paladin, then? Excellent. It is for her to pass on the commands of Lord Nasher and not I.~ [AARIN293]
@12 = ~NP: My place is in the shadows. I have many eyes and ears in the northern lands, and I must inform Lord Nasher where the poisonous snakes lurk. Had I foreseen the actions of this cult, I could have prevented the disaster. But these people have been very skillful in keeping out of my sight. But I will not blame myself for the mistake I made, and instead I will do my best to rectify it.... And to do that, I will give you all the information I have to help you find out where this new nest of vipers is hiding.~ [AARIN230] /*Instead of recriminating myself for my failure, I must do what I can to repair the damage... and that is to offer what information I have to you so that you may find where this new nest of vipers hides.*/
@13 = ~NP: The search for a cult

Thanks to our efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved, and those residents still alive are no longer threatened by the Howling Death. However, Dester, the man who spread the plague, did not act alone. He was aided and abetted by a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be located somewhere north of Neverwinter.

After the long quarantine of the city was lifted and Lady Aribeth Fentick's lover was hanged, she moved her investigative headquarters to a settlement in Port Llast, that town being the northernmost member of the Union of Lords. She has once again appealed to the adventurers to neutralize the cult's actions, in whatever way they manifest themselves. The cult's location must also be found and its leaders brought to justice. Aaryn Gend, the chief spy in the service of the Union of Lords, explained that the first clue to the cult's location lies east of Port Llast, in the caves hidden in the hills. There live humanoid monsters, which recently began to attack people, which is unusual for them. If this path of investigation leads nowhere, Aaryn advises to look in Luskan to the north, in the Neverwinter Forest to the east, or in the wastelands of the southern road. To find out the exact location of the cult, two different pieces of evidence must be gathered.~ /*Through your valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be based somewhere north of Neverwinter.
With the city's long quarantine lifted and her lover, Fenthick, hanged, Lady Aribeth has moved the base of her investigation to the township of Port Llast, northernmost member of the Lords' Alliance. There she has once again put out a call to adventurers to seek out the cult's corruption wherever it may lie. The cult's base must be discovered and its leaders brought to justice. Standing guard over Aribeth at the local mercenary barracks is Aarin Gend, a Spymaster in the service of the Alliance. She has encouraged all adventurers to work closely with him in their ongoing search of the region.

Aarin Gend has explained that the best lead for locating the cult lies to the north of Port Llast, in a series of caves that lie in the hills. They are inhabited by humanoid monsters that have been performing unusual raids. Should this avenue of investigation not prove worthwhile, the spymaster suggests searching either Luskan to the north, Neverwinter Wood to the east or the wildlands of the South Road. Two separate and corroborating pieces of evidence are needed to prove the cultÂ’s location.*/
@14 = ~Aribeth has informed you of where you must search, yes? She has told you of how you may root out these fiends?~ [AARIN233]
@15 = ~She said you would explain the details.~
@16 = ~Just tell me what I need to know.~
@17 = ~I'm still not clear on what I'm supposed to be doing.~
@18 = ~Unearthing the cult will not be a simple task. What few whispers I have collected, however, have allowed me to narrow your search to this region.~ [AARIN234]
@19 = ~Impatient for the kill, are we? Just be wary, friend. Running forward too fast is a good way to find a cliff.~ [AARIN286]
@20 = ~NP: Lord Nasher's subordinates rush to restore lost order to Neverwinter. It is obvious that the city is in chaos, and there are many predators in the hungry north. So it falls on our-- I mean, on your shoulders. to find the sectarians who are primarily responsible for the spread of the disease. We know very little about them. We don't know who they are, where their base is, why they started spreading the pestilence... or what other diabolical crime they're plotting against us.~ [AARIN287] /*Many of Lord Nasher's forces make haste to restore order to the city we have left. Neverwinter's chaos is obvious, and there are many predators in the hungry north.*/
@21 = ~NP: It is imperative that we know exactly where the sect's bases are, and we must be sure that the clues we have found are not false leads. Aribet won't rest until at least two tracks lead us to the same place... and that's where your job lies. I can offer you one possibility. I've heard some strange rumors about some caves east of Port Llast. There may be sectarians hiding there.~ [AARIN235] /*It is vital that the cult's exact location be found, and that we are certain any leads we discover are not attempts at deception. Aribeth will not be satisfied until we find at least two separate leads that point to the same locale... that is your task.*/
@22 = ~NP: If unsuccessful, you can explore other destinations. The city of Luskan to the north, the Neverwinter Forest further east, and the wildlands along the South Road. However, I think it would be wisest for you to explore these caves first.~ [AARIN576] /*If not, there are other avenues for you to investigate. The city of Luskan to the north, Neverwinter Wood to the east and the wildlands of the South Road.*/
@23 = ~Tell me about these caves.~
@24 = ~NP: The caves are in the hills east of Port Llast. They have long been inhabited by tribes of orcs, bugbears, and similar creatures. Normally, they are not much of a threat. In the last few months, I have received news of strange two-legged creatures plundering the lands south of Luskan. That wouldn't be surprising... if these creatures were not now well organized and said to be led by humans.~ [AARIN572] /*The caves are in the hills to the north of Port Llast, near the Green Griffon Inn. They have long been used by humanoid tribes of orcs, bugbears and the like. They aren't usually a concern.*/
@25 = ~This leads me to believe the cult may be involved... that will be for you to determine. Just keep this in mind... no matter what you find there, Aribeth will wish two firm leads on the cult's location before she will act. We cannot afford a mistake.~ [AARIN575]
@26 = ~Tell me about these caves again.~
@27 = ~I want to know about the other places I should search.~
@28 = ~I would rather talk about something else.~
@29 = ~I'll go now.~
@30 = ~As you wish. I will certainly tell you all I know about the other places you may need to search.~ [AARIN584]
@31 = ~You tells me 'bout Luskan.~
@32 = ~Tell me of the Neverwinter Wood.~
@33 = ~Tell me of the South Road.~
@34 = ~I have some questions about Port Llast.~
@35 = ~Aye, a city of pirates and base villainy. The city itself will be closed to you now... but it will be worth your while to go in that direction anyway. You should seek out the humanoid caves by the Green Griffon.~ [AARIN238]
@36 = ~Why is Luskan closed?~
@37 = ~Tell me what you know of this city.~
@38 = ~Why do you think the cultists might be in Luskan?~
@39 = ~I have other questions.~
@40 = ~NP: Their gates have remained closed since the plague began in Neverwinter. There is anarchy in the city. its outbreak could have devastating consequences. I have been trying to pull some strings to convince the officials in Luskan that the plague is already over, but so far I have not been successful. Before the gates closed, there were rumors of battles in the streets of Luskan. Who knows what's going on out there? If I'm lucky, I'll soon be able to arrange a way for you to get inside to find out.~ [AARIN239] /*Before the gates closed, there were rumors of battles in the streets in Luskan. Who knows what transpires there? With luck I will soon arrange you a way inside to investigate.*/
@41 = ~How do I reach Luskan?~
@42 = ~The road north will lead you along the coast and directly to the city's gates. As I said. getting into the city will be more of a problem than reaching it. I will attempt to remedy that as soon as possible.~ [AARIN241]
@43 = ~NP: This city is called the City of Sails, a den of pirates and other dark folk, and is ruled by five High Captains who balance each other's interests. But the real power is in the hands of the Brotherhood of Mysteries in the Master's Tower. Even I know little about these people. It is a powerful, anarchic, and dangerous city. Luskan has repeatedly defied the Lord's Alliance..... so be careful where you enter its crooked streets, as the locals consider strangers easy prey.~ [AARIN242] /*The city is powerful, anarchic and dangerous. Luskan has challenged the Lords' Alliance more than once... be careful when you walk its streets, for many within see strangers as easy prey.*/
@44 = ~NP: There are as many evil men in Luskan as there are coins, my friend. A sect could go undetected there for a long time and gather many allies who value gold above all else. The fact that the city is closed even now that the pestilence is over and so little information is leaking out is also deeply troubling to me - it is unclear what might be going on there. Plus, I'm disturbed by the rumors of humanoid bandits who have been prowling the road between Neverwinter and Luskan. It's strange. and while it's probably due to Luskan's usual negligence, it's best to check it out.~ [AARIN245] /*Additionally, I have been troubled by reports of humanoid banditry taking place on the road between Neverwinter and Luskan. This is unusual... and while it may simply be caused by Luskan's ignorance, it should be investigated.*/
@45 = ~One of the deepest and most ancient woods of the north, my friend. It is filled with life both beautiful and dangerous, and is tended to by the order of druids.~ [AARIN248]
@46 = ~How do I get to the Neverwinter Wood?~
@47 = ~What do you know about the place?~
@48 = ~Why do you think the cultists might be there?~
@49 = ~I'd like to ask something else.~
@50 = ~Follow the road east of Port Llast. The lands are wild and sparsely populated there... and when you reach the boundaries of the great forest, you will know.~ [AARIN249]
@51 = ~NP: Like Neverwinter, the forest is heated by a magically warm river running through it. As far as I know, it is a very majestic and beautiful place. Few have gone beyond the edge of the forest, however, and it is said that the forest has a life of its own... and they don't like outsiders. The forest druids, led by the archdruid Aavil, know all that goes on in their forest. I hope they will offer you their help.~ [AARIN250] /*Like Neverwinter, the forest is warmed by the magically heated waters of the river that runs through it. It is a grand and beautiful place, I am told.*/
@52 = ~NP: Archdruid Aavil has sent several letters to Lord Nasher lately, begging for help in dealing with some unknown force that threatens the forest. Lord Nasher was going to provide the Archidruid with the required assistance, but was unable to do so due to the chaos in the city. Neverwinter comes first though.~ [AARIN253] /*Lord Nasher would have provided the help the Archdruid required, but could not due to the chaos within the city. Neverwinter must come first.*/
@53 = ~NP: Aavil had sent nothing more in recent days, so it was possible that the druids were gone. What exactly the danger was, the letters did not explain.... perhaps it has nothing to do with the affairs of this cult. In any case, my friend, you should look there. As for what happened, my friend. expect the worst.~ [AARIN255] /*Aawill has sent no more messages in recent days, and it is possible that the druids exist no more. The exact danger that was being faced was not explained... this cult may not even be involved.*/
@54 = ~The road leads eventually home to Neverwinter... but before that lay many miles of wildlands as well as the village of Charwood. The cult could hide in many places, there.~ [AARIN257]
@55 = ~How do I get to this South Road?~
@56 = ~The southern road is not so much a place you go to, my friend, as it is a route you take. It will lead you eventually to Neverwinter... but it is the region itself that concerns me.~ [AARIN258]
@57 = ~NP: Very little. As I understand it, there's been no word from Charwood village for years. It's probably deserted by now, that's all I can tell you. There are ruins everywhere, and it is said that other, very strange creatures have taken up residence in the wilderness. They also say that some powerful wizard dwells there.~ [AARIN258] /*Ruins will be common, and it is said that other, stranger, creatures have made these wildlands their home. A powerful wizard is even said to have taken residence.*/
@58 = ~NP: I have no data on this neighborhood. None. And that worries me greatly, for a cult could exist virtually openly there and I would know nothing about it. The south road I suggest for the most part for consideration. I just don't want to overlook it.... just in case my suspicions are suddenly justified.~ [AARIN261] /*I have no reports from this area. None. This disturbs me perhaps more than it should, as the cult could exist openly here and I would not even know.*/
@59 = ~There are locals who could tell you more of this town, my friend... my knowledge of it is limited.~ [AARIN263]
@60 = ~Do you think there might be cult activity here?~
@61 = ~NP: I did my best to survey Port Llast before we set up base here, my friend.... but what you say cannot be ruled out. There may well be things that have escaped my notice, so an investigation on your part would not be out of place.~ [AARIN267] /*I did my best to investigate Port Llast before we made our base here, my friend... but what you suggest is not impossible.*/
@62 = ~Aye? What would you have of me, <CHARNAME>?~ [AARIN269]
@63 = ~What will you be doing while I'm searching for the cult?~
@64 = ~How is Aribeth? Has she been well?~
@65 = ~How does Aribeth fare?~
@66 = ~I believe I have found some information on the cult.~
@67 = ~What is the situation in Neverwinter?~
@68 = ~I have questions about the region.~
@69 = ~How did you become a spymaster for Lord Nasher?~
@70 = ~You told me to ask you sometime how you met Lord Nasher.~
@71 = ~You had mentioned someone named Calli...~
@72 = ~Now you seem uncomfortable around me. Why is that?~
@73 = ~I will leave.~
@74 = ~What do you wish to know?~ [AARIN282]
@75 = ~NP: I am still Lord Nasher's chief spy, my friend. and today he needs reliable information even more than before. I must keep my eyes open at all times, even though my actions have to be coordinated from here, not from deep within the shadows. I continue to search for information about the cult that may aid you in your quest... though I doubt I'll be successful. I think you'll succeed much sooner than I will.~ [AARIN270] /*I shall continue to seek word on the cult that might aid your quest... though I have my doubts in that. You will have far more success than I, I think.*/
@76 = ~NP: I pity our noble paladin, my friend.  Her heart has been broken, her faith betrayed..... I don't think she will ever recover from it. I am informed that she is plagued by terrible nightmares that will not let her rest. In her dreams she says terrible things and scares the servants. I can only imagine what the elf sees when she closes her eyes. She won't share anything with me and won't agree to return to Neverwinter. I am really very worried about her.~ [AARIN273] /*I can only imagine what the elf sees when she closes her eyes. She will not confide in me, nor will she agree to return to Neverwinter. I worry for her, truly.*/
@77 = ~NP: Ð¯... would not speak of it, <CHARNAME>, but I am told that you and Lady Aribeth share a close friendship. Aribeth awoke from her grief, but not in the way I had hoped. She is gripped by a frightening rage that she is almost unable to control. She wanders around, immersed in her thoughts and full of bitterness, and lashes out at everyone she can get her hands on. I don't know if there's anything you can do about it... maybe you can talk to her.~ [AARIN276] /*She storms about, brooding and filled with bitterness and lashing out at all who come near her. I do not know if anything can even be done... perhaps you could speak to her.*/
@78 = ~Let me see what you have. Yes... excellent. I had full confidence in your abilities, my friend. Bring the information to Aribeth quickly... she will be eager to see it.~ [AARIN279]
@79 = ~NP: It's a grim picture. Lord Nasher says most of his army died in the plague... and the rest are needed to keep order in the city. The worst may be over now that the epidemic is over, but we're still not on our feet. It will be some time before things settle down.~ [AARIN280] /*The worst is perhaps over now that the plague is cured, but still we reel from a crippling blow. It will be some time before things return to what they were.*/
@80 = ~That is a curious question, my friend. Nor does it have a simple answer, if the truth be known, and is not a tale that I care to often tell.~ [AARIN075]
@81 = ~I'd still like to hear the tale.~
@82 = ~What do you mean? What could be so complicated about it?~
@83 = ~I'll ask you another time, then.~
@84 = ~Fine. I really don't care, anyway.~
@85 = ~NP: I mean, it's not one story. It's two different stories: how I became a spy, and how I came to know and serve Lord Nasher. I'm not a drunken bard to spill my life story to a casual acquaintance, so I usually keep it to myself.~ [AARIN120] /*I mean that it is more than one tale. How I became a spymaster is quite different from how I met and came to serve our Lord Nasher.*/
@86 = ~As you wish. Is there something else I could answer?~ [AARIN122]
@87 = ~NP: Then why do you ask? You certainly have better things to do. Anything else?~ [AARIN124] /*Then why did you ask? Surely you must have better things to do.*/
@88 = ~NP: No, I don't think so, my friend. You have more important things to focus on than me. However, I am still willing to answer your relevant questions.~ /*No, I do not think so, my friend. You have far more important things to focus on other than I. Ask me another time, perhaps.*/
@89 = ~NP: * Sigh* Suit yourself, my friend. but it's not my fault if you fall asleep while I'm talking. I began my life as a slave in the desert south of Kalimshan. And it never even occurred to me that I would become what I am today. The lush and wild jungles of my homeland, Hulta, were only familiar to me from my mother's evening stories. I had never seen those shores. My mother's master was a terrible and cruel caliph. As the child of a slave, I learned to keep out of sight and be quiet, otherwise I could earn my punishment.~ [AARIN076] /*While garments like this have been found in almost every culture with a strong contingent of spellcasters, this example and most others in the Neverwinter area are believed to have originated within Ulcaster's School of Wizardry. The school presented no bias in its teachings, and hosted casters from all across the Sword Coast until its destruction some 200 years ago.*/
@90 = ~NP: What's more, I learned to listen. I listened to the chatter of the servants, to the boring conversations of the guards. For many, many years I was a shadow of the Caliph's palace. But all my skills were of no use to anyone but me. For example, I could not save my mother when the Caliph beat her to death for spilling his liquor.~ [AARIN083] /*For all my hiding, however, I proved of no use to anyone but myself. I could not save my mother when the caliph beat her to death for spilling a tankard of his mead, for instance.*/
@91 = ~I trust you taught him a lesson.~
@92 = ~You were a child. What could you have done?~
@93 = ~That's horrible!~
@94 = ~NP: The incident had taught me a lot. I blamed myself for not warning my mother and for not stopping the Caliph. I killed the Caliph with a stab in the back, out of grief and rage, and soon I was being hunted down in the streets of Calimport.~ [AARIN085] /*In grief and anger I stabbed and killed the caliph, and was subsequently chased into the streets of Calimport.*/
@95 = ~You murdered him? How could you?~
@96 = ~Good. He deserved it.~
@97 = ~What happened to you then?~
@98 = ~NP: I blamed myself, as young people often do. I killed the Caliph with a stab in the back, out of grief and rage, and was soon hunted down in the streets of Calimport.~ [AARIN110] /*In grief and anger I stabbed and killed the caliph, and was subsequently chased into the streets of Calimport.*/
@99 = ~NP: Yes, but such is the life of a slave. I was the Caliph's shadow and I blamed myself for not stopping his hand from striking.... I was young and foolish then. Out of grief and rage, I killed the Caliph with a stab in the back, and soon I was being hunted down in the streets of Calimport.~ [AARIN111] /*Aye, but such is the life of a slave. I was the caliph's shadow, however, and I blamed myself for not stopping his blow... young and foolish as I was.*/
@100 = ~NP: I'm not proud of what I did, <CHARNAME>. It's very easy to say that this man deserved this fate. At least, he deserved it more than my mother did. But just who was I to decide that? On that day, I had no right to judge ... I wanted revenge and became the wanted killer. There's no denying it. I disappeared into the shadows of the city... and I was not alone. There were many others with me, and I considered them allies, but not friends, because we joined with them only as necessary to survive.~ [AARIN087] /*I fled into the shadows of the city... and was not alone, there. I found many who I will call allies and not friends, for we acted in unison only to survive.*/
@101 = ~NP: I was persecuted by the law, so I was always hiding and listening. The fact that I was a thief and could survive didn't help me at all.... and there came a point when even in the shadows of the city, I couldn't feel safe anymore. I looked for a way out of the city. and finally a captain took pity on me and offered me a place aboard his ship. Perhaps you've heard of Randall Red?~ [AARIN090] /*The law pursued me, so always I remained hidden and listened as I once had. The fact that I was a thief to remain alive did not help... and eventually even the shadows of the city were no longer safe for me.*/
@102 = ~I have heard of him. He was a notorious pirate.~
@103 = ~I think so. You became a pirate?~
@104 = ~No, never heard of him.~
@105 = ~Aye, that he was... a pirate who's reputation along the Sword Coast was more than deserved. I joined his crew, though I was no pirate in truth.~ [AARIN092]
@106 = ~Randall the Red deserved his reputation as a violent and cunning pirate of the swordcoast. While I joined his crew, I was not a pirate as you think of it.~ [AARIN108]
@107 = ~No? Randall the Red once held quite the reputation as a bloodthirsty pirate of the Sword Coast. I was a member of his crew, though not a pirate as you think of it.~ [AARIN109]
@108 = ~NP: I didn't have a predilection for drinking like other sailors, so I spent my time in ports making new acquaintances and listening. As the years went by, Randall came to rely more and more on my skill. He would give me gold to encourage my informants, so I was the first to know all the news. It was thanks to me that Randall was always one step ahead of his pursuers, because I knew in advance that we were about to be raided.~ [AARIN093] /*Over the years, Randall grew to depend on my skill. He gave me gold to establish informants throughout the coast, and I heard news the instant it happened.*/
@109 = ~You kept a vicious pirate alive?~
@110 = ~That sounds fair.~
@111 = ~How did you feel, being a pirate?~
@112 = ~Aye. I was his master of spies, though I would not have put a name to it at the time. I was grateful for Randall's kindness... for despite his reputation, he was an easy man to like.~ [AARIN096]
@113 = ~I was not truly a pirate. I was his master of spies, though I did not put a name to what I did. And while Randall was indeed a pirate, he was an easy man to like.~ [AARIN107]
@114 = ~NP: I didn't like the robberies and murders Randall was committing..... and I did my best to gently prevent the worst of them. Randall knew what I was doing and only tolerated it because I was very valuable to him. He didn't care that I cringed and looked away when his team was doing their bloody business. As the years passed, I became a well-known man on the Sword Coast. My life belonged to me, and I was content to do my duties as I saw fit.~ [AARIN097] /*Randall knew what I was doing and permitted it only because I was otherwise invaluable to him. He cared not if I cringed and turned a cheek when the crew plied the worst of their bloody trade.*/
@115 = ~It was not until I encountered Lord Nasher that my life would change forever. That, however, is another tale. Ask me of it some time, my friend.~ [AARIN100]
@116 = ~Thank you for telling me.~
@117 = ~I want to hear more!~
@118 = ~That's it? Bah! What a stupid tale!~
@119 = ~NP: And thank you for listening to me, <CHARNAME>. As I said, I don't tell this story very often. Well, back to more important business. Is there anything you need?~ [AARIN101] /*And thank you for listening, <CHARNAME>. As I said, it is not a tale I tell often.*/
@120 = ~NP: Ha ha! Perhaps another time, my friend. You're a great listener. Well, back to more important business. Is there anything you need?~ [AARIN104] /*Ha ha! Perhaps another time, my friend. You made for a fine audience.*/
@121 = ~NP: I'm sorry you feel that way. Maybe it's because I don't tell it often enough. Well, back to more important business. Do you need anything?~ [AARIN105] /*I am sorry you think that. Perhaps that is why I do not tell the tale often.*/
@122 = ~Aye, so I did, though I had not expected that you would be truly interested in hearing the rest of the tale. Are you sure I am not boring you?~ [AARIN126]
@123 = ~No, I truly want to hear it.~
@124 = ~Maybe I'll ask you later, then.~
@125 = ~Of course. What else would you have of me?~ [AARIN167]
@126 = ~NP: Really? No one's asked me to do that since, uh. Well, okay. I'm not usually so, how shall I put it, available. So be it. I think you may recall that I spent most of my teenage years as chief spy for the famous Randall Red? Life went on as usual. Our ship found safe harbor in Luskan, and Randall was constantly terrorizing the trade routes of Neverwinter.~ [AARIN127] /*So be it. You will recall, I hope, that I made the majority of my early fame as the spymaster for the infamous Randall the Red, aye?*/
@127 = ~NP: Lord Nasher wasn't always the elderly man you know now. When I met him, he was in his prime. a veteran of many battles and a brilliant intellect. Lord Nasher swore to put an end to Randall. He took to the sea himself and sailed from Neverwinter to find and destroy our ship.~ [AARIN130] /*Lord Nasher was not always the aged man you know now. When I first encountered him he was a man in his prime... a veteran of the sword and in possession of a brilliant mind.*/
@128 = ~So he captured you?~
@129 = ~So you left Randall the Red then?~
@130 = ~How long ago was that? You can't be that old.~
@131 = ~I have a hard time picturing Lord Nasher doing that.~
@132 = ~Not at first, no. Lord Nasher was the greatest lord of the North at the time, however, and his personal attention frightened the crew and gave Randall considerable pause.~ [AARIN132]
@133 = ~Of course not. I owed him much, and did not know this Lord Nasher at all. He was, however, the greatest lord of the north... and his personal attention gave Randall pause.~ [AARIN163]
@134 = ~I was still a young man at the time, my friend. Our Lord Nasher already had a lifetime of adventure behind him and was the greatest lord of the north.~ [AARIN164]
@135 = ~Perhaps. Once, however, Lord Nasher was reknown as the greatest lord of the north. The very idea that he was personally chasing us frightened the crew and gave Randall pause.~ [AARIN165]
@136 = ~NP: For two years we had been in competition, he and I. I did my best to learn of Lord Nasher's devious plans to capture Randall in time to get away from them. I never had to work so hard. Once he even disguised himself and his crew as Wakin priestesses carrying gold to Amn, knowing Randall would be drawn to him like a moth to a candle. It was only at the very last moment that I confirmed my suspicions and warned him. Nevertheless, Nasher's plan almost succeeded.~ [AARIN133] /*For two years we sparred, he and I. It was all I could do to discover his ingenious plots to find Randall just in time to avoid them. Never had I labored so.*/
@137 = ~NP: And eventually I betrayed Randall. He became more and more desperate and violent, robbing ships and slaughtering everyone on board. He'd never done that before. The next time the shadows told me about Lord Nasher's next plan, I... didn't do anything. I just waited and watched as Lord Nasher's men jumped off the next ship Randall had planned.~ [AARIN136] /*When next the shadows told me of Lord Nasher's latest plot, I... did nothing. I waited silently and watched as Nasher's men sprung from Randall's latest target.*/
@138 = ~You betrayed your friend?! What kind of man are you?!~
@139 = ~I suppose you did what you thought you had to do.~
@140 = ~That was incredibly stupid of you.~
@141 = ~That was a very brave thing to do.~
@142 = ~NP: Randall wasn't my real friend. He was using me, and I needed him. I had to make a choice, <CHARNAME>, and it wasn't easy. I was certain I was going to be executed, and I grimaced as I waited for the executioner to appear along with the remnants of Randall's crew. I believed my fate was sealed. I spent quite a bit of time in the dungeons of Castle Nevers. But the first person to visit me in my gloomy cell was none other than Lord Nasher himself. He was very strong, charming... and suspicious. After all, I was a famous pirate, wasn't I? He asked me only one question: "Why didn't you warn Randall Red about the attack?"~ [AARIN144] /*Feryl Dragonhunter was a monster of a man who, with four kills to his credit, thought he had perfected the art of dragon slaying. He aided his efforts by creating magical equipment from his previous victories, including several different boots he mockingly called his Dragon Slippers. Amazingly, Feryl was not defeated by his preferred enemy, but was surprised by a small band of goblins on his way to a hunt.*/
@143 = ~NP: I told him that, though I had served Randall, I could no longer let him do what he had done. Lord Nasher seemed surprised by my answer. "So you would betray any man you serve if you thought he was behaving improperly?", he asked me. And I had only one answer. I said that I would betray any man if I thought he was wrong, and that my only regret was that I had procrastinated too long with Randall.~ [AARIN149] /*"So you would betray any man you served if you did not agree with his actions?" he asked me. And I had only one answer.*/
@144 = ~How did he respond to that?~
@145 = ~What he say to that?~
@146 = ~NP: He smiled at me... and said he hoped that if he did something wrong, I would tell him first. I asked him if that meant I was now serving him. And he said, no... I serve Neverwinter. That was my sentence. I have fulfilled my sentence for twenty years now, my friend, and I am grateful to Lord Nasher for every year of those twenty.~ [AARIN152] /*I asked him if this meant I was to serve him now. To that he said no... I was to serve Neverwinter. That was to be my sentence.*/
@147 = ~NP: And you, uh. you're a prisoner?~ /*New wizard?*/
@148 = ~Lord Nasher sounds like a fine man.~
@149 = ~But you could have just left, if you wanted to.~
@150 = ~NP: Not quite, my friend. I admire Lord Nasher, and I love Neverwinter with all my heart. It's a prison that suits me perfectly. And if I were to leave, I would never meet my Cally... Ð¯...~ [AARIN155] /*Not truly, my friend. I have come to admire Lord Nasher and love Neverwinter with all my heart. It is a prison that suits me well.*/
@151 = ~What's wrong, Aarin?~
@152 = ~Calli? Is that a woman?~
@153 = ~Bah. You're not going to start crying, are you?~
@154 = ~NP: That's right, my friend, that's right. And Neverwinter is a place I love. I can't think of a prison better suited to me. And if I left, I would never have met my Cally... Ð¯...~ [AARIN161] /*That he is, my friend, that he is. And Neverwinter is a place I love. I could not have found a prison that suited me better.*/
@155 = ~NP: Maybe. I'm glad I didn't, because Lord Nasher is the best of men, and Neverwinter is a prison I'm growing to love. And if I had left, I would never have met my Cally... Ð¯...~ [AARIN162] /*Perhaps. I am glad I did not, for Lord Nasher is the best of men, and Neverwinter a prison that I have grown to love.*/
@156 = ~NP: It's, uh. nothing, my friend. Something very well forgotten...that I should not have remembered. I hope I have answered your first question. Now let's get back to discussing your task... and stop talking about me for today.~ [AARIN157] /*Your original question has been answered, I hope. Let us return to the topic of your mission and... speak no more of me, today.*/
@157 = ~NP: It's none of your business, and I shouldn't have mentioned her. Anyway, my story is over. Let's get back to your questions and not talk about me anymore.~ [AARIN160] /*It is not your concern, and I should not have mentioned her. Regardless, my tale is done.*/
@158 = ~I... did. That I mentioned her at all was by accident, my friend. I have been determined to avoid those memories for many years, now.~ [AARIN169]
@159 = ~Why? What's wrong?~
@160 = ~NP: In that case, I won't insist.~ /*And with that, I will take my leave.*/
@161 = ~NP: No, I... I don't want to talk about her, <CHARNAME>. It's not your fault. Maybe another time. Do you have any other questions?~ /*No, I... have no desire to speak of her, <CHARNAME>. It is no fault of yours. Perhaps another time.*/
@162 = ~NP: Since I don't want to talk about it, I don't have any problems. Do you have any other questions?~ [AARIN206] /*Since I do not wish to speak of it, I have no trouble with that.*/
@163 = ~*Sigh* I suppose one cannot leave the story unfinished. As you wish, then, my friend.~ [AARIN170]
@164 = ~NP: Callie is short for Calliara. She was an elf, like you. a woman of amazing beauty and courage. She led the thieves' guild of Neverwinter, you see, when I was just beginning my sentence. And she was the first task Lord Nasher gave me.~ [AARIN171] /*She ran the guild of thieves in Neverwinter, you see, when I first began my sentence. She was also the first task Lord Nasher set me to.*/
@165 = ~NP: Callie is short for Calliara. She was an Elf. a woman of amazing beauty and courage. She led the thieves' guild of Neverwinter, you see, when I was just beginning my sentence. And she was the first task Lord Nasher assigned me.~ [AARIN203] /*She ran the guild of thieves in Neverwinter, you see, when I first began my sentence. She was also the first task Lord Nasher set me to.*/
@166 = ~I was to see to her capture, and to reduce the power of the guild in the city... and I was eager enough to do so, though I did not know what I was up against.~ [AARIN173]
@167 = ~Don't tell me... you fell in love.~
@168 = ~So did you capture her?~
@169 = ~Sounds like one of those impossible romances.~
@170 = ~NP: Not at all. For a time, she and I were sworn enemies. Kalliara had thrown her entire guild at me, the assassins watching my every move. The thieves had grown accustomed to their power in the city and had no intention of leaving. I used every technique I knew, but in vain. Finally, I decided to disguise myself and infiltrate her guild so I could face my enemy and finish her off.~ [AARIN174] /*Not at all. For quite some time, she and I were the most dire of foes. Calliara stirred her entire guild against me, and assassins stalked my every step.*/
@171 = ~NP: Not at first. She and I became sworn enemies. Kalliara had her entire guild to fight me, the assassins watching my every move. The thieves had grown accustomed to their power in the city and had no intention of leaving. I used every technique I knew, but in vain. Finally, I decided to disguise myself and infiltrate her guild so I could face my enemy and finish her off.~ [AARIN174] /*Not at first. She and I became the most dire of foes. Calliara stirred the guild against me, and assassins stalked my every step.*/
@172 = ~NP: You're joking, though you should realize that an affair was out of the question at first. Calliara and I were sworn enemies, and she'd thrown her entire guild at me. The thieves had grown accustomed to their power in the city and had no intention of leaving. I used every technique I knew, but in vain. Finally, I decided to disguise myself and infiltrate her guild so that I could face my enemy and finish her off.~ [AARIN202] /*You joke, although you should know it was no romance at first. Calliara and I were the most dire of enemies, and she stirred her entire guild against me.*/
@173 = ~It took me a great deal of time to do so. Calliara trusted few, and I had to work my way up in the ranks over time until I was able to enter her inner circle.~ [AARIN177]
@174 = ~So you captured her then?~
@175 = ~This is a very boring story.~
@176 = ~Then allow me to end it here. You need hear no more, I am sure.~ [AARIN199]
@177 = ~No, not at all. I killed her.~ [AARIN178]
@178 = ~You killed her?~
@179 = ~NP: Yes. I should have done it much sooner, once she started trusting me enough to be alone with me..... but I was too stupid and carried away. She fascinated me. We were very much alike, and we were immediately drawn to each other. Despite my misgivings, I gave in and let myself fall in love with her.~ [AARIN179] /*Aye. I should have done it sooner, when I was first trusted enough to be alone in her presence... but I was too intrigued and foolish.*/
@180 = ~I knew it would not last. I discovered her plan to kill Lord Nasher, and knew that the time had come to tell her who I was. It was my hope to dissuade her from her life.~ [AARIN181]
@181 = ~NP: Well, of course you didn't.~ /*But of course you not do it.*/
@182 = ~How did she react?~
@183 = ~And you killed her? How could you?!~
@184 = ~NP: She didn't get angry, though I expected her to.... she just seemed disappointed when she drew her sword. It was impossible to imagine that I could pierce her with a blade. As we fought, I begged her to change her mind, to change..... to stay with me, and I would protect her from Lord Nasher's wrath. "I will not change for you, Aaryn... just as you will not change for me. Let it all end here," is what she said.~ [AARIN197] /*To strike her down was almost unthinkable. As we parried, I begged her to reconsider, to leave her life... to stay with me, and I would protect her from Lord Nasher's wrath.*/
@185 = ~NP: I almost didn't have a choice. My heart dropped, because I realized that she would never give up. She didn't get angry with me, though I expected her to..... she just seemed disappointed when she pulled out her sword. It was impossible to imagine that I could pierce her with a blade. As we fought, I begged her to change her mind, to change.... to stay with me, and I would protect her from Lord Nasher's wrath. "I will not change for you, Aaryn... just as you will not change for me. Let it all end here," is what she said.~ [AARIN198] /*I had little choice. My heart sank because I knew she would never surrender. She was not angry with me, as I thought she would be... merely disappointed as she drew her sword.*/
@186 = ~Though tears blurred my eyes, upon those words I ran her through. She died moments later, as we exchanged one... final kiss.~ [AARIN185]
@187 = ~That is very sad. I'm sorry.~
@188 = ~That's the love of your life? A woman you seduced and assassinated?~
@189 = ~I can't believe you did that. How callous and selfish!~
@190 = ~Why did you do it?~
@191 = ~NP: Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I haven't, uh. I haven't told this story to anyone yet. I'm glad I shared it with you. You're a fascinating woman yourself. I consider myself very lucky to have met you. Perhaps in time we'll get to know each other better. Like good friends. You. would you like that at all, <CHARNAME>?~ [AARIN186] /*Perhaps in time we might get to know one another better. As... as good friends. Would you... would you care at all for that, <CHARNAME>?*/
@192 = ~Certainly. I'd like that.~
@193 = ~Sorry, Aarin. I'm not interested.~
@194 = ~NP: Thank you, <CHARNAME>. I haven't, uh. I haven't told this story to anyone yet. I call few people my friends, <CHARNAME>. I would be very pleased if you were among them. Perhaps in time I'll ask you to tell your story. In the meantime, I have many other things to do.~ [AARIN191] /*There are few that I would call friend, <CHARNAME>. I would be pleased to name you amongst them.*/
@195 = ~NP: I didn't expect you to understand. I should have known better who to share my story with. Anyway, let's get back to discussing your mission. and stop talking about me for today.~ [AARIN193] /*Your original question has been answered, I hope. Let us return to the topic of your mission and... speak no more of me, today.*/
@196 = ~NP: She wouldn't leave, my friend. And she wouldn't have abandoned her plans. It was simply out of her hands, just as it was out of mine if we switched roles. And I couldn't let her win. It broke my heart, but my path was clear and destined. I must. accept it. Can you understand that, my friend?~ [AARIN195] /*She would not leave, my friend. Nor stop her plans. It was not in her to do so, just as I would not have were our roles reversed. And I could not let her succeed.*/
@197 = ~Actually, I agree with what you did... and I am sorry.~
@198 = ~No, I can't understand.~
@199 = ~NP: It's my pleasure. Of course, we have a lot of other things to do right now. Perhaps we'll talk about it some other time. Do you have any questions?~ [AARIN189] /*I am pleased. Of course, there is much else that needs to be done. Perhaps we can speak of this another time.*/
@200 = ~NP: Ð¯... I understand. Please forgive me if I seem a little too, uh. direct. Perhaps we should change the subject. Do you have any questions?~ [AARIN190] /*I... I see. Please excuse me if I seemed... forward. Perhaps it is best if we turn to another subject, then.*/
@201 = ~Do I seem uncomfortable to your eyes? I shall amend my stance, then, <CHARNAME>, for I do not wish you to feel ill at ease.~ [AARIN207]
@202 = ~But you still look uncomfortable.~
@203 = ~Go on, out with it.~
@204 = ~Ha! Actually, I like you better this way.~
@205 = ~NP: (sighs) I see, you know me too well already. Well, very well. I'll be blunt. Ð¯... I'm not used to socializing with others. I'm too used to my shadows, used to being unknown and unrecognized. But you've managed to make me see that part of my being in a new way. Ð¯... found myself worrying a great deal about you. sad when you leave and worried about your safety. I'm afraid you might not come back.~ [AARIN221] /*You, however, have forced me to re-examine that part of myself. I... find myself keenly aware of you... of your absence when you leave, and I fear for your safety... I fear that you might not return.*/
@206 = ~You needn't fear: I will always return.~
@207 = ~Don't be so foolish.~
@208 = ~You fear for me? That is sweet of you.~
@209 = ~Don't make me gag. What are you getting at?~
@210 = ~NP: Now you're laughing at me. So be it, <CHARNAME>, I will speak plainly. Ð¯... not accustomed to close contact with others. I'm too used to my shadows, used to being unknown and unrecognized. But you have managed to make me see this part of my being in a new way. Ð¯... found myself worrying a great deal about you. sad when you leave and worried about your safety. I'm afraid you might not come back.~ [AARIN222] /*You, however, have forced me to re-examine that part of myself. I... find myself keenly aware of you... of your absence when you leave, and I fear for your safety... I fear that you might not return.*/
@211 = ~I... nothing, my friend. Please... ignore that I said anything. I have clearly overstepped my bounds. Let us speak of something else.~ [AARIN220]
@212 = ~NP: Yes, because you're an amazing woman. Strong, self-sufficient, full of courage. ready to take on any man in the world. And I admire you. But I'm afraid there are dark times ahead, and we will need your courage many times over. The shadows around you may fade, and you may feel like you're alone and there's no way out.~ [AARIN211] /*Aye, for you are a marvel of a woman. Powerful, competent and full of courage... easily the equal of any man, and I admire you for it.*/
@213 = ~Take this, <CHARNAME>. It was given to me by my mother long ago, so that she knew I would always find my way out of the shadows. Take it and be reminded that there is one who prays for your safe return.~ [AARIN214]
@214 = ~Thank you, Aarin. I shall keep it safe.~
@215 = ~I... don't know what to say...~
@216 = ~No. I don't want it.~
@217 = ~NP: Yeah, I knew it would be. Now let's talk about something else. because we have a lot to do.~ [AARIN215] /*Let us speak of other things, then... for you have much to do.*/
@218 = ~NP: Then say nothing, <CHARNAME>. Accept it with the same feeling with which I give it to you. Now let's talk about something else... because we have much to do.~ [AARIN217] /*Then say nothing, <CHARNAME>. Take it in the spirit with which it is meant.*/
@219 = ~I... I see. Please forgive me, my friend. Clearly I have overstepped my bounds. Let us... speak of something else.~ [AARIN218]
@220 = ~NP: Hey, buddy, how are we doing? Is there something you wanted to ask me?~ [AARIN300] /*Well met, . Have you had any progress? Have you found Neva yet?*/
@221 = ~I understand that you have found information pinpointing the cult within Luskan. That is good... I believe I have found a way inside the city.~ [AARIN302]
@222 = ~NP: The search for a cult

Thanks to our efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved, and those residents still alive are no longer threatened by the Howling Death. However, Dester, the man who spread the plague, did not act alone. He was aided and abetted by a powerful and mysterious cult that was known only to be located somewhere north of Neverwinter.

After the long quarantine of the city was lifted and Lady Aribeth's lover, Fentic, was hanged, she moved her investigative headquarters to Port Llast, the northernmost city in the Union of Lords. An important piece of evidence was found in the case, found on the body of one of the cultists working in the area. Most likely, the cult leaders are hiding in the creepy Dark Brotherhood Master's Tower, located in the center of the pirate city of Luskan.

Aribeth insists that this theory be scrutinized and the headquarters to investigate the case be moved directly to Luskan. The chief spy, Aaryn Gend, thinks he knows a way into the city... which has been closed since the first rumors of the plague. He manages to persuade his old friend, the sergeant of Luskan's city guard, to let him and his aides through the city gates. However, Aarin Gend warns that there is no going back. No traveler who has entered Luskan will be able to get back out, so he must go there with full equipment, having finished all his current business.~ /*Through your valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be based somewhere north of Neverwinter. 
With the city's long quarantine lifted and her lover, Fenthick, hanged, Lady Aribeth has moved the base of her investigation to the township of Port Llast, northernmost member of the Lords' Alliance. An important lead has been uncovered in the case, found on the body of one of the cult agents operating in the region. The cult appears to be operating out of the dreaded Host Tower of the Arcane which lies at the heart of the pirate city of Luskan.

Aribeth intends to have this lead followed up on and wishes to move the base of operations to Luskan, itself. The Spymaster, Aarin Gend, believes he has found a way into the city... which has been sealed since news of the plague first began. He has managed to convince an old friend, a sergeant within Luskan's city guard, to allow him and his agents through the gates and into the city.

Aarin warns that this is a one-way trip, however. Once inside Luskan, nobody will be able to get back out, so one should only enter Luskan fully-equipped and with no tasks left to be completed.*/
@223 = ~NP: An old friend of mine is now guarding the city gates. I have convinced him that the plague no longer threatens the city, and he has agreed to let me and my men into the city. I'll give him your description, so he'll let you into the city. Aribeth and I will move our headquarters to Luskan and meet you there.~ [AARIN303] /*An old friend of mine is a sergeant who works the city gates. I have convinced him that the plague is no longer a threat, and as a favor he has agreed to allow my agents and I into the city.*/
@224 = ~Are you sure your friend will let me into the city?~
@225 = ~How will I get into the Host Tower?~
@226 = ~What are you and Aribeth going to do in Luskan?~
@227 = ~Me wants to talk 'bout something else.~
@228 = ~Very well.~
@229 = ~NP: Yes, I am quite sure, this is an old acquaintance of mine, we have been cooperating with him for a very long time and I have no doubt that he will fulfill his promise.~ [AARIN305] /*That is not for you to know. I cannot tell you - you would not understand what must be done.*/
@230 = ~I am not completely sure just yet. Seek me out in Luskan when you arrive and hopefully I will have a plan for you then.~ [AARIN306]
@231 = ~NP: I will, of course, try to find a way for you to sneak into the Master's Tower to give you a chance to get into the heart of the cult. Aribeth insists on going to Luskan. It seems to me she simply must be there to avenge what happened to Fentik. I can't refuse her.~ [AARIN307] /*Aribeth insists on coming to Luskan, as well. I believe she feels a strong need to see this through, to take vengeance for what happened to Fenthick. I shall not deny her.*/
@232 = ~Are you sure that's a good idea?~
@233 = ~Aribeth may seem disturbed, but it is not without reason. She takes her orders from Lord Nasher, regardless, so I am in no position to deny her will.~ [AARIN577]
@234 = ~We can speak more in Luskan, my friend. I have much to take care of before I can meet you there.~ [AARIN578]
@235 = ~NP: Aribeth and I should be working on moving our headquarters to the Temple of Tyr in Luskan. Once you get to the city, find us there. Be sure to finish all your business and bring the necessary equipment and companions before you go to Luskan. I'm not sure you'll be able to leave the city after the gates close behind you.~ [AARIN579] /*Remember to finish up any loose ends you have and to take what companions and gear you need before going to Luskan. You will not be able to leave the city once you enter.*/
@236 = ~Go, then, and do what you must. I wish you success.~ [AARIN582]
@237 = ~We will meet you in Luskan's Temple of Tyr, my friend. When you are ready, go to the city gates and the sergeant there will let you in.~ [AARIN583]
@238 = ~It is my understanding that you were of immense aid to the druid, Aawill, and indeed the entire Neverwinter Wood. Well done, my friend.~ [AARIN295]
@239 = ~A little bird has informed me that someone has actually won Mutamin's little contest. Such a person must be mighty and clever, indeed, don't you agree?~ [AARIN296]
@240 = ~Greetings, my dear friend. The presence of such a charming woman as yourself is always welcome. How may I serve?~ [AARIN298]
@241 = ~We are fortunate that you have found the location of this cult, hiding amongst the wizards of Luskan's Host Tower. It is now clear how they possess so much power and stealth.~ [AARIN060]
@242 = ~I have discovered all I can about the cult in the Host Tower.~
@243 = ~NP: I have the stamp you need.~ /*I have the seal that you need.*/
@244 = ~Where do I find this Host Tower?~
@245 = ~How do I get inside the tower?~
@246 = ~What do you know about the Arcane Brotherhood?~
@247 = ~Fine, I'll go.~
@248 = ~Well done, my friend. I knew Lord Nasher's faith in you was well-justified. Come, then... tell me what you have learned.~ [AARIN586]
@249 = ~Tell Aarin about Maugrim and Aribeth's betrayal.~
@250 = ~NP: I see. This enemy is even more secretive than I first thought, for even the very name of Maugrim is unfamiliar to me.... Nor this creature you describe as its mistress. Lady Aribeth has decided to become a Guardian of Darkness, and even lead their growing army... That's, uh. this is far worse than anything I expected. Terrible, simply terrible news.~ [AARIN587] /*I see. This enemy is far more elusive than I suspected, even, for the name of this Maugrim is unfamiliar to me... as is this creature you describe as his mistress.*/
@251 = ~But... what of this Maugrim's purpose, my friend? Were you able to discover anything of the reasoning behind all this madness?~ [AARIN589]
@252 = ~Tell Aarin about the Words of Power.~
@253 = ~NP: This is probably the first good news I've heard in a while. It shows that there's a lot we're overlooking, and we need to fix things quickly if we want to survive. But at least you've given us hope! Okay... Let's quickly return to Lord Nasher and report back to him what you've learned. And then perhaps we can decide what we should do next. Are you ready?~ [AARIN590] /*This is perhaps the first good news I have heard so far. It shows us that we are ignorant of much and must catch up quickly if we are to survive... but at least you have brought us hope.*/
@254 = ~NP: Yeah, we're leaving right now.~ /*Yes - me ready right now!*/
@255 = ~NP: The search for a cult

However, Dester, the man who spread the plague, did not act alone. He was aided and abetted by a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be located somewhere north of Neverwinter.

An important piece of evidence was found in the case, found on the body of one of the cultists working in the area. Most likely, the cult leaders are hiding in the eerie Tower of the Dark Brotherhood's Master, located in the center of the pirate city of Luskan.

The headquarters to investigate the case was moved directly to Luskan, and Aarin Gend reported that Lady Aribeth had strangely disappeared shortly after arriving on the scene. As it turned out, she had betrayed Neverwinter and decided to become a Guardian of Darkness and even lead their growing army. The head of the cult, Maugrim, is searching for powerful artifacts, the so-called Words of Power, with their help he hopes to destroy Neverwinter. Aarin Gend suggested that we return to Neverwinter as soon as possible and discuss the situation with Lord Nasher.~ /*Through your valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death.

@256 = ~NP: Wait, I still have some business to take care of in Luskana.~ /*Why you not leaves him in prison?*/
@257 = ~NP: Good work, my friend. I've already managed to forge a fake pass in the name of Ambassador Malhorand. All I have to do is transfer the seal from one document to another. like this. and it's done.~ [AARIN071] /*Excellent work, my friend. I have already managed to put together a forgery that will claim the bearer as an ambassador of Mulhorand.*/
@258 = ~NP: The search for a cult

Thanks to our efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved, and those residents still alive are no longer threatened by the Howling Death. However, Dester, the man who spread the plague, did not act alone. He was aided and abetted by a powerful and mysterious cult, known only to be located somewhere north of Neverwinter.

After the long quarantine of the city was lifted and Lady Aribeth's lover, Fentic, was hanged, she moved her investigative headquarters to Port Llast, the northernmost city in the Union of Lords. An important piece of evidence was found in the case, found on the body of one of the cultists working in the area. Most likely, the cult leaders are hiding in the creepy Dark Brotherhood Master's Tower, located in the center of the pirate city of Luskan.

The headquarters to investigate the case was moved directly to Luskan, and Aarin Gend reported that Lady Aribeth had strangely disappeared shortly after arriving on the scene. In his opinion, she may have decided to take revenge on her enemies on her own, but no time should be wasted looking for her, all adventurers should join forces in the fight against the cult.

Large detachments of guards and magical barriers will prevent uninvited visitors from crossing the bridge leading to the Master's Tower. Aarin Gend has forged all the necessary papers that will allow a small band of heroes to pass through all the barriers as important persons going to the reception in the tower.~ /*Through your valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death.

@259 = ~This forgery, then, should allow you to by-pass any guards at the bridge, as well as the magical wards. Once inside, however, I would not rely on it.~ [AARIN073]
@260 = ~NP: The tower is on an island and can be reached by a bridge from the northwest shore. They say there are other entrances... but I haven't been able to find them. The bridge is guarded by both sorcery and guards. The wizards of the Brotherhood of Mysteries value their privacy.~ [AARIN061] /*The tower lies on an island, reachable by a bridge on the northwestern shore. There are rumors of other entrances... but I have been able to find none.*/
@261 = ~NP: I think I know a way. although it's very risky, to say the least. The bridge to the tower is guarded by magic, the effects of which are not easily overcome. Those who are allowed to enter the tower are probably given passes by the wizards... papers with a magical seal that allows unhindered passage through the defenses.~ [AARIN067] /*I believe I know of a way... though it is a risky path, to say the least. The bridge to the tower's island is guarded by magic that is not easily by-passed.*/

A heavy contingent of guards and magical wards prevent unwanted visitors from crossing the bridge to the Host Tower. Aarin Gend believes he might be able to forge the necessary documents to pass a small group of adventurers off as visiting dignitaries, however. Doing so will require the official pass of one of Luskan's High Captains, the city's self-proclaimed pirate kings constantly squabbling over goods and territory within the city walls. The pass has the magical seal of the Arcane Brotherhood, which Aarin Gend hopes to use to make a forgery.~
@263 = ~NP: Unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge, only the High Captains have such passes. If you can get me one of these stamped documents, I'll use it, and I can easily make one for you as well.~ [AARIN069] /*If you were somehow to acquire one of these documents for me, with its seal, I could easily use it to forge a similar pass for you.*/
@264 = ~NP: Almost nothing, to be honest. Wizards search for spies thoroughly and everywhere, so I have only dubious information coming from outside the tower. However, it is common knowledge that the Brotherhood of Mysteries actually rules Luskan. The High Captains can only rule as much as the wizards allow them to. We can only wonder how the cult managed to settle there. Perhaps the Wizards are in league with them. or, worse, are sectarians themselves.~ [AARIN063] /*Little enough, if the truth be told. The wizards search diligently for spies at every turn, so I receive only questionable news from outside the tower itself.*/
@265 = ~If you do gain entrance, use extreme caution and find out all you can about their plans. Assaulting them directly may not be an option.~ [AARIN066]
@266 = ~I shall pray for your success, my dear friend. Be safe, for I could not bear your loss.~ [AARIN225]
@267 = ~It... is good to see you at last, my friend. I fear I have terrible news. It seems that the good lady Aribeth... has disappeared. We can find no trace of her.~ [AARIN050]
@268 = ~What?! What happened?~
@269 = ~Do you have any idea where she might be?~
@270 = ~So what? What do I care?~
@271 = ~I shall try to find her, if I can.~
@272 = ~NP: Lady Paladine has been very quiet since you left Port Llast. I thought she'd calm down a bit now that the sectarian base has been discovered. So I didn't follow her as closely as I usually do. Lo and behold, she disappeared without a trace shortly after we arrived in the city. Her armor and weapons were also missing. She was well prepared and left of her own free will, though I find that hard to believe.~ [AARIN051] /*The lady paladin had been quite silent since you left Port Llast. I thought perhaps that she had found contentment now that the cult was located.*/
@273 = ~NP: She didn't go back to Neverwinter. And something tells me that she, uh. maybe she's decided to take her own revenge on the cultists. But I can't be sure. Aribeth was acting very strangely before she disappeared. She seemed perfectly calm, as if she had resigned herself to her unfortunate fate. I'm very worried about her. I'm afraid she's lost her mind.~ [AARIN054] /*I cannot be certain. Aribeth was acting so strangely before her disappearance. She had an icy calm, as if the lady paladin had accepted an unpleasant fate.*/
@274 = ~As you wish. I am concerned for the lady paladin, even if you are not. I thought at the least you should know.~ [AARIN057]
@275 = ~NP: Your most important task is to infiltrate the Master's Tower, my friend. This sect must be ended. If you find Aribet there, so much the better. If she's not in the tower, the real search can only be undertaken once you've accomplished your primary objective, as much as we'd like to think otherwise. So, uh. let's discuss the task at hand.~ [AARIN058] /*If she is not within the Host Tower, a true search will have to wait until after your own mission is complete, no matter how much we might wish otherwise. So, then... let us discuss your mission.*/
@276 = ~NP: So, are you ready to go to Lord Nasher in Neverwinter?~ /*100 gold... will that get you to Neverwinter?*/
@277 = ~NP: No, I'm not ready yet.~ /*No, I don't want it.*/
@278 = ~NP: The search for a cult

Thanks to our efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved, and the surviving inhabitants are no longer threatened by the Howling Death. However, Dester, the man who spread the plague, did not act alone. He was aided and abetted by a powerful and mysterious cult known only to be located somewhere north of Neverwinter. Lady Aribeth has moved her investigative headquarters to a settlement in Port Llast, that town being the northernmost member of the Union of Lords. She is waiting for us in that town.~ /*A cult agent named Ganon has been found and defeated in the ogre caves north of Port Llast. The journal found nearby does not say where the cult is located but it does suggest that other cultists have been sent to Charwood in the south and Neverwinter Wood in the east to search for some sort of important object. These two locations would seem to be likely places to continue the search.*/
@279 = ~Through your valiant efforts, the city of Neverwinter has been saved and what citizens it still has have been spared the suffering of the Wailing Death. Desther, the man responsible for spreading the plague, did not act alone, however. He had substantial backing from a powerful and mysterious cult, which was tracked down with considerable effort to be based within the Host Tower of the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan.
The leader of the cult, a sorcerer by the name of Maugrim, had engineered a coup to overthrow the order of wizards and bring the majority of its power under the influence of the cult. This power was used to approach other powers in the North and throw the city of Luskan into chaos... all in an effort to build an army that could assault Neverwinter. This army will be led by none other than Lady Aribeth herself... a fallen paladin who has become a blackguard in the service of the same mistress as Maugrim: a strange lizard creature by the name of Morag.

This Morag seeks 'Words of Power'... what they are or what will happen once Morag obtains them is unknown, but they may prove to be the only way to block the great power Maugrim and his cult have already gathered.

Time is of the essence. You must bring this information quickly to Aarin Gend at the Temple of Tyr!~
