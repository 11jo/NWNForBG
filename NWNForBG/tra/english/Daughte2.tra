@0 = ~Another day, another adventurer. You don't look as tough as some of them have looked, though.~
@1 = ~Could you answer a few questions for me?~
@2 = ~Do you get a lot of adventurers in town?~
@3 = ~NP: All right, I gotta go.~ /*It's time for me to leave.*/
@4 = ~Very well... and what might they be?~
@5 = ~So what's been happening around town lately?~
@6 = ~So what's a girl like you doing in a town like this?~
@7 = ~Could you help me find a few places?~
@8 = ~Me look for certain people.~
@9 = ~Fine, me go then.~
@10 = ~Everything's been different since Karathis took Urth and the other boys away. Nothing feels safe here anymore.~
@11 = ~Who's Karathis?~
@12 = ~Kara-dis? Who he?~
@13 = ~NP: He was so handsome, all the girls here were in love with him! He said he was a werewolf hunter and took the boys hunting with him. The only one who came back was Ender. If you want to hear his story, look for him in The Union Crest.~ /*He was so handsome, all of us girls were so in love with him! He said he was a werewolf hunter and he took the boys out on a raid.*/
@14 = ~Oh, sometimes I dream of going places. Most of us girls have spent a night or two at Wanev's just to see what it's like...~
@15 = ~Who's Wanev and where does he live?~
@16 = ~Wanev? Who he? Where he at?~
@17 = ~NP: He's a nasty little wizard, he has a cottage here in town. He's always trying to invite the local girls over to his house. We all laugh at him behind his back, but we still go to his cottage. He has a tower somewhere on the way to Charwood, but I've never been there.~ /*He's a disgusting little wizard who keeps a cottage here in town. He's always trying to convince us local girls to visit.*/
@18 = ~What are you looking for?~
@19 = ~Where can I find an inn?~
@20 = ~Where can I find a store around here for magical or regular supplies?~
@21 = ~I have other questions.~
@22 = ~Okays, me go.~
@23 = ~The Alliance Arms, up at the north reach, is the only inn in town. The ale's no good but the conversation's always good... Ma doesn't like it when I go there.~
@24 = ~I have some other questions.~
@25 = ~NP: "A friend of my dad's, Halial, runs the Cracked Anvil, it's downtown. I don't know much about gear, but he's bound to have what you're looking for.~ /*My pa's friend, Haljal, runs the Cracked Anvil between the crossroads and the river. I don't know much about adventuring stuff but I'm sure he'd have what you need.*/
@26 = ~Who are you looking for?~
@27 = ~Does Port Llast have a ranger or druid I could speak with?~
@28 = ~NP: Do you know where I can find a priest?~ /*Know where I can find a priest?*/
@29 = ~There's Ballard. He's in the grove to the northeast. He says the birds sing songs about me sometimes.~
@30 = ~Sure. Neurik runs the temple at the crossroads and he's really nice... I like it that your Lady Aribeth is here now, too, all tough and graceful and the like.~
@31 = ~Bye bye.~
@32 = ~NP: Ah, this epidemic in Neverwinter. All the sick and scared people moving here. I don't like it. People stink. No offense. Shaldrissa's probably the only one who likes people like you. She thinks you're all gonna take her away from here. If it'll shut her up, I'd like to see it happen soon.~ /*Shaldrissa is probably the only one that likes your type, anyway. She thinks you're all going to take her away. If it would shut her up, I wish it would happen.*/
@33 = ~Who's Shaldrissa?~
@34 = ~NP: It's just a girl who can't be happy where she is. But someday her wish will come true. She will wake up with dirt in her hair and horrible smelling clothes, and then she will return to Port Llast in tears.~ /*She's just some girl that can't be happy with where she is now. But one day she'll get her wish.*/
@35 = ~And why would I tell you? Why not go find her and talk to her yourself. She's around somewhere. I'm sure she'll be oh-so-excited.~
@36 = ~Hmn. You definitely don't look as tough as some of the other adventurers that have come through here. What do you want?~
@37 = ~You, on the other hand, look tougher than any of the adventurers that have been through here so far. Or at least nicer. Not that I care.~
