@0 = ~I don't know why you've barged into my room, but whoever you are: I'm not entertaining today. I'm required to go... elsewhere.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~You don't seem happy about that.~
@3 = ~NP: Can I ask you a question?~ /*Can I ask you a question?*/
@4 = ~NP: What does that mean, "somewhere else"?~ /*What you means 'elsewhere?'*/
@5 = ~Bela told me to see you.~
@6 = ~Goodbye.~
@7 = ~My name is Oreth. While I am one of Miss Bela's courtesans, I don't work here anymore... thanks to those damned High Captains.~
@8 = ~Hmph. I'd just as soon see the High Captains both dead and in the gutter rather than cater to those sick bastards. I have to do what I'm told, though, and smile about it.~
@9 = ~Why do anything for them, if you don't want to?~
@10 = ~Just what is it you do for them?~
@11 = ~Maybe you can answer some questions on the High Captains.~
@12 = ~Perhaps I can help you.~
@13 = ~No you can't. I'm not really in the mood for chit-chat. I don't suppose you'd mind just leaving me be?~
@14 = ~I mean not here, where I should be. I mean wherever those damnable High Captains want me to go, that's where.~
@15 = ~She did? Why would she do that?~
@16 = ~NP: Why do you think she sent me to you?~ /*Why do you think she'd send me to you?*/
@17 = ~I said I thought the High Captains should be stopped.~
@18 = ~We were discussing the High Captains.~
@19 = ~NP: Okay, forget it.~ /*"Forget I asked..."*/
@20 = ~Aye, I'm sure you can see yourself out.~
@21 = ~I really shouldn't even be discussing Kurth and Baram. That's a sure way to trouble. So, if you don't mind...?~
@22 = ~I won't tell anyone what you say.~
@23 = ~A surer way to trouble is not to answer my questions... get it?~
@24 = ~I could pay you for the information, if you like.~
@25 = ~Nevermind, then.~
@26 = ~And why do you need to know, exactly, huh?~
@27 = ~I want to know more about these High Captains.~
@28 = ~Just answer the question.~
@29 = ~I'm supposed to read her mind, am I? Maybe she thinks you have something against Kurth or Baram, I don't know.~
@30 = ~I suppose it really doesn't matter. Fine, fine, I'll tell you what I know. The High Captains hold an axe over Miss Bela's head, forcing her to do what they wish or close her down... close us all down. That means that I have to go to Baram or Kurth... whichever decides he has a use for me... and do whatever they wish.~ /*The High Captains hold an axe over Miss Bela's head, forcing her to do what they wish or close her down... close us all down.*/
@31 = ~And I'm supposed to believe that? How gullible do you think I am?~
@32 = ~Oh, that's rich. Now you're threatening me? Ahhhh, what do I care? Have it your way. I'll tell you what I know. The High Captains hold an axe over Miss Bela's head, forcing her to do what they wish or close her down... close us all down. That means that I have to go to Baram or Kurth... whichever decides he has a use for me... and do whatever they wish.~ /*The High Captains hold an axe over Miss Bela's head, forcing her to do what they wish or close her down... close us all down.*/
@33 = ~Pay me? I've got more than enough coin, I'm sure. Ahhhh, I suppose it makes no difference. I'll tell you what I know. The High Captains hold an axe over Miss Bela's head, forcing her to do what they wish or close her down... close us all down. That means that I have to go to Baram or Kurth... whichever decides he has a use for me... and do whatever they wish.~ /*The High Captains hold an axe over Miss Bela's head, forcing her to do what they wish or close her down... close us all down.*/
@34 = ~I have more than enough gold, miss. Frankly, I've had more than enough of you, as well. Get out of my room and leave me alone.~
@35 = ~I'm glad to help Bela, but those men... I wish someone would do something nasty to those men. If I were braver, I'd try to kill the High Captains myself. That would only get me killed and Miss Bela in trouble, though.~
@36 = ~And if someone were willing to help you... ?~
@37 = ~Just what do they make you do?~
@38 = ~Can you tell me about the High Captains?~
@39 = ~So you is weak. That not news.~
@40 = ~Then I'd say I might be able to help them. I know the back routes into both of the High Captains' bases.~
@41 = ~How do I find Kurth, then?~
@42 = ~How do I find Baram, then?~
@43 = ~Naw. Forgets it.~
@44 = ~Put on a show for them with one of the other girls here, Rhaine. Or worse... I'd really rather not discuss it.~
@45 = ~Who is this Rhaine you mention?~
@46 = ~I suppose I know plenty about Kurth and Baram. What do you want to know?~
@47 = ~Where do I find Kurth?~
@48 = ~Where can I find Baram?~
@49 = ~Tell me about Kurth.~
@50 = ~Tell me about Baram.~
@51 = ~Can they be reasoned with?~
@52 = ~Get out of my room. I don't need your kind of company.~
@53 = ~Kurth is in the West Docks district. His men come out of a gap broken in the wall. I don't suggest that you use that. There is an opening in the ruins of his old tower. It's what I use when I must go and see him.~
@54 = ~NP: Baram has a base in the city's sewers, and it's full of his squads and undead that his warlock allies summon for him. The main entrance is a hole in the sewer north of here. His base is heavily defended, but by no means impregnable. There's a back door that few people know about...~ /*Baram has a base within the sewers of the city, full of his troops and undead monsters conjured by his sorcerer allies. The main gate is through a sewer entrance on the island east of and south of here.*/
@55 = ~Then I suppose there's nothing more to say, is there?~
@56 = ~Like I said, she's one of Bela's other girls... she's at Baram's beck and call just like me. She has her own room here if you want to talk to her.~
@57 = ~He's a madman. He's always been hungry for power, they say, but even his men think he's gone completely mad, now. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants. All he thinks about is killing Baram and taking over the city, talking about how glorious it will be. I don't believe he actually even thinks about what this all has done to Luskan.~ /*He's a madman. He's always been hungry for power, they say, but even his men think he's gone completely mad, now. He will stop at nothing to get what he wants.*/
@58 = ~Baram is... a cunning man. He relies on guile more than strength, and doesn't consider any act too low or desperate to perform. He's allied with necromancers... there's undead all about his base, making his men nervous and jittery. Even Baram, himself, seems strange... I think he's done something to himself. Something unnatural.~ /*He's allied with necromancers... there's undead all about his base, making his men nervous and jittery. Even Baram, himself, seems strange... I think he's done something to himself. Something unnatural.*/
@59 = ~Maybe. You might be able to talk to them, if they thought you could help them kill the other High Captain. I doubt they'd keep any deal you made, though.~
@60 = ~NP: Baram has a base in the city's sewers, and it's full of his squads and undead that his warlock allies summon for him. The main entrance is a hole in the sewer north of here. His base is heavily defended, but by no means impregnable. There's a back door that few people know about... I have a key you could use to get in. if you wish.~ /*Baram has a base within the sewers of the city, full of his troops and undead monsters conjured by his sorcerer allies. The main gate is through a sewer entrance on the island east of and south of here.*/
@61 = ~That's all I can tell you about that, however.~
@62 = ~NP: Kurt's holed up in the west dock area. His men are coming out of a breach in the wall. I wouldn't advise you to go that way. There's a passageway near the ruins of his old tower. I use it when I go to see him.  You need a key to get into his base through the door in the tower. You need a key to get to Baram too, take the keys if you want. I don't know what your plans are, but those bastards sure don't like them!~ /*Kurth is in the West Docks district. His men come out of a gap broken in the wall. I don't suggest that you use that. There is an opening in the ruins of his old tower. It's what I use when I must go and see him.*/
@63 = ~Yes, give me the key.~
@64 = ~NP: No, I don't want any keys.~ /*No, I don't need any key.*/
@65 = ~NP: You need a key to get into Kurt's base through the door in the tower, too. Take it if you want it. I don't know what your plans are, but those bastards won't like them!~ /*You need a key to get into his base through the tower door. You can have it, if you wish. I don't know what you're plans are, but I bet you that bastard won't like them.*/
@66 = ~Here... this should unlock the gratings there for you. It's well-watched, though, and using this key will ensure Baram thinks you're an enemy. I don't presume to know your business, but kill that little rat if you can. I'll be happy to know it when his days are at an end.~ /*Here... this should unlock the gratings there for you. It's well-watched, though, and using this key will ensure Baram thinks you're an enemy.*/
@67 = ~NP: And this is a copy of the key to Kurt's lair, but be careful... If Kurt's guards see you enter, they'll assume you're an enemy and try to kill you. Kurt deserves to die, my friend... If you get the chance, kill him without hesitation. The people of Luskan and I will be grateful for it.~ /*Kurth deserves to die, friend... if you get the chance, don't hesitate. More Luskanites than I will thank you dearly for it.*/
@68 = ~NP: Suit yourself. Now leave me alone.~ /*Aye, then, off ye go an' leave me be.*/
@69 = ~Back again? Look, I've already told you what I have to do... what do you want from me?~
@70 = ~Can you answer some questions about the High Captains?~
@71 = ~I was hoping to hire you.~
@72 = ~I thought you should know: Baram is dead.~
@73 = ~I thought you should know: Kurth is dead.~
@74 = ~Hmph. You girls are all alike... you can't hear for all the talking. I said I wasn't working, remember? Now get out of my room and don't come back.~
@75 = ~Well that's a relief. Baram was almost worse than Kurth with his twisted little brain. I suppose you did the job? Of course you did, or you wouldn't know. Thank you for that, at least. You've done the city a favor. I don't suppose you might have gotten rid of Kurth while you were at it?~ /*Well that's a relief. Baram was almost worse than Kurth with his twisted little brain. I suppose you did the job? Of course you did, or you wouldn't know.*/
@76 = ~Yes, actually. He's dead too.~
@77 = ~No.~
@78 = ~He is, is he? Well, that's good. That smug bastard deserves to suffer... I hope he was squealing for mercy in the end. I suppose I should thank you for getting rid of him. I don't suppose you might have gotten rid of Baram while you were at it?~ /*I suppose I should thank you for getting rid of him. I don't suppose you might have gotten rid of Baram while you were at it?*/
@79 = ~What? You... you're joking, right? No, you're not joking... I can see it in your face. That's wonderful news! Thank you, thank you! Finally I'm not under the thumb of either of those bastards! I wish I could give you some kind of reward! You've done us all a huge favor! May the gods bless you, my <LADYLORD>!~ /*No, you're not joking... I can see it in your face. That's wonderful news! Thank you, thank you! Finally I'm not under the thumb of either of those bastards!*/
@80 = ~Oh, well. I suppose things won't really change, then, once he discovers he's the only High Captain left... if he actually is. You can never tell. But thank you anyhow.~
@81 = ~Back again? I've given you a key. I hope you'll use it to kill the High Captains... or whatever it is you have planned. What else do you want?~
@82 = ~Somehow I think you've got the wrong room, sir. Please leave me be.~
@83 = ~I have some questions for you.~
@84 = ~My name is Oreth, one of Miss Bela's male courtesans. I'm not working today... so I ask you again to leave me be.~
@85 = ~Why aren't you working?~
@86 = ~I'm not interested in any of your questions. I asked you to leave me be... now please get out. Miss Bela has enough girls to keep you entertained, I'm sure.~
@87 = ~Somehow I think you've got the wrong room, sir. Please leave me be.~
@88 = ~NP: I don't want to answer any questions. I'm asking you to leave me alone. Please go away.~ /*I'm not answering any of your questions until you answer mine.*/
@89 = ~I'm sorry, but I really must go!~
