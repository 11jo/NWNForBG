@0 = ~Leave my face alone you horrible... oh, wait, you're not that ghastly hag.~
@1 = ~No I'm not. I'm <CHARNAME>. And who are you?~
@2 = ~No I'm not. Who are you?~ 
@3 = ~You noticed? Why don't you run along now, before the witch comes back.~
@4 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@5 = ~My name is Bree. Besides being the most beautiful druid in the Neverwinter Wood, I am also one of the druids who was investigating the problems with the Wood's Spirit.~
@6 = ~Why don't you tell me what happened to you?~
@7 = ~What are you doing here in the witch's house?~
@8 = ~What did you discover about the Spirit?~
@9 = ~Other druids have disappeared too. Do you know where they are?~ 
@10 = ~Wait, before you go, did Aawill send you?~
@11 = ~He sent me to rescue some druids. Are you one of them?~
@12 = ~I have met someone named Aawill. How do you know him?~
@13 = ~Oh, please don't be long. I must get away from here soon.~
@14 = ~I was wandering through the forest, dodging encounters with the normal inhabitants. There was no point in even trying to speak with the animals; they were almost rabid with fear and anger. Then I thought of the witch.~
@15 = ~Why would you seek the witch?~
@16 = ~That certainly turned out to be a brilliant decision.~
@17 = ~It's gone insane! The whole forest is caught up in its insanity, and if someone doesn't stop it soon I fear the creatures will start tearing each other apart. The Spirit is normally peaceful and comes into the Wood through its pool to tend to the creatures. Since the violence began, the Spirit hasn't come through at all. If it had, I would have tried to talk to it.~ 
@18 = ~Tell me more about this pool.~
@19 = ~How do you think the Spirit would have reacted to you?~
@20 = ~I don't know where the little one went, Orlane's his name, but I know that the pretty elf, Terari, was going to try his charms on the nymphs. You could go ask him. They might know where he went. Of course they might have gone as crazy as the rest of the forest, so you might want to be careful what you say.~ 
@21 = ~So how did you get down here?~
@22 = ~Do you need help escaping, or can you make it on your own?~
@23 = ~Wonderful Aawill! Thank goodness for his wisdom.~
@24 = ~He is the head of our druidic circle.~
@25 = ~The animals have always held the witch in high esteem. She protects and helps them quite often. I figured that the Spirit probably wouldn't have any control over her mind, so perhaps she would be a source of information.~
@26 = ~I found the witch in a clearing near here. She was harvesting some herbs at the time, so I came out quietly and waited for her to notice me. She worked for a while, then turned and smiled at me. Her eyes remained fixed on my face for a long time.~
@27 = ~Did she recognize you or something?~
@28 = ~Why would she stare at your face?~
@29 = ~How could I possibly have anticipated her reaction to seeing how incredibly beautiful I am?~
@30 = ~The pool is some kind of entrance to another realm where the Spirit usually lives. I haven't the slightest idea what the other realm looks like though.~
@31 = ~Why didn't you go into it?~
@32 = ~What do you mean another realm?~
@33 = ~I don't know what it would have done. It might have attacked me, but I would have tried anyways. It is the source of the problem.~
@34 = ~I can make it on my own. I will meet up with you at the druid grove. Carry the image of my beautiful face in your mind, for good luck. Farewell.~ 
@35 = ~She just seemed to admire my looks. No surprise really, since she certainly has none. She convinced me to enter her house, and we sat down to have tea. We talked a little, but then I started to get dizzy and I realized there was something in my tea. Next thing I knew I was locked in this room. The witch came in and muttered something about stealing my face. I don't know what she meant by that, although if I had her face I'd want a different one too.~ 
@36 = ~Are you blind? My radiant beauty stunned her, the poor thing.~
@37 = ~Now that you have freed me, I will return to the grove and consult with the other druids about the Spirit of the Wood.~
@38 = ~I had to kill the Spirit of the Wood, so you don't have to worry about it now.~
@39 = ~I cured the Spirit of the Wood, so you can rest easy now.~
@40 = ~Tell me what you've learned about the Spirit of the Wood.~
@41 = ~Do you know what happened to the other druids?~
@42 = ~I don't know much about the pool, mostly just stories. I do know that no living creature can get through the portal and into the other realm. I think Orlane told me something about how the portal exists between the realms of life and death. The Spirit exists as some sort of half-life, so it can go back and forth through the portal, but we can't.~ 
@43 = ~Do you have any suggestions of what I should do?~
@44 = ~It's another plane of existence. The pool acts as a portal to this other place.~
@45 = ~It's dead? Oh, I was afraid that something like that would have to be done. The other druids didn't want to admit it, but nobody knew how to stop the Spirit. It was only a matter of time before someone would realize that it had to die.~ 
@46 = ~So, you're not mad at me?~
@47 = ~I'm glad you see it my way.~
@48 = ~You... you cured it? I must admit that I am shocked. You are quite the <MANWOMAN>, to have accomplished such a deed. You really are a hero, even if you're not as beautiful as I am.~ 
@49 = ~I must be going now. Take care, and thank you for all your help.~
@50 = ~Somehow you need to find a way through the portal, then you need to either cure the Spirit or, and I hate to say this, you need to kill it. Most druids wouldn't even suggest something like that, but you do what you have to. Don't ask me how you can do any of those things, because I don't know. I know I am both highly beautiful and intelligent, but I simply don't have the answers.~ 
@51 = ~Sometimes the only way to solve a problem is to make the unpopular choice. Don't worry about what anybody else says, you did what you had to do. I must be going now. Take care, and thank you for all your help.~ 
@52 = ~I'm so glad you're back. I was starting to worry. Can I leave yet?~
@53 = ~Why don't you tell me your story?~
@54 = ~You just wait here. I'll be back.~
@55 = ~I'm still beautiful, thanks to you. You have my eternal gratitude.~
