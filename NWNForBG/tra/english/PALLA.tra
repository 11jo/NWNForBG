@0 = ~Why have you come to seek the council of this old woman?~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~Neurik sent me. I am representing Rolgan in the upcoming trial.~
@3 = ~May I ask you some questions?~
@4 = ~I'll be going now.~
@5 = ~I am Palla of the Black Lion tribe. I offer the wisdom of age to the Uthgardt who seek it.~
@6 = ~The life of one of my people is in your hands. I will aid you as best I can, though there is little I can do. The ways of justice among the Lords' Alliance are unknown to me.~
@7 = ~How do you feel about this case?~
@8 = ~NP: Unfortunately, the council of elders only exists for those who belong to the Black Lion tribe. My wisdom will only help those who live as Utgardt, and you... you are not an Utgardt. I know nothing of your kind. I cannot give you advice. Go, the Black Lion tribe blesses you. It's the only thing I can give you.~ /*Unfortunately, the council of elders is reserved for those of the Black Lion tribe. My wisdom is only in the Uthgardt way of life and you... are not Uthgardt.*/
@9 = ~Go with the blessing of the Black Lion tribe.~
@10 = ~I am very disappointed in Rolgan. Our tribe constantly struggles against the stereotype of the drunken savage, yet Rolgan allowed himself to fall under the influence of alcohol. This is the result.~
@11 = ~Sounds like you already think he's guilty.~
@12 = ~Is there some way I can guarantee you will return a verdict of not guilty?~
@13 = ~NP: We'll see. Rolgan is a symbol of our people, and I pray he is not guilty of what he is accused of. But my duty in this trial is clear: Newrick explained to me all about the oath the jury takes. If there is evidence that Rolgan allowed alcohol to cloud his judgment and that is the only reason he killed the man, I must find him guilty. This trial is not conducted according to the customs of our tribe, but I must follow the rules of Newrick.~ /*If the evidence shows Rolgan let alcohol cloud his mind so that he killed that man without reason, I must return a verdict of guilty. This trial is not the way of our tribe, but I must follow Neurik's rules in this matter.*/
@14 = ~If the evidence shows Rolgan let alcohol cloud his mind so that he killed that man without reason, I must return a verdict of guilty. This trial is not the way of our tribe, but I must follow Neurik's rules in this matter.~
@15 = ~We Uthgardt cannot risk the wrath of the Lords' Alliance by defying the High Priest of Tyr. I pray Rolgan is not a sacrifice for the good of the entire tribe, but if it must be it must be.~
@16 = ~Rolgan owes you his life, <CHARNAME>. You have earned much honor in defending him. We children of the Black Lion thank you for what you have done.~
@17 = ~Rolgan's spirit haunts me for the judgment I have passed - just as he will haunt you for breaking your vow to defend him! Begone, Oathbreaker!~
