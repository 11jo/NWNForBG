@0 = ~What do you want? You here about the trial?~
@1 = ~NP: Court? What trial?~ /*Where is your husband?*/
@2 = ~Neurik sent me. I'm representing Rolgan.~
@3 = ~I'll be going now.~
@4 = ~Come on, everybody's heard about it! Some Uthgardt is up for the murder of a Lords' Alliance soldier. Go speak to Neurik in the Temple of Tyr; he can fill you in.~
@5 = ~I figured as much. I ain't never been on a jury before. I seen my share of trials, but usually from the prisoner's box. What do you want to know?~
@6 = ~I'm preparing my case. What do you think about this trial?~
@7 = ~See ya.~
@8 = ~NP: I think a regular bar fight just got out of hand. When you drink too much, you start acting like a total asshole. I know that myself, even though I've never killed anyone. But you know what pisses me off about this case? People who say the only reason this guy's on trial is because he's an Utgardt! I'm not an Utgardt, and they can't count my hits!~ /*Looks to me like a bar fight gone out of hand. A few too many drinks in you and you act stupid. I've been there myself, though I ain't never killed no one.*/
@9 = ~Sounds like you're trying to keep an open mind.~
@10 = ~Is there any way I could guarantee you find Rolgan innocent?~
@11 = ~NP: I know how it is. Sometimes you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Maybe that's what happened with this Utgardt. I even hope you can get this guy off. I'd hate to put the poor guy on death row. But I need an objective verdict. Newrick says it's my duty.~ /*I kind of hope you get him off. I'd hate to have to sentence the poor guy to execution. But I've got to give an honest verdict. Neurik says it's my duty.*/
@12 = ~You mean like a bribe? Geez, I don't know. I could use the money, but what if Neurik found out?~
@13 = ~He'll never know. Here's 300 gold. Just make sure you find Rolgan innocent.~
@14 = ~Hey, I was just testing you. You passed. Well done.~
@15 = ~Not much more I can tell you. Hope you got what you were looking for. Good luck in the trial.~
@16 = ~NP: Okay, here's the deal. I'll vote for Rolgan's innocence, but I can't convince the rest of the jury. I'll keep my end of the bargain, but you'll have to make the rest. I don't think you and I should talk until after the trial, okay? We don't want people wondering what we're up to and guessing about this bribe. Why don't you leave before anyone asks questions?~ /*I guess we probably shouldn't talk to each other until after the trial, right? We don't want people to wonder what we're up to with this bribe and all. You better go before someone starts asking questions.*/
@17 = ~NP: No, I don't think we should. What if Newrick finds out? He'll have me flogged! Or worse! He said it's my duty to pass a fair sentence. Don't worry, I don't want to set anyone up. I won't tell anyone about this, but if you want my vote, you'll have to earn it in court.~ /*No, I better not. What if Neurik found out? He'd have me flogged! Or worse! He said it's my duty to deliver an honest verdict.*/
@18 = ~NP: Ugh! I almost agreed to take that money, you know? I don't want to think about what Newrick could do to me. You tell him I did the right thing, okay? I don't think there's anything else I can tell you. I hope you get what you're looking for. Good luck in court.~ /*Whew! I almost took that money, you know? I hate to think what Neurik would have done. You tell him I did the right thing, okay?*/
@19 = ~Wh- what do you want? You shouldn't be here - you'll get us both in trouble! Just... just do me a favor and leave me alone until after the trial.~
@20 = ~Don't worry, I won't go back on our deal. I'll vote to find Rolgan innocent. Just don't talk to me anymore until after the trial.~
@21 = ~I'm sure glad Rolgan's trial is over. I ain't never been on a jury before. It's almost as hard as being in the prisoner box!~
@22 = ~Too bad he ended up getting executed. Makes me sick to see his remains stuck out there on that stake in front of the Temple. But Neurik said it ain't my fault. We jurors were just doing our duty.~
@23 = ~I'm glad the Uthgardt got off. At least now I don't have to walk past his head on a spike every time I go by the Temple of Tyr. I don't know if I could have handled that.~
