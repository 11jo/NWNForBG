@0 = ~You'll have to wait forever if ye're looking for a turn... if you haven't noticed, Bela's is packed.~
@1 = ~You know, I hear that Kurth and Baram own this place. Took it over.~
@2 = ~One of the girls told me High Captain Baram has one of Bela's courtesans all to himself. She visits with him every night!~
@3 = ~Be careful downstairs. A fight'll break out soon and burn the place down... just you watch.~
@4 = ~Hmmm... I wonder how much that Miss Bela'd charge for a night?~
@5 = ~Most of us here play a little diamondback while we wait for our turn. Care to join us?~
@6 = ~Blast it! Lost most of my money in diamondback... can't even afford to stay, now.~
@7 = ~Nice place to come and forget about all the fighting for a while.~
@8 = ~I hear High Captain Kurth has closed off the West Harbor district. No way out of Luskan, now.~
@9 = ~They say Baram's down in the sewers... but I know for a fact that the place is full of monsters, so that can't be true.~
@10 = ~Don't let the guards catch you in the streets. If they don't know you, they'll kill you.~
@11 = ~One of the girls here got pregnant, I hear. Bela's got almost no girls who are working.~
@12 = ~Sorry... I'm a bit busy at the moment. No time to chat.~
