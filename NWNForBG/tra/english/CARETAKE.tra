@0 = ~MT: Eh? What's the matter? Who's disturbing my graveyard here? Is it that one of my dead men came to me, will he be wandering around here now?~ /*Eh? What's this? Are you one of my dead come back to haunt me in my graveyard?*/
@1 = ~MT: Your graveyard? It is not noticeable that your name is written on it.~ /**Your* graveyard? Me not sees you name on it.*/
@2 = ~Who are you?~
@3 = ~What do you do around here?~
@4 = ~I'm going now.~
@5 = ~Yes, *my* graveyard, damn it. You think these old headstones just clean themselves, do you? Ha!~
@6 = ~It's a rather small graveyard, isn't it?~
@7 = ~I take care of all these old stones, dear <PRO_MANWOMAN>. Keep them nice and shiny for the visitors, oh yes. 'Tis my job, you see.~
@8 = ~Are there many visitors, then?~
@9 = ~Yes, well... be careful where you walk around here. Hmph.~
@10 = ~Well, they moved the graveyard inside the city walls, smarty-pants. Nobody comes out here anymore, not that I mind.~
@11 = ~Well... no, not really. Not since they moved the graveyard inside the city walls. As if *anyone* would want to be buried out here where the graverobbers could strip you of your last possessions.~
@12 = ~Oh! But if only they knew! Hee hee! My little graveyard has its secrets, oh yes it does!~
@13 = ~Er... you're a loon, you know that?~
@14 = ~And just what sorts or secrets are you talking about?~
@15 = ~You think so, do you? It so happens that they buried one of the oldest members of the Arcane Brotherhood right here, they did.~
@16 = ~What is Arcane Brotherhood?~
@17 = ~Oh? And what's interesting about that?~
@18 = ~Where did they bury him?~
@19 = ~Well... all right, then, listen close. They buried one of the oldest members of the Arcane Brotherhood here. Right here, oh yes.~
@20 = ~MT: What?! You do not know?! In the name of Garl Glittergold's sparkling ass, what kind of adventurers are these? The Brotherhood of the Sacred is the greatest order of wizards in Luskan, they occupy the highest tower in the city! They rule Luskan... but it's a secret, so don't talk about it.~ /*The Arcane Brotherhood is Luskan's great order of wizards, holed up in the tallest tower in the city! They control Luskan... but that's a secret, so shush.*/
@21 = ~So what's so interesting about one of them being buried here?~
@22 = ~MT: So where did they bury this wizard?~ /*So where did they bury this wizard?*/
@23 = ~MT: It's very interesting because they carved a whole crypt into the stone wall! And it's full of magical stuff... at least that's what I've been told.~ /*This is very interesting because they carved out a whole tomb underneath the mausoleum! Full of magics and everything... or so I'm told.*/
@24 = ~You haven't gone down there?~
@25 = ~MT: They carved an entire crypt into the stone wall! My dad told me that the Brotherhood is very finicky when it comes to building. I'm surprised they completely forgot about it. None of these wizards come here. I've always wondered what's down there.~ /*I'm surprised they've forgotten about it. None of them wizards ever visits. I've always wondered what goes on down there, myself.*/
@26 = ~Oh, no no no! I have the key, of course. There's just, well, zombies down there and such. They come up from time to time... that's why I keep the mausoleum under lock and key.~
@27 = ~Zombies?!~
@28 = ~Mm? Oh, yes, yes. They've been a bit restless for quite some time, now. I imagine it's one of those wizards down there, not quite as dead as he should be. You know how it goes.~
@29 = ~That doesn't frighten you?~
@30 = ~Us caretakers don't frighten easily. Besides... I imagine that fella's busy with his books. He won't be bothering me for quite some time.~
@31 = ~What books?~
@32 = ~Oh, did I say books? Err... no I didn't. I said he's busy with his looks... yeah, that's it. Those undead look a fright, you know...~
@33 = ~No, you said 'books'. I'm sure of it.~
@34 = ~MT: Well, lay it all out, wayward dwarf...~ /*Out with it, you crotchety gnome...*/
@35 = ~MT: Damn it! Good good. It just so happened that those idiot wizards left a whole collection of magical books there. I do not know why. They probably just forgot about them. It's their business, the wizards. I never had to see them, but my grandfather did. He said that these are huge books, completely covered with runes. Wizards still embroider their robes with such things. Like that sorceress who came here a couple of months ago... She kept looking for those books of hers. But she didn't get anything from me.~ /*Dang blast it! Fine, fine. It just so happens those fool wizards left a whole collection of magical books down there. I don't know why. I bet they just plain forgot about 'em, I guess. Leave it to wizards.*/
@36 = ~Anyhow, I imagine them books is connected to whatever strangeness is going on down there. I don't mind. I just takes things as they come.~
@37 = ~Why haven't you told anyone about this?~
@38 = ~MT: What is it about the sorceress?~ /*What wizard is this?*/
@39 = ~How about you give me that key and I'll go down there?~
@40 = ~MT: And who to tell? If you don't know, people already have a lot to worry about with plague, war, and so on. The city is closed, outside and the louse will not slip. I think that they will notice when a huge wave of zombies overwhelm them. There is a time for everything, as Grandpa used to say.~ /*Tell who? In case you haven't noticed, people are busy as bees with all their plagues and fighting and such. City's closed up tighter'n a salt merchant's pocketbook.*/
@41 = ~MT: I say. Some mages from Port Llast came here and looked for these old books. She said she was willing to pay a lot for them. But she refused to pay ME until I went and got her these books. Well, these magicians are stubborn.~ /*Just what I said. Some mage from Port Llast who came here lookin' for them old books. Said she'd pay a pretty price for 'em, too.*/
@42 = ~Let you plunder the tomb? Never! Err... not for less than 200 gold pieces, anyway.~
@43 = ~All right, then, 200 gold it is.~
@44 = ~I'll give 100 gold, though I'm sure this is a scam.~
@45 = ~I'm from the Arcane Brotherhood, actually. The key belongs to us.~
@46 = ~How about I take it off your dead body, gnome?~
@47 = ~Fair enough. Now git and satisfy your curiosity, damn it. I have work to do.~
@48 = ~MT: Robbing the poor old gnome, huh? Ahh, okay, that's awesome. Go ahead and take it.~ /*Hmph. Stealing from a little old gnome, eh? Ahhhh, fine, fine. Go ahead and take it.*/
@49 = ~Not on your life! The wizards entrusted me with, uh, the care of their friend. 200 gold pieces or you go about your business.~
@50 = ~Eh? Didn't you just ask me what the Arcane Brotherhood was?~
@51 = ~Yes, I guess I did.~
@52 = ~MT: I didn't ask anything, you're confusing something.~ /*Slow down. Me ask 'bout something else.*/
@53 = ~Yes, but we don't call it the Arcane Brotherhood anymore...~
@54 = ~What?! A graverobber?! Well, you won't get the best of me, you whipper-snapper!!~
@55 = ~I thought so. I ain't as old as I look, you know.~
@56 = ~MT: A. Apparently, gray ears are blocked again. I swear it did. I'm probably getting old. I assume you're going to bury someone else there? Hehe... Well, considering all those zombies, there should be enough room. Here... Hold the key and leave.~ /*I suppose you've got some more dead to put down there, eh? Heh heh... well, with all them zombies walking about, there'll be plenty of room. Here... take the key and git.*/
@57 = ~MT: Well, you have to, don't you? Again, I don't know. And what is it called now? Miraculous Spellcasters again? Ah, it doesn't matter. I assume you're going to bury someone else there? Hehe... Well, considering all those zombies, there should be enough room. Here... Hold the key and leave.~ /*I suppose you've got some more dead to put down there, eh? Heh heh... well, with all them zombies walking about, there'll be plenty of room. Here... take the key and git.*/
@58 = ~MT: I have a lot of work. Leave me alone, the devil would have taken you.~ /*No, I don't believe you! Leave me alone, I'm too frightened!*/
@59 = ~MT: Take your 500 gold, extortionist. I need a key.~ /*Perhaps so. 300 gold pieces, then... and no lower.*/
@60 = ~I've got work to do, especially with you messin' up my grounds. Leave me be, damn it.~
@61 = ~What do you know about this tome I found in the tomb?~
@62 = ~MT: Hm. So that's what grandpa was talking about. To me, it's just an old, beat-up cookbook. And it smells like an old sock. I don't know anything that could help you. Why don't you find the woman who's been asking around here? Said her name was Elvira. From Port Llast.~ /*I don't know nothin' that would help you out. Why don't you go find that woman that was askin' all them questions about it? Eltoora, she said her name was. From Port Llast.*/
@63 = ~Or burn it. Or donate it to some school where young'n wizards like to poke their tiny noses into places they don't belong. I have me graveyard to take care of, damn it! Off ye go!~
