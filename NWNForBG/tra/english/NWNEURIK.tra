@0 = ~Welcome to the Tyrran Temple - tell me, are you here for Tyr's services, or perhaps the Lady Luck herself has guided you to us during these dark days? Have you a need, then, my <BROTHERSISTER>? I shall help however I am able.~ /*Welcome to the Tyrran Temple - tell me, are you here for Tyr's services, or perhaps the Lady Luck herself has guided you to us during these dark days?*/
@1 = ~Who are you? My name is <CHARNAME>.~
@2 = ~Perhaps you need some assistance?~
@3 = ~What services does Tyr provide?~
@4 = ~I'd like to make a purchase from the temple.~
@5 = ~Goodbye.~
@6 = ~NP: Then go, and may Fortune bless your every step.~ /*On your way, then, citizen.*/
@7 = ~Oh, pardon my manners, good <BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME>. I am Neurik, the priest in charge of this Tyrran temple for good Port Llast.~
@8 = ~NP: Well,<BROTHERSISTER> , I will immediately enlighten you about all that Tyr can give you. Let me go into details. If you need healing scrolls or potions of any kind, then this is undoubtedly the best defense against all adversity ... If you need anything that can be useful to a representative of a loyal order, let me immediately assure you,<BROTHERSISTER> : You are in the right place.~ /*If you need anything that could be of use to one of the devoted order, well let me say right now, my <BROTHERSISTER>: you are in the right place.*/
@9 = ~Well... I'm hesitant to suggest the task because of the danger involved, but it's very important. You can be certain that I'll compensate you for the risk, should that matter to you.~
@10 = ~Tell me what you would have me do.~
@11 = ~Let's talk about something different.~
@12 = ~Have you a need, then, my <BROTHERSISTER>? I shall help however I am able.~
@13 = ~Of course, of course - do not let me keep you waiting. Tyr will wash his luck over you this day!~
@14 = ~Let me tell you how this started. A short time ago, a foul beast settled into the area of the town. At first, few of us knew of its presence. Indeed, Port Llast has known few troubles for many years. Slowly, however, we became aware. Several of our citizens disappeared without any trace... and always on the night of a full moon. Wolf prints were found, the howling was constant... we thought the town besieged. The trouble was from no pack of wolves, however... it came from a creature much more powerful and cunning: a werewolf. The famous hunter, Sir Karathis, was sent for with orders to slay this "Black Wolf" as we came to call it.~ /*The trouble was from no pack of wolves, however... it came from a creature much more powerful and cunning: a werewolf. The famous hunter, Sir Karathis, was sent for with orders to slay this "Black Wolf" as we came to call it.*/
@15 = ~Karathis took with him four of Port Llast's younger lads to aid his task but, unfortunately, the Black Wolf was merciless. He overcame the knight and attacked the four boys... and only young Ander managed to return to us unharmed. According to Ander, the three other boys were wounded but had managed to flee. I fear that this means the curse of the werewolf will have been passed onto them. If the boys are not found and cured or... or killed... we could very well be facing even more danger than from the Black Wolf alone.~ /*According to Ander, the three other boys were wounded but had managed to flee. I fear that this means the curse of the werewolf will have been passed onto them. If the boys are not found and cured or... or killed... we could very well be facing even more danger than from the Black Wolf alone.*/
@16 = ~I have silver charms here which may yet drive the curse from their blood. You must subdue the beasts first, however, and convince them to use the charms... if you can. And then the Black Wolf, himself, must be dealt with. As I said... a terrible but vital task.~
@17 = ~I will do this for you.~

@19 = ~I am listening. Let me ask about something else.~ /*Let me ask about something else.*/
@20 = ~You don't know how relieved I am here to hear that. Here, take the silver charms. Hopefully they can be used to cure all three boys and Sir Karathis, should he still live. Each of the boys wears a ring. They should give them up freely if cured. Bring them back to me, and then I'll know their situations are resolved.~ /*You don't know how relieved I am here to hear that. Here, take the silver charms. Hopefully they can be used to cure all three boys and Sir Karathis, should he still live.*/
@21 = ~I have some more questions about this job.~
@22 = ~I'm certain of it. What I've told you would be much for anyone to absorb. What would you wish to know, <BROTHERSISTER>?~
@23 = ~Where will I find these afflicted boys?~
@24 = ~Who is this Ander you mention?~
@25 = ~Where can I get the weapons to fight werewolves?~
@26 = ~The four of them - Bran, Geth, Urth, and Sir Karathis - are scattered about, and usually only to be found at night. Finding them will be difficult.~
@27 = ~Can you tell me anything about Bran?~
@28 = ~What do you know of Geth?~
@29 = ~Where might I find Urth?~
@30 = ~Do you know where Sir Karathis is?~
@31 = ~Let me ask about something else.~
@32 = ~Of course, I will answer all your questions.~
@33 = ~Ander is a youth who goes out of his way to help others. They're so naive and trusting at that age... If you care to speak with him, you'll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. Mind, however, that he's probably still shaken up from his experiences.~
@34 = ~I hope that it will come to such bloodletting only as a last resort. These are innocent lads under a curse. There is a peddler who came to town after hearing of our plight... his name is Alhelor. You'll find him at the Alliance Arms Inn. He can provide you with silvered arrows, as well as access to some belladonna. But please, use them only if you must.~ /*I hope that it will come to such bloodletting only as a last resort. These are innocent lads under a curse. There is a peddler who came to town after hearing of our plight... his name is Alhelor.*/
@35 = ~I've heard that he was last spotted in the Charwood area, though where, specifically, I could not say. Please don't let that dissuade you from looking. I'm sure luck will be on your side. Is there anything more about the boys you want to ask? I feel so helpless... If only I knew better where they might have gone...~
@36 = ~I know for fact that Geth traveled to the Neverwinter Wood. You know, he enjoyed being around people. I'd look for campgrounds or villages within the woods. He's sure to be close by.~
@37 = ~Urth, I'm afraid, could be anywhere. His family has been so very fearful for him and his whereabouts. To be unable to do something for their pain....~
@38 = ~Could I speak with his family?~
@39 = ~Yes, of course, the Eisenfeldts. Their farm is on the south end of Port Llast. Perhaps something they say will assist your search.~
@40 = ~Sir Karathis is a brave knight. Faced with his own corruption, I'm sure he would flee to the ends of the world. Perhaps if you can save the children, they will know where he might be.~
@41 = ~It's a miracle of luck to have you returned to us. After losing brave Sir Karathis to the Black Wolf, we can't help but be overly concerned with your welfare. Have you news for me, <BROTHERSISTER>? Or are you in need of something else?~ /*It's a miracle of luck to have you returned to us. After losing brave Sir Karathis to the Black Wolf, we can't help but be overly concerned with your welfare.*/
@42 = ~Alhelor is dead. I have his tooth, here.~
@43 = ~What exactly am I to do, again?~
@44 = ~I know the true identity of the Black Wolf, Neurik. It is Alhelor.~
@45 = ~I've not yet found Karathis or the Black Wolf.~
@46 = ~We must speak of the werewolves.~
@47 = ~Remind me what you needed help with...~
@48 = ~I have silver charms here which may yet drive the curse from their blood. You must subdue the beasts first, however, and convince them to use the charms... if you can. And then the Black Wolf, himself, must be dealt with. As I said... a terrible but vital task.~
@49 = ~It has been a dark day for Port Llast, but you have reminded us that the sun rises yet again. For the champion of Port Llast, here is a token of our gratitude.~
@50 = ~Thank you for this. Farewell.~

@52 = ~Port Llast can thank me better than this, aye?~
@53 = ~Port Llast is indebted to you <BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME> - our brave champion. Travel safely, and know that our thoughts are with you on this journey of yours.~
@54 = ~Oh? Ah... of course, of course. Here, I had some gold bundled aside, but it would be better spent going into your pockets. Forgive us for withholding this paltry sum.~
@55 = ~The people of Port Llast can only give so much. To ask more of them would be... please, be content with what you have.~
@56 = ~Putting an end to all this... to this curse that has plagued us in the form of the Black Wolf. I do not know why this creature has chosen to live amongst us as Alhelor, but his evil must be stopped. How many have died, or had their lives destroyed because of him? Geth, Bran, Urth... as well as the noble knight, Sir Karathis. I will permit this to go no further... find Alhelor and end his life, I beg you!~ /*How many have died, or had their lives destroyed because of him? Geth, Bran, Urth... as well as the noble knight, Sir Karathis. I will permit this to go no further... find Alhelor and end his life, I beg you!*/
@57 = ~I will do as you ask.~
@58 = ~Will there be a reward for this task, too?~
@59 = ~I cannot accept this job now.~
@60 = ~Do you speak truly? Alhelor? But he - if that is the case, I... almost cannot bring myself to say this. But, he needs to be... destroyed. The curse of the Black Wolf must be ended so it will never be spread to innocents again. I wish I need not ask it of you, but would you seek out Alhelor and do what must be done? Please, <BROTHERSISTER>... do this and bring me his tooth so that I will know once and for all that the danger is over.~ /*I wish I need not ask it of you, but would you seek out Alhelor and do what must be done? Please, <BROTHERSISTER>... do this and bring me his tooth so that I will know once and for all that the danger is over.*/
@61 = ~I know I can trust you. Your efforts have been... far beyond anything we could have hoped for. End it quickly, <BROTHERSISTER>. Let Tyr guide your hand in the name of justice.~

@63 = ~It goes without saying that I would reward you for the task... but only if you return with a tooth of the beast. I must be sure that the deed is done.~
@64 = ~I wish you would say otherwise, though it is wrong for me to do so... should you change your mind I'll be here, and so will your reward. I hope you'll reconsider.~
@65 = ~I have no fear that you will do well in this endeavour. Time might not be on our side, but luck is. I know it. Have you a need, then, my <BROTHERSISTER>? I shall help however I am able.~ /*I have no fear that you will do well in this endeavour. Time might not be on our side, but luck is. I know it.*/
@66 = ~A grim topic, though I find I can think of little else. Have you been successful?~
@67 = ~I've some questions about the boys you wish cured.~
@68 = ~I've had some success in finding the boys, actually.~
@69 = ~I want to ask something else.~
@70 = ~Certainly, <BROTHERSISTER>, I will answer all your questions.~
@71 = ~I've heard that he was last spotted in the Charwood area, though where, specifically, I could not say. Please don't let that dissuade you from looking. I'm sure luck will be on your side.~
@72 = ~Truly! I had little doubt that you would do well. Oh, Port Llast is lucky indeed to have you in its midst.~
@73 = ~I found all three of them. Here are their rings.~
@74 = ~I found Urth. Here is his ring.~
@75 = ~I found Bran. Here is his ring.~
@76 = ~I found Geth. Here is his ring.~
@77 = ~What wondrous luck has been shown to Port Llast! What a wondrous hero to come to our aid! You have survived, and brought the children from death with you! All the boys have now been accounted for. It is a relief to see that some measure of peace has been restored at last. Your heroism has served us well, <BROTHERSISTER>. Take this reward, and my thanks.~ /*All the boys have now been accounted for. It is a relief to see that some measure of peace has been restored at last. Your heroism has served us well, <BROTHERSISTER>. Take this reward, and my thanks.*/
@78 = ~If only all of this were over with. Sir Karathis remains at large... as does the Black Wolf, himself. The task yet remains to track them both, <BROTHERSISTER>. You will, of course, be rewarded once again when that is done, I assure you.~
@79 = ~NP: I understand. It's a pity that not all the boys managed to be kept alive, isn't it? Although this loss is regrettable, our request was granted, and you are not to be blamed. We are all grateful to you.~ /*I see. The curse has taken the life of the young lad, has it? Sad though the loss might be, you have done what was asked of you and cannot be faulted. We are all grateful.*/
@80 = ~It's said that if but one life can be spared, then we have all been touched with luck. Port Llast will give its love to young Urth, both in remembrance, and to honor your deeds. What's that about your other clients?~ /*It's said that if but one life can be spared, then we have all been touched with luck. Port Llast will give its love to young Urth, both in remembrance, and to honor your deeds.*/
@81 = ~NP: Any day marked by death must be sad for everyone, as sad as it is for Urth. Port Llast will always remember young Urth. We need to find the other boys.~ /*Any day that is touched with death must be a sad one, as it is for Urth. Truly, however. we are blessed to have witnessed two lives kept from that same death by your able hands.*/

@90 = ~I can only hope that your appearance here suggests that you have heard our pleading, and that you intend to end Alhelor where we could not. Tell me, is my hope proven true?~
@91 = ~<BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME> - how... how do things progress? Is Alhelor - the Black Wolf - dead? I don't think a single soul within Port Llast has stopped to take breath.~
@92 = ~Port Llast is seeing its mysteries resolved - the werewolf forms of Urth, Bran, and Geth are no longer. But still - there's no news on Karathis or the Black Wolf. Is there anything you know, my <BROTHERSISTER>?~
@93 = ~Welcome back, my <BROTHERSISTER> <CHARNAME>. It's my pleasure, as always, to welcome you to Tyr's temple, now that things are as they belong in Port Llast.~
