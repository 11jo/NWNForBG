@0 = ~My name is Igland of the Swift Sword. I am the special prosecutor in the investigation of the death of the Lords' Alliance mercenary known as Griff, and I would like to remind the jury that I have never lost a case. **Never**.~
@1 = ~The witnesses have been sworn in, and may the light of Tyr's justice shine down on this trial and expose any lies in their testimony. To begin my case I would like to question Lodar, an eye-witness to the events.~
@2 = ~I'm not the judge, Lodar, just the prosecutor. You don't have to be so formal. Just call me sir. Please tell us what happened in your own words.~
@3 = ~That is all I require from this witness. Were it up to me we could end the trial right now and declare Rolgan guilty. But custom dictates I allow the defense to question the witness if they wish.~
@4 = ~If defense council has finished trying to obscure the truth, I will call Zed, my next witness. Zed, tell the court what you witnessed on that night.~
@5 = ~Well spoken, Zed. He ran off like a murderous coward. Obviously he's guilty. They always run when they're guilty. This case might be my easiest win yet. Your witness, <CHARNAME>.~
@6 = ~If the defense has finished with their blathering, the prosecution has only one witness left. I call on Vanda, the wife of the accused.~
