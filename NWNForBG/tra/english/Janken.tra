@0 = ~Hello there good <PRO_SIRMAAM>. How can old Janken be of help to you?~
@1 = ~Tell me about yourself.~
@2 = ~What is this place?~
@3 = ~Who's in charge around here?~
@4 = ~Nevermind. Goodbye.~
@5 = ~NP: I doubt my personality will be of much interest to you. I won't have much to tell you, but I think I'll share a few things. I am a druid and have been a member of this grove for about fourteen years now. I used to be second in command here after the Archdruid. But I grew tired of that responsibility and decided to devote myself instead to improving my combat skills. I am now the defender of the grove's second circle.~ /*I doubt you would be very interested in me. Not too much to tell, but I guess I could share a bit. I'm a druid and have been a member of this grove for about fourteen years now. I used to be the second-in-command around here.*/
@6 = ~NP: What do you mean, a second-round pick?~ /*Ring of the Second Circle*/
@7 = ~NP: Aren't you too old to fight?~ /*You're pretty mouthy for a henchman.*/
@8 = ~This is the Neverwinter Wood grove. We are druids who have come together to study and protect nature. Of course my role here is a little different than that.~
@9 = ~What is your role here?~
@10 = ~Just couldn't fit in here?~
@11 = ~Nevermind. Goodbye.~
@12 = ~NP: Aavil is our archdruid. He's been here even longer than I have, though I can still remember when he was much lower in the hierarchy. He has certainly earned his position of honor. He's currently researching the causes of animal attacks in the forest. Is there anything else I can help you with?~ /*Aawill is the Archdruid. He has been here even longer than I have, though I still remember when he was much farther down in the chain of command. He has definitely earned his place of respect. He is looking into the attacks by the animals of the woods right now.*/
@13 = ~What is wrong with the animals?~
@14 = ~NP: I'm clear. Goodbye.~ /*That is all. Goodbye.*/
@15 = ~Well, take care then. Goodbye.~
@16 = ~NP: Jaer, a very serious young woman over there, is talking to druids who want to improve their position in the grove. She sets up test battles between aspirants and defenders of their respective circle. I like that I don't have to get into the whole business anymore; I just fight, that's all. When I was younger, I would just throw myself forward and that was it. Now I have more wisdom, and I fight like a wolf: biting, bouncing back, never opening up vulnerabilities.~ /*I like that I don't have to worry about the details anymore; I just have to fight. When I was younger, that used to mean full frontal assault. Now I have more wisdom and I fight like a wolf; snap in and out, never leaving myself open.*/
@17 = ~Not that the animals in this wood are fighting with intelligence, but that's another subject entirely. Do you have questions you would like to ask about anything else?~
@18 = ~Can I challenge you?~
@19 = ~You know, I always thought I would retire and relax in some peaceful little cottage in the woods by this point in life, but the lure of one-on-one combat holds me here. I guess it just makes me feel more alive.~
@20 = ~So how does one get involved in this combat?~
@21 = ~Aren't you worried about getting killed in these fights?~
@22 = ~NP: No, that's not exactly what I meant. Most people come here to work with nature, but some find other things to do. That's what happened to me. I love nature, and I was even entrusted with the role of deputy for merit. But I grew tired of that responsibility and decided to devote myself to improving my combat skills instead. I am now the defender of the second circle of the grove.~ /*No, that's not exactly what I meant. Most people come here seeking to work with nature, but some find a different role to play. That's what happened to me.*/
@23 = ~NP: Animals attack anyone who dares to approach the forest. I believe there's something wrong with the Spirit. Several druids have gone to find out what's wrong, but they haven't returned yet. If you want to help, talk to Aavill. Aavill is the archdruid of this grove. He makes all the major decisions and usually has more information than everyone else. Is there anything else you want to ask?~ /*The animals have attacked people who step foot anywhere near the Wood. I believe there is something wrong with the Spirit. Some druids have been sent to investigate the matter, but they haven't returned yet. You should speak to Aawill if you want to help.*/
@24 = ~NP: Only the druids of our grove are tested to gain a new status. Talk to Jhaer if you want to know more about it. Is there something else?~ /*Druids may challenge for admittance to the grove. Talk to Jaer if you want more details about it. Anything else?*/
@25 = ~The fights aren't to the death and the loser is always healed. Even if I did die, and they couldn't raise me, I can't think of a better way to go. In a wolf pack, the dominant wolf eventually gets old and is beaten by a younger wolf. That's just life.~
@26 = ~I see you have returned. What may I do for you?~
@27 = ~NP: I hear you've been talking to Aavill about helping the forest. I wish you luck in that endeavor.~ /*I know Neurik appreciates all you have done to aid the Temple in this matter.*/
@28 = ~NP: Nature thanks you for your deeds. Thank you!~ /*Nature's thanks to you.*/
@29 = ~NP: You killed the spirit of the forest! The forest will never be the same again. Go away.~ /*The forest will never be the same.*/
