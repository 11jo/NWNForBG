@0 = ~Gone... all gone... There's nothing left.~
@1 = ~Who are you?~
@2 = ~What happened here?~
@3 = ~Goodbye.~
@4 = ~Does my name matter? I was Jace, but I'm nothing now. It's all gone. My home, my family. They burned it.~
@5 = ~MT: They were sick. They were struck by the Howling Death. I took care of them as best I could, but they got infected anyway. I couldn't help. My children. My wife. All are dead. My house? Infected. What was I to do? I burned it. I burned everything.~ /*They were sick, you see. They got the Wailing. I took every precaution, but they still got it. I couldn't do anything to help.*/
@6 = ~You burned down your own home?~
@7 = ~Is there anything I can do for you?~
@8 = ~That's tough luck, all right.~
@9 = ~There's nothing left here... all gone...~
@10 = ~MT: Could I sleep in the bed they died in? Living within walls that have been seen to dry? I don't know much about diseases, but I do know that they are spreading. We lived in seclusion, took all measures, but my family died. Somehow the plague got through. How could I live there? Even if I had it... I see my family in every shadow. How can I live now?~ /*Should I sleep in the bed they died in? Live in the walls that saw them wither? I don't know much about plagues, but I know they spread.*/
@11 = ~MT: No I dont know. Find a cure for the Howling Death? How about this? Eh... that would be something... if they found him... no, too late. No, there's nothing you can do for me. I have nothing left.~ /*No... I don't know. Cure the Wailing Death? How about that? Heh... wouldn't that be something... if it were cured now... too late.*/
@12 = ~So you have absolutely nothing left at all?~
@13 = ~MT: Yes, that's what I got. Indifference. Who needs my life... my family... when the whole city is afflicted with pestilence. Howling... she's everywhere. Nothing... we are all nothing. How can my suffering compare to this? They mean nothing.~ /*Yes, that's what I get. Indifference. Who cares about my life... my family, when the whole city is plagued. The Wailing... it's everywhere.*/
@14 = ~Well... I guess I have the shirt on my back, but I should probably burn that too. I'll have to buy another at the Twenty in a Quiver, I suppose.~
@15 = ~Ah-HA! If you can buy a shirt, you've got gold! Give it to me!~
@16 = ~W-what?! Is that all you want? Filthy thief! No! I say no! What are you going to do, kill me? So what! I've got nothing to live for anyway! Go ahead!~
@17 = ~I won't kill you. I'll say you killed your family. You'll rot in prison for their murders!~
@18 = ~I'm sorry. I lost my head for a moment. I apologize.~
@19 = ~MT: You... you are a monster! I will never be able to justify myself if the guard says that I am guilty. I won't be allowed to mourn... no one will look at me the same way again... Take away, you vicious, most vicious piece of manure. Leave me with my ashes... GO!~ /*You... you monster! I'd never be able to prove I didn't do it, not with a guard like you saying I did. No one would let me mourn... no one would look at me the same again...*/
@20 = ~Whatever. Look, why don't you just leave me alone. I don't really want to talk to anyone right now.~
@21 = ~Get away from me, you evil sack of filth! Get away from my ashes!~
