@0 = ~What do you want? Come on now, I've got time if you're quick.~
@1 = ~Could I ask you some questions?~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~I've the time, sure enough. What do you want to know?~
@4 = ~Know anything about the plague?~
@5 = ~Anything odd happening here?~
@6 = ~What locations are important in the Docks district?~
@7 = ~All right then. Farewell.~
@8 = ~No, and I don't care to. I ain't even thinking about it. Of course, I guess I showed up here... well, we're all here for strange reasons.~
@9 = ~Well, just look around you. Bloodsailors looking all rough, some auction thing taking too long, and damned if I have seen any Bloodsailor brass here all night.~
@10 = ~I want to ask about the Bloodsailors.~
@11 = ~I want to ask about the auction.~
@12 = ~I'd rather ask you about something else.~
@13 = ~Ain't much anywhere now. Plague shut most things down. I suppose you can ask, but there ain't much I can tell you. There's still the Golden Apple and the Twenty in a Quiver. A couple other places, I guess. I just stay here at the Seedy, myself.~ /*There's still the Golden Apple and the Twenty in a Quiver. A couple other places, I guess. I just stay here at the Seedy, myself.*/
@14 = ~Tell me about the Seedy Tavern.~
@15 = ~Tell me about the Golden Apple.~
@16 = ~Tell me about the Twenty in a Quiver.~
@17 = ~I'm looking for basic services. General stuff.~
@18 = ~Their business ain't my concern, especially their infighting... I really shouldn't say any more. I don't swim well, especially in a sack filled with rocks.~
@19 = ~Come now, telling me won't do any harm.~
@20 = ~NP: You're a Dwarf, like me. Why don't you just let it go?~ /*We both have <RACE> blood. Why not give me a break?*/
@21 = ~Come now, handsome. You can tell me, can't you?~
@22 = ~Nobody seems to know what was going to happen here. Vengaul Bloodsail himself was organizing it, but he's late. It may be cancelled. I heard that there was a plague cure for sale. Rumors were all over, and I think some people were afraid the guards would hear. I don't know how they didn't. It was like Vengaul wanted them to know. He's flashy. A risk taker. Some of his men don't like it.~ /*I don't know how they didn't. It was like Vengaul wanted them to know. He's flashy. A risk taker. Some of his men don't like it.*/
@23 = ~Eh, if you make it quick.~
@24 = ~This place? This is where everything happens. It's where they usually set up the black market, but things are a little strange right now.~
@25 = ~What do you mean when you say "strange?"~
@26 = ~NP: "The Golden Apple? It's a nice little tavern. Not much going on in it though. sidi's tavern is where you have to go to see the buzz of life. "The Golden Apple is in the southern part of the neighborhood, if you're interested.~ /*The Golden Apple? A fine little tavern. Not much happens there, though. The Seedy Tavern is where you want to be for action.*/
@27 = ~Eh, it's the only place that's doing any business now. Lots of this and that, though most of the black market stuff there ends up here. It's a little southeast of the Seedy Tavern here. Kinda middle northeast of the district, I guess.~ /*Eh, it's the only place that's doing any business now. Lots of this and that, though most of the black market stuff there ends up here.*/
@28 = ~Eh, you'll be stuck shopping here or the Twenty in a Quiver. Most other places are gone because of the plague. You'll have to go to the City Core if you are looking for things like temples and mage towers.~ /*Eh, you'll be stuck shopping here or the Twenty in a Quiver. Most other places are gone because of the plague.*/
@29 = ~I suppose you're right. They are probably too busy to worry about me telling tales anyway. The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.~ /*The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.*/
@30 = ~Tell me about Vengaul.~
@31 = ~Tell me about Callik.~
@32 = ~Sorry, but I'm just not getting involved. Callik wants to challenge Vengaul, that's his business, not mine and not yours.~
@33 = ~I suppose I could say a few things. I'll just lay low for a while after so I don't get in trouble. The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.~ /*The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.*/
@34 = ~Well, I suppose there's not really any harm in me talking with you. I can just lay low a while if I get myself in trouble. The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.~ /*The Bloodsailors weren't always a rough group to deal with, but things have changed. Callik isn't letting Vengaul's decisions go unchallenged anymore.*/
@35 = ~Ah, the well-loved leader and founder of the Bloodsailors. Well, not so well-loved these days, I hear. See, he likes to show off. All of his plans usually involve getting as much notice as possible. He's more concerned with image than profit. That doesn't please some of his men. I hear he's been getting some trouble from his officers. They want to be a little more rough, and a lot less flashy.~ /*Ah, the well-loved leader and founder of the Bloodsailors. Well, not so well-loved these days, I hear. See, he likes to show off.*/
@36 = ~Is that why he's not here tonight?~
@37 = ~Callik... well, Callik is not a nice man. He's much more concerned with gold than he is with any show of bravado or style. He's very efficient getting gold out of his victims, but he's a hard man to work for. If not for Vengaul, he'd be even worse. Some of the Bloodsailors prefer working for him, and I think it's getting to the point where he's going to challenge Vengaul.~ /*He's very efficient getting gold out of his victims, but he's a hard man to work for. If not for Vengaul, he'd be even worse.*/
@38 = ~Does he have the backing to do that?~
@39 = ~Oh, the Vengaul I know likes confrontation. He wouldn't run from a fight. I think whatever was supposed to happen up here has been changed. Ain't my business, like I said, but I saw some of Callik's boys going downstairs, and now the basement is locked up tight. Something is going on... I just don't know what.~ /*Oh, the Vengaul I know likes confrontation. He wouldn't run from a fight. I think whatever was supposed to happen up here has been changed.*/
@40 = ~Callik is pretty powerful right now. A lot of the Bloodsailors wouldn't mind making a little more profit instead of playing for show. In fact, Callik has taken over running the black market. He's one of the few guys I've seen with a key to get downstairs. I thought he'd be here. Not like him to sit in his house while something is happening. He'd really like to embarrass Vengaul.~ /*I thought he'd be here. Not like him to sit in his house while something is happening. He'd really like to embarrass Vengaul.*/
@41 = ~Where is his house?~
@42 = ~NP: Hmm? I think it's just east of the center of the neighborhood. But I wouldn't advise you to go there. Unless, of course, you're looking for trouble.~ /*Hmm? I think it was in the far northeast corner of the district. I wouldn't go poking around there, though. Not unless you want trouble.*/
@43 = ~Well met, friend. Fine night in the inn, eh. Right busy, it is.~
@44 = ~Go on, why are you bothering me? I've no interest in you.~
@45 = ~Ah, I got no reason to talk. No more auction, no more fighting. Nothing happening now, so you might as well leave me be.~
