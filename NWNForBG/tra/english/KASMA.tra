@0 = ~Oh, hullo. It's quite busy in here, isn't it?~
@1 = ~Probably people preparing for the competition.~
@2 = ~Yes, it is. Do you know why?~
@3 = ~It certainly is. Who are you?~
@4 = ~I will leave.~
@5 = ~Oh, yes. And people preparing to watch, as well. We should have quite a crowd. It's all very exciting! I can't wait to enter the dungeon!~
@6 = ~Aren't you nervous or afraid at all?~
@7 = ~A puny gnome like you is entering? You've no hope!~
@8 = ~NP: Everyone came because of Mutamin's idea... adventurers like me will try to get through the dungeon under the tavern. They say it's full of traps and monsters... and the first one to reach the end will be rewarded. Well, fame too, of course. As far as I understand, all this is kept secret. Local aristocrats gathered here to admire the violence. This could make for a great story.~ /*It's all very secretive, I understand. The noblemen are here because they like a good scandal and love to watch violence. It should make for a good story.*/
@9 = ~If you're truly interested, you might want to speak to Mutamin about it. He would know far more than I, of course.~
@10 = ~My name is Kasma. I'm a bard from Baldur's Gate. I've traveled quite a ways to take part in the competition. It's quite exciting!~
@11 = ~What's this competition you mention?~
@12 = ~All righty, then. Good luck to ya!~
@13 = ~No, not really. Just determined. I want to walk away from here with a tale to tell the countryside. Now *that* would be worth any price!~
@14 = ~If you say so. I wish you well, anyway.~
@15 = ~I wish you luck, friend! Whichever of us wins the prize, I hope you at least aren't hurt.~
@16 = ~Oh dear, this was harder than I thought.~
