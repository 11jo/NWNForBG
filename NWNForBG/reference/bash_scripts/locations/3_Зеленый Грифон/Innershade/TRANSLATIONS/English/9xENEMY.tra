@0    = ~Dream. Isn't it? You are here for the first time, yet it is not. It is not one of yours, yet you decided to interfere...like those who were digging here. I just could not stand all those noises. I wanted to sleep as I had. Now I can do it no longer...~
@1    = ~You may kill me...Do you think I want to avoid it? Do you think my wish was to stay here for all eternity? No...that was never my decision.~
@2    = ~I wanted you to come to this place...to the inner dream...~
@3    = ~Find my every piece now. Will you end this now? Can finding the pieces end this? I do not know. If I have ever known the answer to how I could rest for eternity. But I cannot do it by my own, no matter how great my wish will become.~
@4    = ~Yes, I feel weaker now. The pieces are gone...Maybe you are the answer? Maybe you are able to end this journey. Try it now.~
@5    = ~Do it here, again, for the last time, outside the dream. I can almost feel the end...But I have to fight. I do not want to stand. I am sorry, it is my nature. You have to understand.~
@6    = ~Why I can't reach my end? I am tired of everything...I will show you my true form. I need your help.~
@7    = ~This is how I truly appear. For the mercy of all beings, please, end this. I have had enough of this never-ending existence. I will tell you my story...if you wish to listen.~
@8    = ~This must be torment for you. Do you really wish to die? Why can't you stop this? What is all this? What are you?~
@9    = ~I will kill you now, and this time you won't be reborn, monster.~
@10   = ~If only I knew everything...I am all the dreams a witch had, and could have. All her wishes, nightmares and daydreams...her desires and memories of that which she wanted to become, and of who she wanted to be. All of that appeared to be impossible for her to reach.~
@11   = ~She could not stand me, she was unable to face her own creations, her own dreams that she wanted to come true. She wanted them so much, so they...no, not them. I became too great a burden. She decided to leave me, removed me from her mind, heart, and soul. She became dreamless. I was laid to rest here, under her former home. I waited as long as I could, but then even my greed was not controllable. Why did she leave me?...How could she rid herself of...of her memories...her wishes?~
@12   = ~I could not wait...I woke up, I wanted to find her, yet instead I brought much pain and death. No one remains in the caves; they are all gone. If you wanted to find the reason for their disappearance, it stands here, right before your eyes.~
@13   = ~Believe me, I want to disappear, I want to be forgotten, but I am still reborn. I feel weak now. I feel as though I could just disappear, like it would take only one more death of mine to reach peace. Yet, the decision is yours. Find a way to stop my torment. I beg you.~
@14   = ~Death is the simplest way, creature. Can you become part of someone else other than your creator?~
@15   = ~So, I will end this here. Prepare to die, creature.~
@16   = ~Yes, I can. Yet, it may be painful for both myself and the heart and soul I will join. It will take some time for my host to get used to the change.~
@17   = ~I'll take the risk. Become a part of me, dream. I won't destroy such a being as you. You'll be able to live again. See it as a chance, not as another torment, my friend.~
@18   = ~Well, I won't risk it. Prepare to die.~
@19   = ~So, this is not the end just yet? Nevertheless, I agree. Show me that grief is not everything that is left.~
@20   = ~(Suddenly you feel energy entering your body, traveling through your veins. You feel the beating of your heart as though it was a war drum. Everything ends as rapidly as it began, but a sensation of chill is left. You also feel a strange being within your body.)~
@21   = ~Thank you...(You make the final strike. The creature's form shatters as though it was made of glass.)~
