@0 = ~Good morrow to you, citizen. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they're replacing the ones we've lost, are they?~
@1 = ~I need to ask a few questions.~
@2 = ~Goodbye.~
@3 = ~Hmm, the more information you have, the less risk you'll pose to the rest of us on duty. I'll help if I can.~
@4 = ~I need infomation about places in Neverwinter.~
@5 = ~What do you know of the plague?~
@6 = ~Have you heard of anything odd? Any rumors?~
@7 = ~Stay alive out there, recruit.~
@8 = ~Well, you can't keep the peace without knowing where to keep it, can you? Sorry, it's an old guard joke my buddy used to tell before... nevermind.~
@9 = ~What are the different areas of the city?~
@10 = ~Where can I get equipment?~
@11 = ~I know what I'm told. Aribeth and her lot handle all the delicate stuff. We common guards keep the peace where we can and maintain the quarantine at all costs.~
@12 = ~You sound like you don't particularly like Aribeth.~
@13 = ~What do you know about attempts at a cure?~
@14 = ~NP: There is another question.~ /*I want to ask something else.*/
@15 = ~NP: All I hear is that things are getting worse and that we are losing more and more people. Just like war, only Howling Death wont give up. When were gone, every county will have its own intrigues, thats for sure. I only know that we have no chance, even here, in the center...~ /*With us gone, the different districts each hold their intrigues, I'm sure. All I know is that we're fighting a losing battle, even here in the Core...*/
@16 = ~NP: The city has always been divided into districts, but with the introduction of quarantine, they were all closed. Now each district lives in its own way. Which one do you want to know about? There is the Beggars Nest, the port, the Black Lake, the peninsula and the Heart of the City. You need to know about everything.~ /*Which do you have questions about? There's the Beggar's Nest, the Docks, the Blacklake district, the Peninsula, and the City Core? You need to know them all.*/
@17 = ~Tell me about the City Core.~
@18 = ~Tell me about the Beggar's Nest.~
@19 = ~Tell me about the Docks district.~
@20 = ~Tell me about the Blacklake district.~
@21 = ~Tell me about the Peninsula.~
@22 = ~There are several merchants in the City Core, but some are raising prices like there's no tomorrow. Of course, they might be right...~
@23 = ~NP: She generally ensures the security of the city and reports to Lord Nasher. She brings people like you on special missions, and we just have to keep an eye on the robbers who have completely lost their minds from this plague. Im sorry, but I dont think shes more important than all those who have already been taken by the Howling Death!~ /*She handles city security on a big scale, reporting to Lord Nasher. She brings in people like you for special missions, leaving us for little things like, oh, restraining plague-maddened rioters.*/
@24 = ~NP: Nothing. I once heard of Waterdeep creatures, but a lot of time has passed since then. My job is to guard the streets from rebels and marauders. I know those damned Helmits keep getting in our way. I swear their blessings dont do half of what they say.~ /*Not a thing. I was briefed on the Waterdhavian creatures, but nothing since. My life's on the line to keep the streets clear of rioters and looters.*/
@25 = ~What were you told about the Waterdhavian creatues?~
@26 = ~NP: The caravan that was carrying them was attacked as it entered the city. No one knows what happened to them afterwards - probably dispelled by the wind. They didnt tell me the details. They just told me to keep an eye out for them to show up somewhere.~ /*That the caravan bringing them was attacked when it entered the city. Nobody knows what happened to them after that - scattered to the wind, I guess.*/
@27 = ~NP: The heart of the city is the business district around Nevers Castle. We managed to protect him from the plague, but not completely ... The rule of law is maintained here, and in the most strict way. It never hurts, especially now that the plague is ravaging the city. Of course, most of the remaining guards are here, and there are almost none left in other areas. Hope you can help the situation.~ /*Of course, with most of what remains of the militia here, the other Districts are suffering. Hopefully that's where you can help.*/
@28 = ~The Beggar's Nest is hurting bad. There's a lot of poverty - I've already lost three of my men to violence there and another eight to Wailing.~
@29 = ~NP: The plague first appeared there. The first sick people were ignored, considering it a &quot;problem of the poor&quot;, but now everything has changed ... People are building barricades everywhere, and there are even rumors that the undead are walking around the streets. Im afraid the guards cant help much here.~ /*People are barricading wherever they can, and there are even rumors of undead walking the streets. I'm afraid there's not much the guards can do to help.*/
@30 = ~You not saying everything.~
@31 = ~NP: Look, guards are needed to keep order and maintain quarantine. We hunt the living, not the dead. Were all scared, dont you see? And it wouldnt hurt you either! Cant wait to get involved in what awaits you there - forward and with a song. Good luck. Previously, no one cared about the beggar quarter, and now there is no need to save it. But remember that I lost people there, much better than you.~ /*Nobody cared about the Beggar's Nest before and it's not vital we save it now. Just remember that I've lost better men than you in there.*/
@32 = ~NP: Although the situation is improving. Someone restored a semblance of order - destroyed a whole nest of undead. This will greatly facilitate our work. Maybe you have something to do with it? If so, thanks. Since then it has been much quieter here.~ /*Things are looking up, though. Somebody restored a semblance of order - Destroyed a whole infestation of undead. It sure makes our job a lot easier.*/
@33 = ~The Docks are a nightmare to patrol even at the best of times. There's dirty gold there. Not a lot of respect for the city guards.~
@34 = ~NP: The plague brought out all their worst sides. There was some panic about money. I do not know why. The rich also die. There is little we can do. This place is now owned by robbers and gangs of thugs. I think they won...~ /*The Wailing's brought out the worst in them. There's a panic for gold for some reason. Not sure why. The rich die too.*/
@35 = ~NP: There was a little commotion, but now everything has calmed down. Maybe you had a hand in this? Well, if so. Not much is happening here right now, although my people continue to die from the Howling Plague. But we are monitoring the situation.~ /*Anyway, not much happening in there now, though I'm still losing men to the Wailing. We'll keep an eye on it though.*/
@36 = ~Blacklake? Bunch of spoiled nobles. I don't think they've had a good word for the guards in the history of the city. And there's those rumors...~
@37 = ~NP: The people interpret that the rich have found a cure, but they will not share it with the rest. It may not be true, but it is very similar to them. I heard them openly threaten my guards. If they are not restrained, everything here will go to hell.~ /*People are saying the nobles stumbled on a cure and they won't share it with the rest of us. Probably not true, but it would be just like them.*/
@38 = ~In fact, I think they were talking revolt for a while, but somebody put a stop to it. Was that you? My thanks go out to you if it was.~
@39 = ~NP: There is a prison on the peninsula. Most of the prison employees and those who were released from it live there. This place is run by Captain Eleifin. I hope he manages because hes one of the best the city has to offer for this job... There was some talk about a prison riot. Tyr sees, we have never been able to intimidate the prisoners, but maybe the plague succeeded ...~ /*Captain Alaefin runs the place and I hope he's doing okay because he's one of the best the city has to offer...*/
@40 = ~NP: There is a prison on the peninsula. Most of the employees of the prison and those who were released from it live there. I dont know exactly what happened here, but things seem to have calmed down now. But this had to be paid dearly. Captain Eleifin was a good man and I am grateful to anyone who helped him. The rebellion is finally crushed.~ /*I'm not sure what all happened in there, but it seems to have calmed down now. Hell of a price to pay, though.*/
@41 = ~NP: Watch out I dont catch you near the Moonstone Mask. Its in the southeast, right at the main gate. You look suspicious... They trade with suspicious and extravagant personalities. I think they have wonderful things that you canâ€™t get everywhere ... At least legally. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Sword Fair, to the southeast. There are good mercenaries.~ /*They cater to the shady and the flamboyant. I suppose they do stock the odd thing that can't be had elsewhere... not legally, anyway.*/
@42 = ~NP: Do you need to replenish natural reserves? Its noticeable to you. Go to the Druid Tree in the Heart of the City, its in the southwest of the district, next to the gate. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Sword Fair, to the southeast. There are good mercenaries.~ /*You need nature-related supplies, don't you? You look the type. You should visit the Druid Tree in the City Core upper square east.*/
@43 = ~NP: You look... I dont know, pious or something. Maybe youre looking for the Temple of Tyr? Its in the Heart of the City, to the west, next to Nevers Castle. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Sword Fair, to the southeast. There are good mercenaries.~ /*You look... I don't know, devout, I guess. You might want to check out the Temple of Tyr in the City Core upper square west.*/
@44 = ~NP: You are a spellcaster, right? The Cloak Tower is located in the east of the district, most likely you are there. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Sword Fair, to the southeast. There are good mercenaries.~ /*And if you want someone to back you up, check the Trade of Blades mercenary enclave in the southwest. Good people there.*/
@45 = ~NP: Are you good at fighting? Shining Arms and Armor has the best stuff - I always buy from them. Its south of the main square. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Sword Fair, to the southeast. There are good mercenaries.~ /*You good with a weapon? Shining Knight Arms and Armor has the best gear - I shop there myself. They're in the southeast City Core.*/
@46 = ~NP: You must have many talents. A warrior should definitely go to &quot;Shining Weapons and Armor for Knights&quot;, magicians are advised to look into the Cloak Tower, for priests we have the temple of Tyr, those who are interested in nature should visit the Druid Tree. Well, thieves are welcome in the Mask of the Moonstone. If you need someone to watch your back, head to the Sword Fair, to the southeast. There are good mercenaries.~ /*The workmanship responsible for this item is questionable, at best. A small plaque declares it to be a partially nude representation of Ophala Cheldarstorn of the Moonstone Mask, but you cannot see how it could be an accurate likeness.*/
@47 = ~Can I help you? I cannot be away from my duty for long. Wait... are you a new recruit? Aye, they're replacing the ones we've lost...~
@48 = ~You have my attention. Wait, you're one of the patchwork recruits, aren't you? Ahh, you're no substitute for experience.~
